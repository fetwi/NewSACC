<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     <strong>Canadian good</strong>: A good wholly manufactured or originating in Canada 
       is considered a Canadian good.  A product containing imported 
       components may also be considered Canadian for the purpose of this 
       policy when it has undergone sufficient change in Canada, in a 
       manner that satisfies the definition specified under the North 
       American Free Trade Agreement Rules of Origin (see <em>Supply Manual</em>, 
       Annex 5.5: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/acquisitions/text/sm/chapter05-e.html
       #annex5.5</strong>).

       For the purposes of this determination, the reference in the NAFTA 
       Rules of Origin to "territory", is to be replaced with "Canada".  
       For photocopiers, computers and office equipment within Federal 
       Supply Classification (FSC) groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products 
       of MERIT/CIRCLE firms or companies in Priority Group 1 prior to 
       April 1992 are considered Canadian (see paragraph 7.(a)).

2.     <strong>Canadian service</strong>: A service provided by an individual based in 
       Canada is considered a Canadian service.  Where a requirement 
       consists of only one service, which is being provided by more than 
       one individual, the service will be considered Canadian if a minimum 
       of 80 percent of the total bid price for the service is provided by 
       individuals based in Canada.

3.     <strong>Variety of goods</strong>: When requirements consist of more than one good:

       (a)    aggregate evaluation: no less than 80 percent of the total 
              bid price must consist of Canadian goods; or,

       (b)    item by item evaluation: in some cases, the bid evaluation 
              may be conducted on an item-by-item basis and contracts may 
              be awarded to more than one supplier. In these cases, 
              suppliers will be asked to identify separately each item that 
              meets the definition of Canadian goods.

4.     <strong>Variety of services</strong>: For requirements consisting of more than one 
       service, a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price must be 
       provided by personnel based in Canada.

5.     <strong>Mix of goods and services</strong>: When requirements consist of a mix of 
       goods and services, no less than 80 percent of the total bid price 
       must consist of Canadian goods and services (as defined above).

6.     Annex 7.8 of the<em> Supply Manual</em> (<strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/acquisitions/
       text/sm/chapter07-e.html#annex7.8</strong>) shows how Canadian content is 
       determined for a mix of goods, a mix of services or a mix of goods 
       and services.

7.     Other Canadian goods and services:

       (a)    <strong>CIRCLE Canada and MERIT Partnership Program</strong>: For photocopiers, 
              computers and office equipment within FSC groups 36, 70 and 
              74, only the products of the following firms are considered 
              Canadian goods:

                     [IC] and Public Works and Government Services Canada

              (ii)   Companies which, on March 31, 1992, were allocated to
