<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The price(s) in Canadian funds include(s) foreign currency 
       component(s) in respect of goods and/or services originating outside 
       Canada as detailed on form DSS-MAS 9411, entitled Claim for Exchange 
       Rate Adjustments, which is attached hereto and forms part of this 
       Contract.  In the event that one or more of the milestones involve a 
       foreign currency component which becomes due and payable on that 
       particular milestone, a separate form DSS-MAS 9411 shall accompany 
       the invoice for each applicable milestone.

2.     Where a milestone payable includes the importation of goods into 
       Canada, the exchange rate used to calculate the exchange rate 
       adjustment shall be the rate applied by Canada Customs on the date 
       of importation.  For a milestone that does not involve the 
       importation of goods, but still includes a foreign currency 
       component, the exchange rate used to calculate the exchange rate 
       adjustment shall be the Bank of Canada noon-day exchange rate in 
       effect on the date when the milestone became due and payable. 

3.     No price adjustment directly resulting from the provisions contained 
       in this clause will be applied for increases or decreases in the 
       exchange rate factor within a variation of:  plus or minus 2 percent 
       of the aforementioned exchange rate(s); or plus or minus $100 of the 
       total cumulative amount claimed for exchange rate adjustment under 
       the Contract.       

4.     On each invoice (or milestone claim form) submitted against the 
       Contract, the Contractor will show the exchange rate adjustment 
       amount (either upward, downward or no change) as a separate item on 
       the invoice or milestone payment claim form.  In the event of 
       delivery, the invoice (or milestone payment claim form) shall be 
       accompanied by a copy of the applicable Canada Customs import entry 
       form.  Where the items have not been imported, the Contractor must 
       show evidence, satisfactory to the Minister, that the amount claimed 
       is due and payable in foreign funds by the Contractor. 

5.     The Minister shall have the right to audit any revision to costs and 
       prices under this clause.
