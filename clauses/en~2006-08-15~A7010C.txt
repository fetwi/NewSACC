<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Unless otherwise authorized by the responsible Commodity Team, use the following 
clause in multi-departmental supply arrangements when more than one department 
is identified as a user of the supply arrangement.  The supply arrangement 
authority must attach a list of the data to be reported on by the supplier as an 
annex to the supply arrangement.  The Value Management Office, Acquisition 
Renewal Sector, requires as a minimum the data elements that are detailed within 
the business volume report made available at the Standing Offer Index 
(http://soi.pwgsc.gc.ca).

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Supplier must compile and maintain records on its provision of goods, 
services or both to the federal government under contracts resulting from 
the Supply Arrangement.  This data must include all purchases ordered, 
including purchases paid for by a Government of Canada Acquisition Card.  
The data must be aggregated and submitted on a quarterly basis to the 
Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Supply Arrangement 
Authority responsible for the Supply Arrangement.  The reported data must 
include the data shown at Annex "_____."

Quarterly periods are defined as follows: 

1st quarter: April 1, to June 30;
2nd quarter: July 1 to September 30;
3rd quarter: October 1 to December 31;
4th quarter: January 1 to March 31.

The reporting cut-off date for each quarter is the last Friday of the third 
calendar month of the quarter. Goods, services or both provided in the 
period after that day must be included in the next quarter's report. 
Electronic reports must be completed and forwarded to the PWGSC Supply 
Arrangement Authority no later than 15 calendar days after the end of the 
quarterly period.

All data fields of the report must be completed as requested.  If some data 
is not available, the reason must be indicated in the report.  If no goods 
or services are provided during a given period, the Supplier must still 
provide a "NIL" report.

Failure to provide fully completed quarterly reports in accordance with the 
above instructions may result in the withdrawal by Canada from the Supply 
Arrangement, the removal of the Supplier from the suppliers' list and the 
application of a vendor performance corrective measure.
