                     Subcontractor</strong>

12.1   The Contractor shall ensure that all its lawful obligations and any 
       lawful claims against the Contractor arising out of the performance 
       of the <em>work</em> are discharged and satisfied at least as often as the

       Contractor.  The Contractor shall provide the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> 
       with a Statutory Declaration deposing to the existence and condition 
       of such claims and obligations when called upon to do so.

12.2   Her Majesty may, in order to discharge lawful obligations of and

       Contractor would have been obliged to pay to such claimant had the 
       provisions of the Provincial or Territorial lien legislation, or in 
       the province of Quebec, the law relating to privileges, been 
       applicable to the <em>work</em>.  Any such claimant need not comply with the 
       provisions of such legislation setting out the steps by way of

              signed by the Contractor authorizing payment of the said 
              claim or claims. 
12.5   A payment made pursuant to GC 12.2 is, to the extent of the payment, 
       a discharge of Her Majesty's liability to the Contractor under the 
       contract and may be deducted from any amount payable to the 
       Contractor under the contract.

12.6   GC 12.2 shall only apply to claims and obligations:

       12.6.1 The notification of which has set forth the amount claimed to 
              be owing and the person who by contract is primarily liable.  
              The notification must be received by the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> 
              in writing before final payment is made to the Contractor and 
              within 120 days of the date on which the claimant;

              12.6.1.1      should have been paid in full under the 
                            claimant's contract with the Contractor or 
                            subcontractor where the claim is for money that 
                            was lawfully required to be held back from the 
                            claimant; or

              12.6.1.2      performed the last of the services, <em>work</em> or 
                            labour, or furnished the last of the material 
                            pursuant to the claimant's contract with the 
                            Contractor or subcontractor where the claim is 
                            not for money referred to in GC 12.6.1.1, and

       12.6.2 The proceedings to determine the right to payment of the 
              claim shall have commenced within one year from the date that 
              the notice referred to in GC 12.6.1 was received by the <em>
              Architect/Engineer</em>.

12.7   Her Majesty may, upon receipt of a notification of claim referred to 
       in GC 12.6.1, withhold from any amount that is due and payable to 
       the Contractor pursuant to the contract the full amount of the claim 
       or any portion thereof.

12.8   The <em>Architect/Engineer</em> shall notify the Contractor in writing of 
       receipt of any notification of claim and of the intention of Her 
       Majesty to withhold funds pursuant to GC 12.7.  The Contractor may, 
       at any time thereafter and until payment is made to the claimant, 
       post with Her Majesty, security in a form acceptable to Her Majesty 
       in an amount equal to the value of the said claim.  Upon receipt of 
       such security Her Majesty shall release to the Contractor any funds 
       which would be otherwise payable to the Contractor, that were 
       withheld pursuant to the provisions of GC 12.7.

<strong>GC 13  (25/05/01)    Architect/Engineer's Rights and Obligations</strong>

13.1   The <em>Architect/Engineer</em> shall:

       13.1.1 have access to the<em> work</em> at all times during its execution and 
              the Contractor will provide the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> with full 
              information and assistance in order that he may ensure that 
              the <em>work</em> is executed in accordance with the contract.

       13.1.2 decide any question as to whether anything has been done as 
              required by the contract or as to what the Contractor is 
              required by the contract to do, including questions as to the 
              acceptability of the quality or quantity of any labour, plant 
              or material used in the execution of the <em>work</em> and the timing 
              and scheduling of the various phases of the <em>work</em>.

              change the whole or any part of the <em>work</em> provided for in the 
              plans and specifications.  The <em>Architect/Engineer</em> shall 
              decide whether anything done or not done as a result of 
              directions given under this subsection has increased or 
              decreased the cost of the <em>work</em> to the Contractor and the 
              amount payable under the contract to the Contractor will be 
              increased or decreased accordingly by an amount calculated in 
              accordance with GC 19 hereof. 
13.2   The Contractor shall comply with any decision or direction of the <em>
       Architect/Engineer</em> given under this section.

<strong>GC 14  (16/02/98)    Delay, Non-Compliance or Default by the Contractor</strong>

14.1   If the Contractor delays in the commencement, execution or 
       completion of the <em>work</em>, fails to comply with a direction or decision 
       of the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> properly give, or is in default in any 
       other manner under the contract, the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> may do such 
       things as he deems necessary to correct the Contractor's default.  
       The Contractor will reimburse Her Majesty for all costs, expenses 
       and damage incurred or sustained by Her Majesty, by reason of the 
       Contractor's default, or in correcting the default.  In addition to 
       the aforementioned remedies in this section, the <em>Minister</em> may, if 
       the default continues for 6 days after notice in writing of default 
       has been given to the Contractor by the <em>Architect/Engineer</em>, 
       terminate the contract in accordance with GC 17.3.

<strong>GC 15  (25/05/01)    Changes in Soil Conditions, Delay by Her Majesty, etc.</strong>

15.1   No extra payment will be made to the Contractor for any extra 
       expense, loss or damage for any reason unless the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> 
       shall certify that such extra expense, loss or damage is directly 
       attributable to:

       15.1.1 a substantial difference between the soil conditions at the 
              site of the <em>work</em> indicated by the plans and specifications 
              and the actual soil conditions found there;

       15.1.2 neglect or delay by Her Majesty, occurring after the date of 
              contract, in providing any information or doing any act which 
              is required expressly by the contract or by usage of the 
              trade, or suspension of the<em> work</em> by the <em>Minister</em>;

       and the Contractor has within 30 days of encountering such soil 
       conditions or of the commencement of such neglect or delay, given 
       written notice to the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> of a claim for such extra 
       expense, loss or damage.  The amount of any extra payment to be made 
       under this Section will be calculated in accordance with GC 19.

15.2   If in the opinion of the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> any difference in soil 
       conditions referred to in GC 15.1.1 hereto results in a saving of 
       expenditure to the Contractor the amount of such saving shall be 
       paid to Her Majesty by the Contractor.

<strong>GC 16  (16/02/98)    Protesting Architect/Engineer's Decision</strong>

16.1   If the Contractor, within 10 days of receiving any decision or 
       direction of the <em>Architect/Engineer</em>, gives written notice to the <em>
       Architect/Engineer</em> that the decision or direction is accepted under 
       protest, Her Majesty will pay to the Contractor the cost, calculated 
       according to GC19, of anything that the Contractor was required to 
       do, as a result of the decision or direction, beyond what the 
       contract correctly understood would have required him to do.

<strong>GC 17  (16/02/98)    Suspension or Termination of the Contract</strong>

17.1   The <em>Minister</em> may upon notice in writing to the Contractor suspend or 
       terminate the contract at any time.  The Contractor will comply with 
       such notice immediately.

17.2   If the <em>Minister</em> suspends the <em>work</em> for 30 days or less the Contractor 
       must, subject to his remedy under GC 15 hereof, complete the <em>work</em> 
       when called upon to do so.  If the <em>Minister</em> suspends the <em>work</em> for a 
       period in excess of 30 days the Contractor may request the <em>Minister</em> 
       to terminate the <em>work</em> under GC 17.4 hereof.
 
17.3   If the <em>Minister</em> terminates the contract because of default by the 
       Contractor, the insolvency of or the commission of an act of 
       bankruptcy by the Contractor, the obligation of Her Majesty to make 
       payments to the Contractor shall cease and no further payments shall 
       be made to the Contractor unless the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> shall 
       certify that no financial prejudice will result to Her Majesty from 
       such further payments.  Termination under this subsection shall not 
       relieve the Contractor of any legal or contractual obligations other 
       than the physical completion of the <em>work</em>.  In such circumstances the <em>
       Architect/Engineer</em> may complete or have the <em>work</em> completed as he 
       sees fit and all costs and damages incurred by Her Majesty due to 
       the non-completion of the <em>work</em> by the Contractor shall be payable by 
       the Contractor to Her Majesty.

17.4   If the <em>Minister</em> terminates the <em>work</em> other than in accordance with GC 
       17.3 hereof Her Majesty will pay to the Contractor an amount 
       calculated in accordance with GC 19 hereof subject to any additions 
       or deductions otherwise provided by the General Conditions or Labour 
       Conditions less any payments made pursuant to GC 25.3 hereof.  In no 
       event, however, shall such amount be greater than the amount which 
       would have been payable to the Contractor had the contract been 
       completed.

<strong>GC 18  (16/02/98)    No Additional Payments</strong>

18.1   The amount payable to the Contractor under this contract will not be 
       increased or decreased by reason of any increase or decrease in the 
       cost of the <em>work</em> brought about by any increase in the cost of plant, 
       labour or material, except that, in the event of a change in any tax, 
       that affects the cost of any materials incorporated in or to be 
       incorporated in the <em>work</em>, imposed under the <em>Excise Act</em>, the <em>Excise 
       Tax Act</em>, the <em>Old Age Security Act</em>, the <em>Customs Act</em> or <em>Customs Tariff</em>, 
       made public after the date of the submission of the tender, an 
       appropriate adjustment may be made.

<strong>GC 19  (25/05/01)    Determination of Costs</strong>

19.1   For the purposes of GC11, GC13.3, GC15, GC16, and GC17.4 and subject 
       to the provisions of GC 25.2.2, the amount payable to the Contractor 
       for any change in the scope of work requested by the <em>Architect/
       Engineer </em>shall be based on the Unit Prices as set out in Clause 4 of 
       the Tender and Acceptance.

19.2   If the Unit Prices referred to in GC19.1 cannot be used to determine 
       the amount payable to the Contractor due to a change in the scope of 
       the work, then the Contractor shall submit to the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> 
       a quotation of the Contractor's costs for all labour, plant and 
       material required by the change.  The Contractor shall include a 
       mark-up in an amount equal to 20% of its costs for the labour, plant 
       and material portion of the work to be done by its own forces and an 
       additional mark-up in an amount equal to 15% of all quotations 
       received from its subcontractors.  The Contractor shall ensure that 
       its subcontractor shall include a mark-up in an amount equal to 20% 
       of its costs for the labour, plant and material portion of the work 
       to be done by the subcontractors own forces and an additional 
       mark-up in an amount equal to 15% of all quotations received from 
       its sub-subcontractors.  The mark-ups referred to herein shall be 
       considered full compensation for all supervision, coordination, 
       administration, overhead, margin, finance and interest charges, and 
       the risk of undertaking the work within a stipulated amount.  The 
       Contractor's and subcontractors' costs shall be inclusive of all 
       contractor and trade discounts.  Quotations referred to herein shall 
       be prepared and submitted in accordance with the appropriate 
       percentage mark-up as described elsewhere in the Contract.

19.3   If the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> and the Contractor fail to reach agreement 
       on the prices quoted in GC 19.2, then the amount payable to the 
       Contractor shall be all reasonable and proper costs paid or legally 
       payable by the Contractor that are directly attributable to the 
       change in the scope of the work plus an additional amount equal to 
       10% of such costs to cover overhead, finance and interest charges, 
       and margin.  The Contractor shall provide evidence of such costs to 
       the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> with its progress claim or invoice.

<strong>GC 20  (16/02/98)    Records to be Kept</strong>

20.1   The Contractor shall for a period of two years from the date of the 
       Final Certificate of Completion, maintain and keep full records, 
       vouchers, other writings and information in respect of his estimates 
       and actual cost of the <em>work</em> and shall make them available for copy, 
       audit or inspection by any persons acting on behalf of the <em>Minister</em>.

21.1   The <em>Minister</em> may, on the application of the Contractor made before 
       the day fixed for the completion of the <em>work</em>, extend the time for 
       the completion of the <em>work</em>.  Whether or not the <em>Minister</em> grants an 
       extension, the Contractor shall, except to the extent that the <em>
       Minister</em> is of the opinion that the need for an extension was due to 
       causes beyond the control of the Contractor, pay to Her Majesty.

       21.1.1 an amount equal to Departmental inspection costs relating to

              quantities.  Where the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> and the Contractor

       Engineer</em> his Statutory Declaration pursuant to GC 12 the amount of 
       the Progress Claim, subject to GC 25.3 of this section, shall become 
       due and payable.

25.6   Notwithstanding GC 25.3, 25.4 and 25.5 above, an amount shall be due 
       and payable to the Contractor only if the Contractor has supplied a 
       Statutory Declaration pursuant to GC 12 of the General Conditions.  
       The amount referred to above shall be due and payable as indicated

              Majesty shall pay the Contractor simple interest on any

              the Contractor without demand, except that, in respect of

              unless the Contractor so demands after such amounts have 
              become due.

              the Bank Rate in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
