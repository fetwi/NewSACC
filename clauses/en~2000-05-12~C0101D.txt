<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The estimated amount of profit included in the Contractor's price or rate 
certification is subject to verification by government audit, at Canada's 
discretion, before or after payment is made to the Contractor under the 
terms and conditions of the Contract.  The purpose of such audit would be 
to determine whether the actual profit earned on a single contract if only 
one exists, or the aggregate of actual profit earned by the Contractor on a 
series of negotiated firm price and fixed-time rate contracts received 
during a particular period selected, is fair and reasonable based on the 
estimated amount of profit included in earlier price or rate certification(
s).  If the said audit demonstrates that actual profit is not fair and 
reasonable, as defined above, it is agreed that the Contractor shall repay 
Canada the amount found to be in excess of a fair and reasonable profit.
