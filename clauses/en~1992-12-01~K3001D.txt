<pre>(1)    In the Contract:

       (a)    "<strong>Background Intellectual Property</strong>" means all Technical  
              Information that is not Foreground Intellectual Property and 
              that is proprietary to the Contractor, its subcontractors or 
              any other supplier of the Contractor;

       (b)    "<strong>Foreground Intellectual Property</strong>" means any Invention first 
              conceived, developed or reduced to practice as part of the 
              Work under the Contract and all Technical Information 
              collected, developed or produced as part of the Work under 
              the Contract;

       (c)    "<strong>Invention</strong>" means any new and useful art, process, 
              methodology, technique, machine, manufacture or composition 
              of matter, or any new and useful improvement of any art, 
              process, methodology, technique, machine, manufacture or

       (d)    "<strong>Other Contractor</strong>" means any contractor to which Canada 
              sublicenses the use of Foreground Intellectual Property for 
              purposes of carrying out a contract with Canada; and

       (e)    "<strong>Technical Information</strong>" means all information of a scientific 
              or technical nature relating to the Work, whether oral or 
              recorded in any form or medium and whether or not 
              copyrightable, including but not limited to Inventions, 
              designs, methods, processes, techniques, know-how, reports, 
              drawings, plans, specifications, photographs, models, 
              prototypes, patterns, samples, schematics, experimental or 
              test data, and computer software, source code, data files, 
              and documentation.

(2)    The Contractor shall promptly report and fully disclose to the 
       Minister the conception, development or reduction to practice of any 
       Invention that could be Foreground Intellectual Property, and shall 
       report and fully disclose to the Minister all other Foreground 
       Intellectual Property at a time selected by the Contractor, but not 
       later than the completion of the Work or such other time as the 
       Minister or the Contract may require.  The Contractor shall, in each 
       disclosure under this subsection, indicate the name of any 
       subcontractor at any tier in which title to any of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property has vested or will vest.

(3)    Except as otherwise specified in the Contract and subject to 
       subsection (7), copyright, patent and all other proprietary rights 
       to all Foreground Intellectual Property shall, immediately upon its 
       conception, development, reduction to practice or production, vest 
       in and remain the property of the Contractor.  
 
(4)    Notwithstanding the Contractor's ownership of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property in any prototype or any custom machinery, 
       device, system or equipment delivered under the Contract, Canada 
       shall have unrestricted ownership rights in the thing delivered, 
       including the right to sell it and to make it available for public 
       use whether for a fee or otherwise.

(5)    The Contractor hereby grants to Canada, in relation to all of the 
       Foreground Intellectual Property, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, 
       world-wide, fully paid and royalty-free licence to use or have used, 
       make or have made, copy, translate, practise or produce the 
       intellectual property, for any government purpose except commercial 
       sale in competition with the Contractor.  In relation to any 
       Foreground Intellectual property that consists of software, source 
       code and related documentation, the Contractor agrees that the 
       foregoing licence includes the right to modify that intellectual 
       property and, where applicable, to use it, or any modified version 
       of it, on any and all computer systems owned, leased or operated by 
       Canada anywhere in the world.  The Contractor acknowledges that 
       Canada may wish to award competitively contracts related to the use 
       of the Work under this Contract or for the further development of 
       the Work or the Foreground Intellectual Property, and the Contractor 
       agrees that Canada's licence to the use of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property includes the right to sublicense the use of 
       that intellectual property to any Other Contractor engaged by Canada.  
       Any sublicence given by Canada to an Other Contractor shall 
       authorize use of the Foreground Intellectual Property solely for the 
       purpose of performing contracts for Canada, and shall require the 
       Other Contractor to maintain the confidentiality of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property.

(6)    Wherever practical, the Contractor shall mark or identify any 
       Foreground or Background Intellectual Property delivered to Canada 
       under this section as "Property of (Contractor name); permitted 
       Government uses defined under DSS Contract No. (fill in contract 
       number)", and Canada shall not be liable for any unauthorized use or 
       disclosure of Foreground or Background Intellectual Property that 
       could have been so marked or identified and was not.

(7)    Until the Contractor discloses Foreground Intellectual Property in 
       accordance with subsection (2), it shall not, without the prior 
       written permission of the Minister, assign or otherwise transfer 
       title to the Foreground Intellectual Property or license or 
       otherwise authorize the use of that intellectual property by any 
       person.  If the Contractor fails to disclose any Foreground 
       Intellectual Property in accordance with subsection (2), or if the 
       Contract is terminated by Canada under the provisions of the 
       Contract relating to termination on the grounds of default by the 
       Contractor, the Minister may, within 90 days of notice to the 
       Contractor of the termination or of the time that Canada learns of 
       the Contractor's failure to so disclose or of the earlier of those 
       events, issue a notice to the Contractor whereupon copyright, patent 
       and all other proprietary rights to the Foreground Intellectual 
       Property not disclosed, or in the case of termination all of the 
       Foreground Intellectual Property, shall immediately vest in and 
       remain the property of Canada.  In that event the Contractor shall, 
       at its own expense, execute such conveyances or other documents 
       relating to title as the minister for whose department or agency the 
       Work is being carried out may require, and the Contractor shall, at 
       Canada's expense, afford that minister all reasonable assistance in 
       the prosecution of any patent application or registration of 
       copyright or an industrial design, including assistance of the 
       inventor in the case of Inventions.

(8)    Canada is prepared to license the use by the Contractor of 
       intellectual property owned by Canada and furnished to the 
       Contractor under this Contract for purposes of the commercial 
       exploitation or further development by the Contractor of the 
       Foreground Intellectual Property, on terms and conditions, which may 
       include the payment of compensation, to be negotiated between the 
       Contractor and the minister for whose department or agency the Work 
       is being carried out.

(9)    The Contractor shall not, without the written permission of the 
       Minister, incorporate into the Work any Background Intellectual 
       Property unless it owns or has procured the rights necessary to 
       provide the licence to Canada under subsection (5).
  
(10)   In any transfer of title to or assignment of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property or any licence for the use of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property, the Contractor shall impose on the other 
       party any obligations to Canada imposed under this Contract and any 
       restrictions on the use or disposition of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property contained in this Contract, including the 
       obligation to impose the same obligations and restrictions on any 
       subsequent transferee, assignee or licensee, so that such 
       obligations and restrictions will continue to apply to the current 
       holder of those rights to the Foreground Intellectual Property.  The 
       Contractor agrees that neither the Contractor nor any such current 
       holder of those rights to the Foreground Intellectual Property shall 
       have the right to collect a royalty or other compensation on the use 
       of the Foreground Intellectual Property for purposes of a contract 
       or other arrangement with Canada.  The Contractor or other current 
       holder of rights to the Foreground Intellectual Property shall 
       promptly notify Canada of the name, address and other pertinent 
       information in regard to any such transferee, assignee or licensee.

(11)   Before and after final payment to the Contractor, the Minister shall 
       have the right to examine all records and supporting data of  the 
       Contractor which the Minister reasonably deems pertinent to the 
       discovery or identification of Technical Information to which 
       subsection (2) applies.

(12)   The Contractor shall, upon the written request of the Minister, 
       furnish all logistical support and life-cycle support data relating 
       to the Work, including lists of suppliers, supplier part numbers and 
       related drawings, and shall do so at the minimum extra cost to 
       Canada.
