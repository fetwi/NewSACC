1.     This is a request (hereinafter referred to as a Request For Proposal 
or RFP) that proposals be developed and submitted to the Minister of Supply 
and Services setting out the alternative means by which several technical, 
performance, time and other goals and objectives may be best met, having 
regard to stated mandatory requirements.  The Minister will consider 
entering into contract for the implementation of the most acceptable 
proposal which will be determined having regard to the evaluation factors 
set out in this RFP.  In addition, the proposal will be measured against 
the contract terms and conditions set forth in this RFP.

2.     a)     To submit your offer, return signed original of the bid 
              solicitation document, duly completed.  Ensure that your 
              firm's name, Department of Supply and Services (DSS) file 
              number, solicitation closing date are clearly visible.  
              Electronically transmitted responses (telex, facsimile and 
              commercial telegram) will also be considered (except those 
              for the Science Branch) provided they are received prior to 
              the time specified for closing of proposals and contain the 
              DSS file number, solicitation closing time and date.  
              Electronically transmitted  proposals will constitute your 
              formal proposal. Such proposals must be comprehensive and in 
              sufficient detail so as to permit complete evaluation in 
              accordance with the criteria set out herein.  The Minister 
              may consider entering into contract without negotiation on 
              the basis of such electronically transmitted  proposals.

       b)     The bidder has the sole responsibility for the timely 
              dispatch and delivery of a bid and cannot transfer such 
              responsibility to the Crown.

3.     Municipal taxes are not applicable; for provincial taxes, see B.1 - 
Conditions below.

Unless otherwise specified by the Crown, all prices quoted shall be net 
prices in Canadian funds including Canadian customs duties and excise taxes, 
and are to be FOB, including all delivery charges to destination(s) as 
indicated.  The amount of the goods and services tax shall be shown as a 
separate item. 


4.     Proposals may be accepted in whole or in part and the lowest or any 
proposal will not necessarily be accepted.  In case of error in the 
extension of prices, the unit price will govern. Proposals will remain open 
for acceptance for a period of not less than sixty (60) days from closing 
date of this RFP, unless otherwise indicated herein by DSS.  All late 
proposals will be returned unopened. Proposals mailed at least forty-eight 
(48) hours prior to the closing time and date (ninety-six [96] hours 
outside Canada) and are delayed in the mail, will be considered, provided 
evidence of timely mailing is supported by certification of registered mail, 
special delivery or by postage cancellation. (Note: Postage meter imprints 
are not acceptable as proof of timely mailing.)

2.     If transportation charges are payable by Her Majesty under the terms 
of this contract, shipments are to be made by the most direct and 
economical means consistent with normal shipping practice, unless otherwise 
directed (as in the case when transportation costs are part of the unit 
price).  They are to be shown as a separate item on the invoice.

3.     Valuation:  The federal government's policy of underwriting its own 
risks precludes payment of any excess valuation and/or transportation 
charges beyond the specified FOB point (the point at which title of goods

maximum liability and value will be declared only when additional costs 
will not be incurred.
