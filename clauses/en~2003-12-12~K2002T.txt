<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Organizations that are subject to the Federal Contractors Program for 
Employment Equity (FCP-EE) but that have been declared ineligible to 
receive government contracts of goods and services over the threshold for 
solicitation of bids as set out in the <em>Government Contract Regulations</em> 
(GCRs) (currently $25,000, including all applicable taxes) by Human 
Resources Development Canada-Labour (HRDC-Labour), either as a result of a 
finding of non-compliance by HRDC-Labour, or following their voluntary 
withdrawal from the FCP-EE for a reason other than a reduction in their 
workforce, have been advised by HRDC-Labour that as a consequence of this 
action they are no longer eligible to receive any government contract over 
this threshold.  Consequently, their certificate numbers have been 
cancelled and their names have been placed on HRDC-Labour's List of 
Ineligible Contractors.  Bids from such organizations will be considered 
non-responsive.

The Bidder certifies that it has not been declared "ineligible" by 
HRDC-Labour to receive government contracts over the GCRs threshold for 
solicitation of bids (currently $25,000, including all applicable taxes) as 
a result of a finding of non-compliance, or as a result of having 
voluntarily withdrawn from the FCP-EE for a reason other than a reduction 
in their workforce.

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister shall rely on this certification 
to award the Contract.  Should a verification by the Minister disclose a 
misrepresentation on the part of the Bidder, the Minister shall have the 
right to treat any contract resulting from this bid as being in default, 
and to terminate it pursuant to the Default provisions of the Contract.
