<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must collect a sample from the first
batch of each of the items that will be supplied under the
Contract. The sample must consist of a group of items or portion of
products of sufficient size to conduct the testing required. The
Contractor must split the sample into two equal portions. One
portion must be tested by the Contractor's test facility. The other
portion must be tested by a facility meeting one of the following
criteria:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">an independent, arms length third party laboratory
accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (or other nationally
or internationally recognized laboratory accrediting body) to
conduct the tests identified in the item specification(s) or</li>
<li value="2">an independent, arms length third party laboratory
operating a <cite><abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 17025:2005</cite> system, and participating regularly in a
recognized proficiency testing program for the contracted
product(s).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Each portion must be tested to all requirements
detailed in the item specification(s). The Contractor does not have
to conduct tests identified by the specification(s) as
qualification tests only. The Contractor does not have to conduct a
test on the first batch of items if the above program for sampling
and testing has been conducted within six (6) months of the date of
the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor must, on receipt of the third party
test report, compare the results received with those of the
Contractor's own test facility. Any deviation between results
obtained by the two test facilities in excess of the
reproducibility of the test methods involved, must be investigated,
the root cause determined and corrective action taken.</li>
<li value="4">The Contractor must repeat the above program for
sampling and testing at least once every six (6) months during the
life of the Contract.</li>
<li value="5">The purpose of this correlation testing is to verify
the quality of the contracted item(s) and to validate the
capability of the Contractor's testing facility. The test report(s)
received from the third party laboratory, the Contractor's test
reports for the same batch(es) of contracted item(s), reports of
any investigations of deviations of the results obtained by the two
laboratories and any corrective actions taken, must be made
available to the Quality Assurance Representative on request. Test
validation must be conducted at Contractor's expense.</li>
