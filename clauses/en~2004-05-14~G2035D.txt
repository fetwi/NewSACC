<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>(a)    Litigation Rights:  Consistent with subsection 5(d) of the <em>
       Department of Justice Act</em>, R.S.C. 1993, c. J-2, s.1, it is 
       understood and agreed that where any suit is instituted for or 
       against Canada which the Insurer or Insurers would, but for this 
       clause, have the right to pursue or defend on behalf of Canada as an 
       Additional Insured under this insurance policy, the Insurer shall 
       promptly contact the Attorney General of Canada to agree on the 
       legal strategies by sending a registered letter, or by courier with 
       an acknowledgement of receipt,

       for the province of Quebec, to:

       Director
       Business Law Directorate
       Quebec Regional Office (Ottawa)
       Department of Justice
       284 Wellington Street, Room SAT-6042
       Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

              and

       for all other provinces and territories, to:

       Senior General Counsel
       Civil Litigation Section
       Department of Justice
       234 Wellington Street, East Tower
       Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

       The notification must be followed, within a reasonable period, by an 
       information copy to the Contracting Authority.

       The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right to co-defend 
       any action brought against Canada.  However, all expenses incurred 
       by Canada to co-defend such actions would be at Canada's expense.  
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Canada decides to co-defend any 
       action brought against it, and Canada will not agree to a proposed 
       settlement documented and agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and 
       the plaintiff(s) that would result in the settlement or dismissal of 
       the action as against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the 
       Contractor's insurer for any difference between the proposed amount 
       for which the action as against Canada would have been settled and 
       the amount finally awarded or paid to the plaintiffs (inclusive of 
       costs and interest) on behalf of Canada.

(b)    Additional Named Insured:  Canada is included as an Additional Named 
       Insured, but only with respect to liabilities that may arise from 
       the Contractor's own negligence in the performance of the Contract.

(c)    Hangarkeeper's Liability:  Covering damages arising where storage of 
       aircraft for or on behalf of the insured in airport premises, owned 
       or leased by the Contractor; is a contract requirement.

(d)    Products and Completed Operations (24 months):  While not limited to, 
       the Broad Form endorsement should include service, assembly and 
       repair activities as well as material, parts or equipment furnished 
       in connection with the work performed by the Contractor or on its 
       behalf.

(e)    Airport Tenants' Legal Liability Broad Form:  To protect the 
       Contractor for liabilities arising by its occupancy of leased 
       airport premises.

(f)    Aviation Passenger Liability and inclusive Medical Payments:  If 
       sub-limits are applicable to Contractor's policy conforming to 
       international carriage agreements or otherwise, such sub-limits 
       shall in any event be, not less than, $50,000 per person, $500,000 
       per accident. 
 
(g)    Non-Owned Aircraft Liability:  To protect the Contractor for 
       liabilities arising by its use of aircrafts owned by other parties 
       including Canada.

(h)    Control Tower Liability:  To provide coverage for all liabilities 
       arising from the ownership and/or operations of air traffic control 
       towers.
