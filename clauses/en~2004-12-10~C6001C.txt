<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Canada's total liability under this Contract shall not exceed $ _______, 
       Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax extra, as applicable.

2.     No increase in the total liability of Canada or in the price of the 
       Work resulting from any design changes, modifications or 
       interpretations of specifications, will be authorized or paid to the 
       Contractor unless such changes, modifications or interpretations 
       have been approved, in writing, by the Contracting Authority, prior 
       to their incorporation in the Work. The Contractor shall not be 
       obliged to perform any work or provide any service that would cause 
       the total liability of Canada to be exceeded without the prior 
       written approval of the Contracting Authority.  The Contractor shall 
       notify the Contracting Authority in writing as to the adequacy of 
       this sum when: 

       (a)    it is 75 percent committed, or 

       (b)    four (4) months prior to the Contract expiry date, or 

       (c)    if the Contractor considers the funds provided are inadequate 
              for the completion of the Work,

              whichever comes first.

3.     In the event that the notification refers to inadequate funds, the 
       Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Authority, in writing, 
       an estimate for the additional funds required.  Provision of such 
       notification and estimate for the additional funds does not increase 
       Canada's liability.
