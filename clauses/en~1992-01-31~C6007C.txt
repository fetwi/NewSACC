<pre>Her Majesty's liability to the Carrier under this contract shall not exceed $ _____ 
   unless otherwise authorized in writing by this Department. The carrier 
   shall not be obliged to perform any work or provide any services which 
   would cause the total liability of her Majesty to exceed the sum, unless 
   an increase is so authorized by this Department as to the adequacy of 
   this sum when it is 75% committed, or four months prior to the estimated 
   date of completion of the contract, whichever comes first. However, if 
   at any time the Carrier considers that the said sum may be exceeded, the 
   Carrier will promptly notify this Department.    No increase in the 
   total liability of her Majesty or in the price of the work or services 
   resulting from any design changes, modifications or interpretations of 
   the specifications, will be authorized or paid to the carrier unless 
   such design changes, modifications or interpretations shall have been 
   approved by this Department prior to their incorporation into the work.
