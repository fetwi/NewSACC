       Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) <em>Manual</em>, by reference, into 
       procurement documents issued by the Department.

<strong>STRUCTURE</strong>

7.     The Manual has been organized to follow the progression of 
       information presented in procurement documents: 

<strong>Section 1 - Standard Instructions and Conditions</strong>

8.     Previously printed on the reverse of page 1 of solicitations and 
       contracts, or included as attachments, these instructions and 
       conditions are now identified in standard clause A0000D at the 
       beginning of the clause section in procurement documents.

<strong>Section 2 - Forms</strong> 
9.     This section contains forms commonly used in the procurement process. 
       Forms included are:

       (a)    Federal Contractors Program on Employment Equity - includes a 
              description of the program and Certificate of Commitment.

       (b)    Security Requirements Check List.

       (c)    Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments - DSS-MAS 9411.

       (d)    Information on Incumbent Employees

       The reader is directed to the specific clauses and/or conditions 
       which may be referred to in a procurement document. In certain cases, 
       the applicable certificates or forms have been reproduced for the 
       perusal and/or use of the reader.

<strong>Sections 3 and 4 - General Conditions and Supplemental General Conditions</strong>

10.    These sections present those sets of standard conditions which form 
       the foundation upon which all procurement documents issued by PWGSC 
       are built. Section 3 defines the basic sets of conditions which 
       apply to specific classes of contracts (e.g. DSS-MAS 9329 - General 
       Conditions - Purchase of Commercially Available Off-the-shelf Goods 
       and Services). Section 4, Supplemental General Conditions, addresses 
       areas unique to specific sub-classes of contracts (e.g. DSS-MAS 1028 
       - Supplemental General Conditions - Ship Construction - Firm Price).

11.    Each section/article within a condition set has been given its own 
       effective date. The condition set as a whole has also been given an 
       effective date which is reflected in section 00 and is determined by 
       the latest revision date of one or more of its sections.

<strong>Section 5 - Standard Procurement Clauses</strong>

12.    This section contains a collection of national procurement clauses, 
       common to various classes of contracts. The full text of individual 
       clauses, incorporated by reference into a bid solicitation or 
       contract by their Number, Title and Effective Date, can be found in 
       this section of the Manual. Each subsection (A-Z) is devoted to a 
       particular subject area. Please note that some subsections have not 
       been assigned at this time.

13.    Clauses may be identified by their numbers which break down as 
       follows:

       (a)    the first alphabetic character (A-Z) indicates the subsection 
              in Section 5; 
       (b)    the four numeric characters (0000-9999) indicate the clause's 
              position within the numeric sequence of the subsection;

       (c)    the final alphabetic character (T, C or D) indicates the type 
              of document in which a given clause would be used (i.e. T = 
              Tender; C = Contract; D = Dual purpose, used in both tenders 
              and contracts).

       Example:      Clause C0004T - Price Certification. This is the 
                     fourth sequential clause found in subsection C - Price, 
                     of Section 5 and is used in Tender (solicitation) 
                     documents.

<strong>Section 6 - Indexes</strong>

14.    <strong>Print Version (Index)</strong> - This section provides an alphabetic and a 
       numeric index of national clauses. To further assist users during 
       the introductory period for the Manual, a second numeric index by "
       old" clause numbers cross-referencing to "new" clause numbers has 
       been provided.

       <strong>Smartext Version (Synopsis)</strong> - A synopsis of the changes made since 
       the last release is provided for each section. It can be accessed 
       through the "Outline Window".

<strong>USE OF THE MANUAL</strong>

<strong>Reference clauses</strong>

15.    Bid solicitations and contracts will contain references to specific 
       clauses and general conditions which will apply to that particular 
       requirement. Clause references will include the clause number, its 
       effective date and its title (e.g. A0001T (06/91) Survey of 
       Facilities). All clauses referred to in this manner can be found in 
       Section 5 of this Manual.

<strong>Fill-in clauses</strong>

16.    Clauses which require the insertion of specific information by the 
       procurement officer or the supplier (fill-in clauses) will be 
       produced in full on procurement documents.

       <strong>NOTE</strong>:  In the case of discrepancies in clause versions between 
                     solicitation documents and the Manual, any clause 
                     appearing in full text in a procurement document will 
                     override any version set out in the SACC Manual.

<strong>Updates</strong>

17.    Any standard clause, and any condition or instruction set, used or 
       referenced in a bid solicitation or contract may be updated from 
       time to time.  When this happens, the version used in an 
       already-issued document will remain in effect in that document, 
       unless the updated version is legally incorporated.

<strong>Amendments</strong> 
18.    The Manual will be amended from time to time, as required. In most 
       instances, this will mean replacing individual pages while in others, 
       whole sections or subsections may require replacement. PWGSC will 
       provide a synopsis for each amendment, identifying what has been 
       changed. Users are urged to read these amendments immediately and 
       register these updates on the Record of Amendments page at the 
       beginning of the Manual.
