<strong>1034   12     (13/12/99)    Changes in Soil Conditions and Neglect or Delay 
                            by Canada</strong>

1.     No payment will be made by <em>Canada</em> to the Contractor in addition to 
       the payment expressly promised by the <em>Contract</em> on account of any 
       extra expense, loss or damage incurred or sustained by the 
       Contractor for any reason including a misunderstanding on the part 
       of the Contractor as to any fact, whether or not such 
       misunderstanding is attributable directly or indirectly to <em>Canada</em> or 
       any of <em>Canada</em>'s agents or servants (whether or not any negligence or 
       fraud on the part of <em>Canada</em>'s agents or servants is involved) unless, 
       in the opinion of the <em>Engineer</em>, the extra expense, loss or damage is 
       directly attributable to

       (a)    a substantial difference between information relating to soil 
              conditions at the rise of the <em>Work</em>, or a reasonable 
              assumption of fact based thereon, in the Plans and 
              Specifications or other documents or <em>material</em> communicated by <em>
              Canada</em> to the Contractor for his use in preparing his tender 
              and the real soil conditions encountered at the site of the <em>
              Work</em> by the Contractor when executing the <em>Work</em>; or

       (b)    neglect or delay occurring after the date of the <em>Contract</em> on 
              the part of <em>Canada</em> in providing any information or in doing 
              any act which the <em>Contract</em> either expressly requires <em>Canada</em> 
              to do or which would be done by an owner, in accordance with 
              the usage of the trade, to enable his Contractor to carry out 
              an undertaking similar to the <em>Work</em> being executed under the <em>
              Contract</em> for <em>Canada</em>,

       in which case, if the Contractor has given to the <em>Engineer</em> written 
       notice of his claim before the expiration of thirty days from the 
       encountering of the soil conditions giving rise to the claim or from 
       the day on which the neglect occurs or the delay commences, as the 
       case may be, <em>Canada</em> will pay to the Contractor in respect of the 
       additional expense, loss or damage incurred or sustained by reason 
       of that difference, neglect or delay, an amount equal to the cost, 
       calculated in accordance with sections 44 to 47 of these General 
       Conditions, of the additional <em>plant</em>, labour and materials 
       necessarily involved.

2.     If, in the opinion of the <em>Engineer</em>, the Contractor has effected a 
       saving of expenditure by reason of the execution of the <em>Work</em> by the 
       Contractor being rendered less difficult and less costly because the 
       soil conditions actually encountered by the Contractor at the site 
       of the <em>Work</em> when executing the <em>Work</em> are substantially different from 
       soil conditions indicated in information or a reasonable assumption 
       of fact based thereon in the Plans and Specifications or other 
       documents or <em>material</em> communicated by <em>Canada</em> to the Contractor for 
       his use in preparing his tender, the amount set out in the <em>Contract</em> 
       shall be reduced by an amount equal to the saving effected by the 
       Contractor.

3.     Paragraph (a) of subsection 1 and subsection 2 are applicable only 
       to a fixed price arrangement.

4.     If information relating to soil conditions at the site of the <em>Work</em> 
       appeared in the Plans and Specifications or in other documents or <em>
       material</em> communicated by <em>Canada</em> to the Contractor for his use in 
       preparing his tender and if the real soil conditions encountered at 
       the site of the <em>Work</em> by the Contractor when executing the <em>Work</em> are 
       substantially different from such information, or a reasonable 
       assumption of fact based thereon, so that the cost to the Contractor 
       of executing the <em>Work</em> is directly and substantially increased or 
       decreased by reason of such difference, then the <em>Minister</em> and the 
       Contractor may, by agreement, amend the Unit Price Table so that the 
       benefit of a substantial decrease in cost shall accrue to <em>Canada</em> and 
       the burden of a substantial increase in cost will not be borne by 
       the Contractor.

5.     Subsection 4 is applicable only to a Unit Price Arrangement.


<strong>1034   13     (13/12/99)    Materials, Plant and Real Property Become 
                            Property of Canada</strong>

1.     All materials and <em>plant</em> and the interest of the Contractor in all 
       real property, licences, powers and privileges acquired, used or 
       provided by the Contractor for the <em>Work</em> shall, from the time of 
       being so acquired, used or provided, become and they are the 
       property of <em>Canada</em> for the purposes of the <em>Work</em> and they shall 
       continue to be the property of <em>Canada</em>

       (a)    in the case of materials, until incorporated in the <em>Work</em> or 
              until the <em>Engineer</em> indicates that he is satisfied that they 
              will not be required for the <em>Work</em>; and 
       (b)    in the case of <em>plant</em>, real property, licences, powers and 
              privileges, until the <em>Engineer</em> indicates that he is satisfied 
              that the interest vested in <em>Canada</em> therein is no longer 
              required for the purposes of the <em>Work</em>.

2.     <em>material</em> or <em>plant</em> that is the property of <em>Canada</em> by virtue of this 
       section shall not be taken away from the site of the <em>Work</em>, or used 
       or disposed of, except for the purposes of the <em>Work</em>, without the 
       consent in writing of the <em>Engineer</em>.

3.     <em>Canada</em> is not liable for loss or damage to <em>material</em> or <em>plant</em> that is 
       the property of <em>Canada</em> by virtue of this section and the Contractor 
       is liable for such loss or damage notwithstanding that the <em>material</em> 
       or <em>plant</em> is the property of <em>Canada</em>.


<strong>1034   14     (13/12/99)    Materials, Plant and Real Property Supplied by

1.     The Contractor is liable to <em>Canada</em> for loss or damage to <em>material</em>, <em>
       plant</em> or real property, whether attributable to causes beyond his 
       control or not, supplied or made available by <em>Canada</em> to the 
       Contractor for use in connection with the <em>Work</em> other than loss or 
       damage resulting from and directly attributable to reasonable wear 
       and tear.

2.     The Contractor will not use <em>material</em>, <em>plant</em> or real property to 
       which this section applies, except for the purpose of carrying out 
       this <em>Contract</em>.

3.     When the Contractor has failed, within a reasonable time after being 
       required by the <em>Engineer</em> to do so, to make good any loss or damage 
       for which he is liable under this section, the <em>Engineer</em> may cause 
       the loss or damage to be made good, and the Contractor shall 
       thereupon be liable to her Majesty for the cost thereof and shall, 
       on demand, pay to <em>Canada</em> an amount equal to such cost.

4.     The Contractor shall keep records of <em>material</em>, <em>plant</em> and real 
       property to which this section applies that the <em>Engineer</em> from time 
       to time requires and shall, from time to time as the <em>Engineer</em> 
       requires, satisfy the <em>Engineer</em> that such <em>material</em>, <em>plant</em> and real 
       property are at the place and in the condition that they ought to be.

5.     This section applies to <em>material</em>, <em>plant</em> and real property supplied 
       or made available by <em>Canada</em> to the Contractor for use in connection 
       with the <em>Work</em>.


<strong>1034   15     (13/12/99)    Extension of Time</strong>

1.     The <em>Minister</em> may, on the application of the Contractor made before 
       the day fixed by the <em>Contract</em> for completion of the <em>Work</em> or before 
       any new date for completion fixed under this subsection, if in his 
       opinion it is in the public interest, extend the time for completion 
       of the <em>Work</em> by fixing a new day for completion of the <em>Work</em>.

2.     Where the Contractor does not complete the <em>Work</em> by the day fixed by 
       the <em>Contract</em> for completion of the <em>Work</em> but does complete the <em>Work</em> 
       thereafter, the Contractor shall pay to <em>Canada</em>.

       (a)    an amount equal to all salaries, wages and travelling 
              expenses paid by <em>Canada</em> to persons superintending the <em>Work</em> 
              during the period of delay;

       (b)    an amount equal to the value to <em>Canada</em> of the use of the

       (c)    an amount equal to all other expenses and damages incurred or 
              sustained by <em>Canada</em> as a result of the <em>Work</em> not being 
              completed during the period of delay.
 
3.     For the purpose of this section,

       (a)    the <em>Work</em> shall be deemed to be completed on the day the <em>
              Engineer</em> issues his Interim Certificate of Completion; and

       (b)    "period of delay" means the period commencing on the day 
              fixed by the <em>Contract</em> for completion of the <em>Work</em> and ending

              completed, but excluding therefrom any day within a period of 
              extension granted under subsection 1, if on such day, in the 
              opinion of the <em>Minister</em>, causes beyond the control of the 
              Contractor delayed completion of the <em>Work</em>.

4.     The <em>Minister</em> may, if in his opinion it is in the public interest, 
       waive the right of <em>Canada</em> to the whole or any part of a payment 
       payable pursuant to subsection 2.

              commencing or in diligently executing the <em>Work</em> or any portion 
              thereof to the satisfaction of the <em>Engineer</em> and the <em>Minister</em> 
              or the <em>Engineer</em> has given notice thereof to the Contractor 
              and has by such notice required the Contractor to put an end 
              to such default or delay, and such default or delay continues 
              for six days after such notice was communicated;

       (b)    where the Contractor has made default in the completion of 
              the <em>Work</em>, or any portion thereof, within the time limited for 
              such completion by the <em>Contract</em>;

       (c)    where the Contractor has become insolvent;

       (d)    where the Contractor has committed an act of bankruptcy;

       (e)    where the Contractor has abandoned the <em>Work</em>;

       Certificate of Completion.

2.     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Contractor shall not, 
       unless otherwise instructed by the Minister, effect Fire Insurance

       provide that, if Canada sustains loss from a risk insured against in 
       circumstances which give Canada a cause of action against the 
       Contractor, the policy shall protect Canada in the same manner as it 
       would any other claimant:

       (a)    General Public Liability to third parties, up to $100,000 for 
              death or injury to any one person arising from one accident

       of Canada as their respective interests may appear and, as provided 
       by subsection 2 of section 31 of these General Conditions, all fire
