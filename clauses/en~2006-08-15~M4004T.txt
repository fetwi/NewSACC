<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive requests for standing offers in 
which the Canadian Content policy is applicable (see Supply Manual), where 
competition is being solely limited to offers offering Canadian goods and/or 
services and where it is mandatory that offerors submit a certification with 
their offer.  This clause is to be for multi-item requirements that are being 
certified on an individual item basis and where the offeror is to list in the 
clause those items in its offer that are to be considered Canadian.

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K4000D.

       defined in clause K4000D.

4.     The Offeror acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate offers and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this request for standing offers.  Such 
       representation and warranty of Canadian content may be verified in 
       such manner as Canada may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by Canada disclose a breach of such covenant, 
       Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       Standing Offer as being in default.

6.     Failure to execute this representation and warrantee on the 
       signature block immediately following this paragraph and to include 
       it with the offer will render the offer non-responsive.
