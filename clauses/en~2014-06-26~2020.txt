<h2>2020 01 (2013-04-25) Interpretation</h2>
<p>"<dfn>Canada</dfn>", "<dfn>Crown</dfn>", "<dfn>Her Majesty</dfn>" or "<dfn>the Government</dfn>"
means Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada as represented by
the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and any other
person duly authorized to act on behalf of that Minister;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Supplier</dfn>" means the person or entity whose name
appears on the Supply Arrangement and who has become a
pre-qualified supplier and been issued a Supply Arrangement;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Supply Arrangement</dfn>" means the written arrangement
between Canada and the Supplier, these general conditions, any
referenced clauses and conditions, and any other document specified
or referred to as forming part of the Supply Arrangement;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Supply Arrangement Authority</dfn>" means the person

<h2>2020 02 (2008-12-12) Standard Clauses and Conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 16, the clauses and conditions
identified in the Supply Arrangement by number, date and title are
incorporated by reference into the Supply Arrangement and form part
of any contract resulting from the Supply Arrangement as though
expressly set out in the Supply Arrangement and resulting
contract.</p>
<h2>2020 03 (2011-05-16) Bid Solicitations and Resulting
Contracts</h2>
<p>The Supplier understands that identified users are allowed under
a Supply Arrangement to solicit bids and award contracts to
pre-qualified suppliers only. Suppliers must be pre-qualified and
issued a Supply Arrangement to meet the requirements of a bid
solicitation and/or be awarded a contract under a Supply
Arrangement. If the Supply Arrangement includes ceiling prices or
rates, suppliers will be allowed to lower their prices or rates
based on the actual requirement or statement of work described in
the bid solicitation. For competitive requirements, bid
solicitations will be issued in accordance with the process
established in the Supply Arrangement. Bids will be evaluated and
contracts will be awarded in accordance with the process described
in each bid solicitation. Each contract awarded will be considered
to be a separate binding contract established between the
contracting department or agency and the Supplier.</p>
<p>The Supplier understands and agrees that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">issuance of a supply arrangement to the Supplier does
not oblige Canada to authorize or order all or any of the goods or
services described in the Supply Arrangement or to spend any monies
whatsoever;</li>
<li value="2">a contract will exist only if there is an authorized
contract awarded under the Supply Arrangement and only for those
goods, services, or both which are described in the contract;</li>
<li value="3">Canada's liability is limited to that which arises
from contracts awarded under the Supply Arrangement;</li>
<li value="4">Canada has the right to procure the goods and
services specified in the Supply Arrangement by means of any other
contract, standing offer or contracting method;</li>
<li value="5">neither the Supply Arrangement nor any bid in
response to a bid solicitation issued in accordance with it can be
assigned or transferred in whole or in part.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2020 04 (2008-12-12) Supply Arrangement Period</h2>
<p>The Supply Arrangement may be issued for a specific period as
set out in the Supply Arrangement or until such time as Canada no
longer considers it to be advantageous to use the Supply
Arrangement to award contracts under the Supply Arrangement
framework.</p>
<h2>2020 05 (2008-12-12) Modifications</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">From time to time, Canada may modify the conditions
of the Supply Arrangement. Canada will advise all suppliers of any
proposed modification to the supply arrangement and will provide
suppliers with an opportunity to either withdraw or confirm their
consent to the modification. The Supplier may withdraw if it no
longer wishes to be considered for future contracts as a result of
the modification. If the Supplier does not withdraw, the Supplier
must confirm its consent to the modification and confirm that it
meets any qualification requirement that may be affected by the
modification. The Supplier must provide any information or evidence
the Supply Arrangement Authority may require to verify that the
Supplier continues to be a qualified supplier.</li>
<li value="2">Canada may also, from time to time, update the
conditions of the bid solicitation and resulting contract clauses
included in the Supply Arrangement. Canada will then publish the
updates no less than ten (10) working days before including them in
any individual bid solicitation. Canada may also modify the
requirement described in the Supply Arrangement or, if the Supply
Arrangement includes categories, modify the requirements associated
with categories. If Canada adds a new category, the Supplier may
submit an application to qualify for that category. Upon successful
qualification, that category will simply be added to the Supplier's
existing Supply Arrangement. In the event of a modification to the
requirement, the Supplier may either be required to qualify in
respect to the modification only or to submit another arrangement,
depending on the extent of the modification.</li>
<li value="3">Modifications will not affect contracts that are
already in place before the date of the modification.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2020 06 (2008-12-12) Confirmation of Qualification</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Supplier must continue to meet all the
qualification requirements related to the Supply Arrangement during
the entire period of the Supply Arrangement. Any certification
provided by the Supplier must be true on the date of the Supply
Arrangement and remain true throughout the period of the Supply
Arrangement. The Supplier must immediately notify the Supply
Arrangement Authority if it no longer meets any of the
qualification requirements of the Supply Arrangement.</li>
<li value="2">The Supply Arrangement Authority may require the
Supplier to confirm its qualification at any time and provide
evidence to support its confirmation. If the Supplier no longer
meets any of the requirements for qualification, Canada may, at its
option:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">suspend the Supply Arrangement until the Supplier has
demonstrated, to the satisfaction of Canada, that it meets the
requirements in respect of which it has been found deficient.
During this time, the Supplier will not be eligible to bid on bid
solicitations issued under the Supply Arrangement;</li>
<li value="2">suspend the Supplier's qualification under specific
categories of the Supply Arrangement until the Supplier has
demonstrated, to the satisfaction of Canada, that it meets the
requirements in respect of which it has been found deficient.
During this time, the Supplier will not be eligible to bid on bid
solicitations issued under Supply Arrangement for those
categories;</li>
<li value="3">cancel the Supply Arrangement or the Supplier's
qualification for specific categories, in which case, the Supplier
will not be allowed to submit a new arrangement for a period of six
(6) months following the cancellation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2020 07 (2008-12-12) On-going Opportunity For
Qualification</h2>
<p>The Supplier understands that either through a notice posted on
the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) or through a
process set out in the Supply Arrangement, new suppliers may submit
arrangements to pre-qualify and be added to the list of suppliers
pre-qualified to provide the goods and services described in the
Supply Arrangement. This process will also permit pre-qualified
suppliers to qualify for requirements for which they are not
already qualified. The Supplier acknowledges that Canada may issue
an unlimited number of supply arrangements and may continue to
issue supply arrangements to pre-qualified suppliers throughout the
Supply Arrangement period.</p>
<h2>2020 08 (2008-12-12) Withdrawal by Supplier</h2>
<p>If the Supplier wishes to withdraw from the Supply Arrangement
or only from any specific category, the Supplier must advise Canada
by providing no less than thirty (30) days written notice to the
Supply Arrangement Authority, unless provided otherwise in the
Supply Arrangement.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the notice, the Supply Arrangement Authority
will remove the Supplier from the list of pre-qualified suppliers
and the Supplier will not be eligible to bid on bid solicitations
issued under the Supply Arrangement anymore. The Supplier will be
required to qualify again to become a pre-qualified supplier.</p>
<p>The Supplier acknowledges that its withdrawal will not affect
any contract entered into before the receipt by the Supply
Arrangement Authority of the notice. Canada may at its discretion
advise the Supplier that the Supplier will not be allowed to submit
a new arrangement to re-qualify for a period of time as determined
by Canada.</p>
<h2>2020 09 (2008-12-12) Suspension or Cancellation of
Qualification by Canada</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may, by sending written notice to the
Supplier, suspend or cancel the Supply Arrangement under any of the
following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Supplier no longer meets any of the required
qualifications of the Supply Arrangement as provided in section
6;</li>
<li value="2">the Supplier is in default in carrying out any of its
obligations under any resulting contract and Canada has exercised
its contractual right to terminate the contract for default;</li>
<li value="3">Canada has imposed measures on the Supplier under the
Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy (or such similar policy that may be in
place from time to time).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Suspension or cancellation of the Supply Arrangement
will not affect the right of Canada to pursue other remedies or
measures that may be available. It will not, on its own, affect any
contract entered into before the issuance of the notice. The Supply
Arrangement Authority will however remove the Supplier from the
list of pre-qualified suppliers and the Supplier will not be
eligible to bid on bid solicitations issued under the Supply
Arrangement. The Supplier will not be allowed to submit another
arrangement for a period to be determined by Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2020 10 (2008-12-12) Termination of Contracts made under the
Supply Arrangement</h2>
<p>If a contract made under the Supply Arrangement is terminated
for default or otherwise, such termination does not terminate the
Supply Arrangement. The Supplier acknowledges, however, that a
default under any contract made under the Supply Arrangement may
result in the suspension or cancellation of the Supply
Arrangement.</p>
<h2>2020 11 (2008-12-12) Joint Venture</h2>
<p>If the Supplier is a joint venture, the Supplier agrees that all
members of the joint venture are jointly and severally or
solidarily liable for the performance of any contract awarded under
the Supply Arrangement. If the membership of a joint venture
changes, the Supply Arrangement will be cancelled and members who
wish to qualify separately or as part of a different joint venture
must submit a new arrangement by following the qualification
process established by Canada.</p>
<h2>2020 12 (2008-05-12) Publication of Supply Arrangement
Information</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Supplier agrees that Canada may publish certain
information related to the Supply Arrangement or a supply
arrangement catalogue. The Supplier agrees to the disclosure of the
following information included in the Supply Arrangement:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the conditions of the Supply Arrangement;</li>
<li value="2">the Supplier's procurement business number, its name,
the name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address
of its representative;</li>
<li value="3">the Supplier's profile and its level of security
clearance;</li>
<li value="4">the Supplier's qualified domains of expertise or the
categories for which the Supplier has qualified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Canada will not be liable for any errors,
inconsistencies or omissions in any published information. If the
Supplier identifies any error, inconsistency or omission, the
Supplier agrees to notify the Supply Arrangement Authority
immediately.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2020 13 (2008-12-12) Application of Trade Agreements</h2>
<p>The Supplier understands that even if the qualification process
established for the issuance of the Supply Arrangement was subject
to the <cite>World Trade Organization Agreement on Government
Procurement</cite>, the <cite>North American Free Trade Agreement</cite>, and the
<cite>Agreement on Internal Trade</cite>, not all three agreements will
necessarily apply to individual bid solicitations under the Supply
Arrangement. The trade agreements applicable to individual bid
solicitations will be identified on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h2>2020 14 (2008-05-12) Costs</h2>
<p>The Supplier will not be reimbursed for any costs incurred
before the award of a contract and no costs incurred before the
award of a contract can be charged to the Supply Arrangement or any
contract entered into under the Supply Arrangement.</p>
<h2>2020	15	(2012-07-16) Disclosure of Information</h2>
<p>The Supplier agrees to the disclosure of its supply arrangement unit prices or rates by Canada, and further agrees that it will have no right to claim against Canada, the Identified User, their employees, agents or servants in relation to such disclosure.</p>
<h2>2020 16 (2014-03-01) Integrity Provisions - Supply Arrangement</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>	The Supplier agrees to comply with the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite> and to be bound by its terms. In addition, the Supplier must also comply with the terms set out in these Integrity Provisions.</li>
<li value="2">	The Supplier confirms that it understands that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences may result in the Supply Arrangement being cancelled and terminating for default any resulting contracts. If the Supplier made a false declaration in its arrangement, makes a false declaration under the Contract, fails to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested, or if the Supplier or any of the Supplier's Affiliates fail to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions during the period of the Supply Arrangement, such false declaration or failure to comply may result, following a notice period, in the cancellation of the Supply Arrangement and the termination for default of any resulting contracts. The Supplier understands that a termination for default will not restrict Canadaâ€™s right to exercise any other remedies that may be available against the Supplier and agrees to immediately return any advance payments.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Supplier's Affiliates if:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be. </li>
<li value="4">	The Supplier who is incorporated or who is a sole proprietorship has already provided a list of names of all individuals who are directors of the Supplier or the name of the owner. The Supplier who has submitted an arrangement as a joint venture has already provided a list of names of all directors, or the name of the owner, for each member of the joint venture. The Supplier must diligently inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list of names of directors during the period of the Supply Arrangement and of any resulting contracts. The Supplier must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms and associated information, and cooperate to the verification process.</li>
<li value="5">	The Supplier certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware that Canada may verify the information provided by the Supplier, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="6">	The Supplier certifies that neither the Supplier nor any of the Supplier's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Supply Arrangement and any resulting contracts if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
<li value="7"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

In addition, for a conviction under paragraphs a. or b. of subsection 8, following the 10-year period, a pardon or a record suspension must have been obtained, or capacities must have been restored by the Governor in Council. The Supplier must therefore provide a copy of confirming documentation from an official source for its certification to be found true by Canada for the purpose of these Integrity Provisions.</li>
<li value="8">	The Supplier certifies that neither the Supplier nor any of the Supplierâ€™s Affiliates have been convicted of an offence or received a conditional or an absolute discharge under any of the following provisions, unless the time period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, has elapsed:

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>), subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="2">section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor subscribing to election fund</em>), section 124 (<em>Selling or Purchasing Office</em>), section 380 (<em>Fraud</em>) for fraud committed against Her Majesty or section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="3">section 119 (<em>Bribery of judicial officers, etc</em>), section 120 (<em>Bribery of officers</em>), section 346 (<em>Extortion</em>), sections 366 to 368 (<em>Forgery and other offences resembling forgery</em>), section 382 (<em>Fraudulent manipulation of stock exchange transactions</em>), section 382.1 (<em>Prohibited insider trading</em>), section 397 (<em>Falsification of books and documents</em>), section 422 (<em>Criminal breach of contract</em>), section 426 (<em>Secret commissions</em>), section 462.31 (<em>Laundering proceeds of crime</em>) or sections 467.11 to 467.13 (<em>Participation in activities of criminal organization</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="4">section 45 (<em>Conspiracies, agreements or arrangements between competitors</em>), section 46 (<em>Foreign directives</em>), section 47 (<em>Bid rigging</em>), section 49 (<em>Agreements or arrangements of federal financial institutions</em>), section 52 (<em>False or misleading representation</em>), section 53 (<em>Deceptive notice of winning a prize</em>) of the <cite>Competition Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="5">section 239 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="6">section 327 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Excise Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="7">section 3 (<em>Bribing a foreign public official</em>), section 4 (<em>Accounting</em>), or section 5 (<em>Offence committed outside Canada</em>) of the <cite>Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="8">section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</cite>.</li>
</ol>

The Supplier also certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a. or b. are to receive any benefit under a contract resulting from this Supply Arrangement, unless a pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, as defined in the Time Period subsection.</li>
<li value="9"><dfn>Foreign Offences</dfn><br/>
The Supplier also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Supplier nor any of the Supplierâ€™s Affiliates have been convicted or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions. Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to a Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council.</li>
<li value="10"><dfn>Subcontractors</dfn><br/>
The Supplier must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no less favourable to Canada than those imposed in the resulting contract.</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
For governments, as well as entities controlled by a government, including Crown corporations, the present Integrity Provisions are reduced to complying with article 750 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, the <cite>Government Contracts Regulations</cite> and the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2020  17  (2012-07-16) Access to Information</h2>
<p>Records created by the Supplier, and under the control of Canada, are subject to the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>. The Supplier acknowledges the responsibilities of Canada under the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> and must, to the extent possible, assist Canada in discharging these responsibilities. Furthermore, the Supplier acknowledges that section 67.1 of the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> provides that any person, who destroys, alters, falsifies or conceals a record, or directs anyone to do so, with the intent of obstructing the right of access that is provided by the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> is guilty of an offence and is liable to imprisonment or a fine, or both.
