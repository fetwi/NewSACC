<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The price in Canadian currency includes the foreign currency 
       component in respect of goods, services or both originating outside 
       Canada, as detailed on form PWGSC-TPSGC 9411, Claim for Exchange 
       Rate Adjustments (http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/acquisitions/text/forms/
       forms-e.html), in Annex ______.  In the event that one or more of 
       the milestones involve a foreign currency component that becomes due 
       and payable on that particular milestone, a separate form 
       PWGSC-TPSGC 9411 must accompany the invoice for each applicable 
       milestone.

2.     When a milestone payable includes the importation of goods, services 
       or both into Canada, the exchange rate used to calculate the 
       adjustment will be the rate applied by Canada Border Services Agency 
       (CBSA) on the date of importation.  For a milestone that does not 
       involve the importation of goods, services or both, but still 
       includes a foreign currency component, the exchange rate used to 
       calculate the adjustment will be the Bank of Canada exchange rate in 
       effect at noon, on the date when the milestone became due and 
       payable.

3.     No price adjustment directly resulting from the application of the 
       provisions contained in this clause will be applied for increases or 
       decreases in the exchange rate within a variation of: plus or minus 
       2 percent of the exchange rate(s) mentioned above; or plus or minus $100 
       of the total cumulative amount claimed for exchange rate adjustment 
       under the Contract.

4.     On each invoice or claim for milestone payment submitted under the 
       Contract, the Contractor must indicate the exchange rate adjustment 
       amount (either upward, downward or no change) as a separate item.  
       In the event of delivery, the invoice or claim for milestone payment 
       must be accompanied by a copy of CBSA Form B3-3, Canada Customs 
       Coding Form.  When the goods, services or both have not been 
       imported, the Contractor must provide evidence, satisfactory to 
       Canada, that the amount claimed is due and payable in foreign 
       currency by the Contractor.

5.     Canada will have the right to audit any revision to costs and prices 
under this clause.
