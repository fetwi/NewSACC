<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<p>The evaluation team will determine first if there are three (3)
or more bids with a valid Canadian content certification. In that
event, the evaluation process will be limited to the bids with the
certification; otherwise, all bids will be evaluated. If some of
the bids with a valid certification are declared non-responsive, or
are withdrawn, and less than three responsive bids with a valid
certification remain, the evaluation will continue among those bids
with a valid certification. If all bids with a valid certification
are subsequently declared non-responsive, or are withdrawn, then
all the other bids received will be evaluated.</p>
