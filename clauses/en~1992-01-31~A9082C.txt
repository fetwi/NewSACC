<pre>(1) The Contractor shall provide the services of the personnel named in the 
Contractor's proposal to perform the Work, unless the Contractor is unable 
to do so for reasons which are beyond its control.

(2) Should the Contractor at any time be unable to provide their services, 
it shall be responsible, at its costs, for providing replacement persons 
who shall be of similar ability and attainment and who shall be acceptable 
to both the Project Authority and Contracting Authority. At least thirty 
(30) days, where possible, in advance of the date upon which replacement

the Project Authority and the Contracting Authority of:

(a) the reason for the removal of the named personnel from the Work;

(c) the qualifications and experience of the proposed replacement persons.

(3) In no event shall the Contractor allow performance of the Work by 
unauthorized replacement persons.

(4) Acceptance of a replacement person by the Project Authority and the 
   Contracting Authority shall not relieve the Contractor from 
   responsibility for failure to meet the requirements of the contract.
