<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause when a proposed contractor has started work at its own 
risk without the authorization of a government official, prior to contract 
authorization, and the work has not been completed.  This will ensure that the 
work done prior to the contract date will be covered by the contract.  

If the work has been completed, the contracting officer must request that a 
confirming order be prepared by legal counsel.

The second paragraph is to be deleted if the client department does not wish to 
retain the rights to the intellectual property.  In addition, add clause C0210C 
to the Basis of Payment.
