<pre>If for reasons beyond its control, the Offeror is unable to provide the 
services of an individual named in its offer, the Offeror may propose a 
substitute with similar qualifications and experience.  The Offeror must 
advise the Standing Offer Authority of the reason for the substitution and 
provide the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed replacement.  
For the purposes of this clause, only the following reasons will be 
considered as beyond the control of the Offeror: death, sickness, 
retirement, resignation, dismissal for cause or termination of an agreement 
for default.

If the Offeror is unable to provide a substitute with similar 
   qualifications and experience, Canada may set aside the standing offer.
