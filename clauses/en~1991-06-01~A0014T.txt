<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>In any refit/repair or docking contract, unscheduled work will arise after 
the vessel and its equipment is opened up and surveyed. Since this work is 
inevitable, the anticipated cost of such work must be taken into account 
when evaluating the bids. This is done by including a most likely amount of 
additional personhours (and/or material) to which a competitive charge-out 
rate is applied in dollars, and is added to the firm price for the Work.    

The overall total is known as the "Evaluation Price" which is the price 
   used for evaluating the bids. There is no minimum or maximum amount of 
   unscheduled work nor is there a guarantee of such work, but rather it is 
   a most likely work estimate based on historical experience.
