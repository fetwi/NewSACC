Contract is to receive the deliverables contracted for, to be able
to use those deliverables, and any Intellectual Property arising by
virtue of the Contract for Canada's activities, including future
contracts, procurements and to protect or advance the broader
public interest. These supplemental general conditions do not
affect any existing Intellectual Property Rights in any information
belonging to Canada, the Contractor or a third party.</li>
<li value="3">Words and expressions defined in the General
Conditions and used in these supplemental general conditions have
the meanings given to them in the General Conditions. In the event
of any inconsistency between the General Conditions and these
supplemental general conditions, the applicable provisions of these
supplemental general conditions will prevail. If the General
Conditions include a section on "Copyright", they are amended by
deleting the section in its entirety.</li>
<li value="4">If supplemental general conditions 4001, 4003 and

Information</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">During and after the performance of the Contract, the
Contractor must keep detailed records of the Foreground
Information, including details of its creation, ownership and about
any sale or transfer of any right in the Foreground Information.
The Contractor must report and fully disclose to Canada all
Foreground Information as required by the Contract. If the Contract
does not specifically state when and how the Contractor must do so,
the Contractor must provide this information when requested by the
Contracting Authority or a representative of the department or
agency for which the Contract is performed, whether before or after
the completion of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">Before and after final payment to the Contractor, the
Contractor must provide Canada with access to all records and
supporting data that Canada considers pertinent to the
identification of Foreground Information.</li>
<li value="3">For any Intellectual Property that was developed or
created in relation to the Work, Canada will be entitled to assume
that it was developed or created by Canada, if the Contractor's
records do not list that Intellectual Property or do not indicate
that it was created by the Contractor, or by someone on behalf of
the Contractor, other than Canada.</li>

in Foreground Information</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground
Information belong to the Contractor as soon as they come into
existence.</li>
<li value="2">Despite the Contractor's ownership of all the
Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground Information, Canada
has unrestricted ownership rights in any prototype, model, custom
or customized system or equipment that is a deliverable under the
Contract, including manuals and other operating and maintenance
documents. This includes the right to make them available for
public use, whether for a fee or otherwise, sell them or otherwise
transfer ownership in them.</li>
<li value="3">Any personal information, as defined in the
<cite>Privacy Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes (1985)">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. P-21, collected by the
Contractor in the execution of the Work under the Contract becomes
the property of Canada immediately upon collection and must be used
only for the performance of the Work. The Contractor has no right
in any such personal information.</li>
<li value="4">If the Work under the Contract involves the
preparation of a database or other compilation using information or
data supplied by Canada and any personal information referred to
above, the Intellectual Property Rights in the database or
compilation containing such information will belong to Canada. The
Contractor's Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground
Information are restricted to those capable of being exploited
without the use of the information or data supplied by Canada and
the personal information.</li>
<li value="5">The Contractor must maintain the confidentiality of
the information or data supplied by Canada and the personal
information as required in the General Conditions. The Contractor
must return all the information belonging to Canada on request or
on completion or termination of the Contract. This includes
returning all hard copies and electronic copies as well as any
paper or electronic record that contains any part of the
information or information derived from it.</li>

<h2 id="2010-08-164006licenses-to-intellectual-property-rights">4006 04 (2008-05-12) Licenses to Intellectual Property Rights
in Foreground and Background Information</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">As Canada has contributed to the cost of developing
the Foreground Information, the Contractor grants to Canada a
license to exercise all Intellectual Property Rights in the
Foreground Information for Canada's activities. Subject to any
exception described in the Contract, this license allows Canada to
do anything that it would be able to do if it were the owner of the
Foreground Information, other than exploit it commercially and
transfer or assign ownership of it. The Contractor also grants to
Canada a license to use the Background Information to the extent
that it is reasonably necessary for Canada to exercise fully all
its rights in the deliverables and in the Foreground
Information.</li>
<li value="2">These licenses are non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, worldwide, fully-paid and royalty-free. Neither
license can be restricted in any way by the Contractor providing
any form of notice to the contrary, including the wording on any
shrink-wrap or click-wrap license or any other kind of packaging,
attached to any deliverable.</li>
<li value="3">For greater certainty, Canada's licenses include, but
are not limited to:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the right to disclose the Foreground and Background
Information to third parties bidding on or negotiating contracts
with Canada and to sublicense or otherwise authorize the use of
that information by any contractor engaged by Canada solely for the
purpose of carrying out such contracts. Canada will require these
third parties and contractors not to use or disclose that
information except as may be necessary to bid on, negotiate or
carry out those contracts;</li>
<li value="2">the right to disclose the Foreground and Background
Information to other governments for information purposes;</li>
<li value="3">the right to reproduce, modify, improve, develop or
translate the Foreground and Background Information or have it done
by a person hired by Canada. Canada, or a person designated by
Canada, will own the Intellectual Property Rights associated with
the reproduction, modification, improvement, development or
translation;</li>
<li value="4">without restricting the scope of any license or other
right in the Background Information that Canada may otherwise hold,
the right, in relation to any custom-designed or
custom-manufactured part of the Work, to exercise such of the
Intellectual Property Rights in the Background Information as may
be required for the following purposes:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">for the use, operation, maintenance, repair or
overhaul of the custom-designed or custom-manufactured parts of the
Work;</li>
<li value="2">in the manufacturing of spare parts for maintenance, repair
or overhaul of any custom-designed or custom-manufactured part of
the Work by Canada, if those parts are not available on reasonable
commercial terms to enable timely maintenance, repair or
overhaul;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">for Software that is custom designed for Canada, the
right to use any source code the Contractor must deliver to Canada
under the Contract.</li>
</ol></li>
<li value="4">The Contractor agrees to make the Background
Information, including in the case of Software, the source code
promptly available to Canada for any purpose mentioned above. The
license does not apply to any Software that is subject to detailed
license conditions that are set out elsewhere in the Contract.
Furthermore, in the case of commercial off-the-shelf software, the
Contractor's obligation to make the source code promptly available
to Canada applies only to source code that is within the control of
or can be obtained by the Contractor or any subcontractor.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164006contractor-s-right-to-grant-licenses">4006 05 (2008-05-12) Contractor's Right to Grant Licenses</h2>
<p>The Contractor represents and warrants that it has the right to
grant to Canada the licenses and any other rights to use the
Foreground and Background Information. If the Intellectual Property
Rights in any Foreground or Background Information are or will be
owned by a subcontractor or any other third party, the Contractor
must have or obtain promptly a license from that subcontractor or
third party that permits compliance with section 4 or arrange,
without delay, for the subcontractor or third party to grant
promptly any required license directly to Canada.</p>
<h2 id="2010-08-164006waiver-of-moral-rights">4006 06 (2008-05-12) Waiver of Moral Rights</h2>
<p>If requested by Canada, during and after the Contract, the
Contractor must provide a written permanent waiver of moral rights,
as defined in the <cite>Copyright Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes (1985)">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. C-42,
from every author that contributes to any Foreground Information
subject to copyright protection that is a deliverable to Canada
under the Contract. If the Contractor is an author of the
Foreground Information, the Contractor permanently waives the
Contractor's moral rights in that Foreground Information.</p>

Canada's Information</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Any information supplied by Canada to the Contractor
for the performance of the Work remains the property of Canada. The
Contractor must use Canada's Information only to perform the
Contract.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor wants to use any information owned
by Canada for the commercial exploitation or further development of
the Foreground Information, the Contractor must obtain a license
from the department or agency for which the Contract is performed.
In its request for a license to that department or agency, the
Contractor must explain why the license is required and how the
Contractor intends to use the information. If the department or
agency agrees to grant a license, conditions will be negotiated
between the Contractor and that department or agency and may
include the payment of a compensation to Canada.</li>

<h2 id="2010-08-164006transfer-or-license-of-contractor-s-rights">4006 08 (2008-05-12) Transfer or License of Contractor's
Rights</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">During the Contract, the Contractor must not sell,
transfer, assign or license the Foreground Information without
first obtaining the Contracting Authority's written
permission.</li>
<li value="2">After the Contract, if the Contractor transfer
ownership in the Foreground Information, the Contractor is not
required to obtain Canada's permission, but must notify the
department or agency for whom the Contract is performed in writing
of the transfer by referring to the serial number of the Contract
and its date and by providing details about the transferee,
including the conditions of the transfer. The Contractor must
ensure that the transfer requires the transferee to notify the
Canada of any future transfer. Any transfer must be subject to all
Canada's rights to use the Foreground Information.</li>
<li value="3">After the Contract, if the Contractor grants a
license or any other right (other than a transfer of ownership) to
a third party to use the Foreground Information, the Contractor is
not required to notify Canada, but the license or right granted
must not affect Canada's rights in any way.</li>
<li value="4">If the Contractor at any time transfers ownership of
or grants rights in the Foreground Information that interfere in
any way with Canada's rights to use the Foreground Information, the
Contractor must, if requested by Canada, immediately take all steps
necessary to restore Canada's rights. If the Contractor is not
successful in doing so, within the time reasonably required by
Canada, the Contractor must immediately reimburse Canada for all
costs Canada incurs to do so itself.</li>

<h2 id="2010-08-164006transfer-of-intellectual-property-rights-upon-termination">4006 09 (2008-05-12) Transfer of Intellectual Property Rights
upon Termination of the Contract for Default</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If Canada terminates the Contract in whole or in part
for default, Canada may, by giving notice to the Contractor,
require the Contractor to transfer to Canada all the Intellectual
Property Rights in the Foreground Information, including the rights
owned by subcontractors. In the case of Intellectual Property
Rights in the Foreground Information that have been sold or
assigned to a third party, the Contractor must pay to Canada on
demand, at Canada's discretion, the fair market value of the
Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground Information or an
amount equal to the payment received by the Contractor from the
sale or assignment of the Intellectual Property Rights in the
Foreground Information.</li>
<li value="2">In the event of the issuance of a notice under
subsection 1, the Contractor must, at its own expense and without
delay, execute such documents relating to ownership of the
Intellectual Property Rights as Canada may require. The Contractor
must, at Canada's expense, provide all reasonable assistance in the
preparation of applications and in the prosecution of any
applications for registration of any Intellectual Property Rights
in any jurisdiction, including the assistance of the inventor in
the case of an invention.</li>

Information</h2>
<p>If the Contractor uses the Foreground Information to develop any
new product or any improvement in any existing product, the
Contractor agrees that, if Canada wishes to purchase such new or
improved product, the Contractor must sell them to Canada at a
discount off the lowest price for which it has sold those products
to other customers, to recognize Canada's financial contribution to
the development of those products.</p>
