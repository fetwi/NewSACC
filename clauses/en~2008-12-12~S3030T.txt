<pre>Use the following clause in requests for supply arrangements valued at $200,000 
or more (including all applicable taxes), except for requirements excluded under 
paragraphs 5.129 (d), (e) and (f) of the Supply Manual. (Consult also procedure

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) 
       requires that some suppliers  bidding for federal government 
       contracts, valued at $200,000 or more (including all applicable 
       taxes), make a formal commitment to implement employment equity.  
       This is a condition precedent to the issuance of a supply 
       arrangement.  If the Supplier is subject to the FCP-EE, evidence of 
       its commitment must be provided before the issuance of a supply 
       arrangement.

       Suppliers who have been declared ineligible contractors by Human 
       Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer 
       eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold for 
       solicitation of bids as set out in the Government Contract 
       Regulations.  Suppliers may be declared ineligible contractors 
       either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRSDC, or 
       following their voluntary withdrawal from the FCP-EE for a reason 
       other than the reduction of their workforce to less than 100 
       employees.  Any arrangements from ineligible contractors will be 
       declared non-responsive.

2.     If the Supplier does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 3.(
       a) or (b) below, or does not have a valid certificate number 
       confirming its adherence to the FCP-EE, the Supplier must fax 
       (819-953-8768) a copy of the signed form LAB 1168, Certificate of 
       Commitment to Implement Employment Equity (http://www1.servicecanada.gc.ca
       /cgi-bin/search/eforms/index.cgi?app=profile&amp;form=lab1168&amp;dept=sc?=e), 
       to the Labour Branch of HRSDC.

3.     The Supplier certifies its status with the FCP-EE, as follows:

       The Supplier 

       (a)    (    ) is not subject to the FCP-EE, having a workforce of 
                     less than 100 permanent full time, part-time or 
                     temporary employees in Canada,

       (b)    (    ) is not subject to the FCP-EE, being a regulated 
                     employer under the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>, S.C. 1995, c. 
                     44;

       (c)    (    ) is subject to the requirements of the FCP-EE, having a

                     part-time or temporary employees in Canada, but has 
                     not previously obtained a certificate number from 
                     HRSDC, (having not bid on requirements of $200,000 or 
                     more), in which case a duly signed certificate of 
                     commitment is attached;

       (d)    (    ) is subject to the FCP-EE, and has a valid certificate
