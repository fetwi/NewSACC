  Use this clause with a fixed price basis of payment in accordance with Supply Manual section
  
   4.70.20.2
  
  and the
  
   Practitioner’s Guide for Procurement Pricing
  
  , section 4.1.1.
 </p>
<p>
  The contracting authority must perform price validation using market or cost-based prices before incorporating this clause as there is no provision for subsequent adjustment to the price in a fixed price contract. When using this clause, it is important that the total fixed price is included in the contract to ensure the contract’s pricing is clear.
 </p>
<p>
  Insert the appropriate text when all the work is subject to a fixed price (Option 1) or only a portion of the work is subject to a fixed price (Option 2).
