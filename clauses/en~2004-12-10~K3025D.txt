<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause only where the Contractor is to own the foreground 
information and where supplemental general conditions 9601-6 form part of the 
Contract.

This clause is intended for use where the Contractor is engaged to, essentially, 
produce a new product and where the client department has determined that it 
wishes to have a broader license to the Contractor's Background Information to 
allow for further development of that product, including, possibly, production 
of it for Canada's use.

       replaced by the following:

       "<strong>05    License to Intellectual Property Rights in Background 
              Information</strong><strong></strong>

       1.     Without restricting the scope of any license or other right 
              in the Background Information that Canada may otherwise hold, 
              the Contractor hereby grants to Canada a non-exclusive, 
              perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully-paid and 
              royalty-free license to exercise such of the Intellectual 
              Property Rights in any Background Information incorporated 
              into the Work or necessary for the performance of the Work as 
              may be required in order for Canada to exercise its license 
              in the Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground 
              Information.  The Contractor agrees, subject to subsection 4, 
              to make any such Background Information (including, in the 
              case of Software, source code) promptly available to Canada 
              for any such purpose.

       2.     The Contractor acknowledges that Canada may wish to award 
              contracts for a purpose contemplated in subsection 1 and that 
              such contract awards may follow a competitive process.  The 
              Contractor agrees that Canada's license in relation to the 
              Intellectual Property Rights in Background Information 
              includes the right to disclose the Background Information to 
              bidders for such contracts, and to sublicense or otherwise 
              authorize the use of that information by any contractor 
              engaged by Canada solely for the purpose of carrying out such 
              a contract.  Canada shall require bidders and the contractor 
              not to use or disclose any Background Information except as 
              may be necessary to bid for or to carry out that contract.

       3.     Where the Intellectual Property Rights in any Background 
              Information are owned by a Subcontractor at any tier, the 
              Contractor shall either obtain a license from that 
              Subcontractor that permits compliance with subsections 1 and 
              2 or arrange for the Subcontractor to convey directly to 
              Canada the same rights by execution of the form provided for 
              that purpose by the Minister, in which case the Contractor 
              shall deliver that form to the Minister, duly completed and 
              executed by the Subcontractor, no later than the time of 
              disclosure to Canada of that Background Information.

       4.     Notwithstanding subsection 1, the license set out therein 
              shall not apply to any Software that is subject to detailed 
              license conditions that are set out elsewhere in the Contract. 
              Furthermore, in the case of commercial off-the-shelf software, 
              the Contractor's obligation to make the source code promptly 
              available to Canada for a purpose set out in subsection 1 
              shall apply only to source code that is within the control of 
              or can be obtained by the Contractor or any Subcontractor, 
              and in that event the Contractor shall, if requested by 
              Canada, make the source code available to Canada within 
              reasonable delivery times and on reasonable other commercial 
              terms." 
 
2.     Subsection 1 of section 10 of supplemental general conditions 9601-6 
       is deleted and replaced by the following:

       "<strong>10.   Waiver of Moral Rights</strong>

       1.     The Contractor shall provide to Canada, at the completion of 
              the Work or at such other time as the Minister may require, a 
              written permanent waiver of moral rights (as this term is 
              defined in the <em>Copyright Act</em>, R.S. 1985, c. C-42), in a form 
              acceptable to the Minister, from every author that 
              contributed to any Foreground Information which is subject to 
              copyright protection and which is deliverable to Canada under 
              the terms of the Contract."
