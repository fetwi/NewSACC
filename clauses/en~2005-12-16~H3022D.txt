<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Progress payments will only be made upon receipt of satisfactory 
       form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111, Claim for Progress Payment (<strong>http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca
       /acquisitions/text/forms/forms-e.html</strong>), as specified in the Contract.

2.     Progress claims are to be forwarded to the Project/Inspection 
       Authority for appropriate certification after inspection and 
       acceptance of the Work takes place.  Upon certification, the 
       original and two (2) copies of the claim are then forwarded to the 
       Contracting Authority for certification and onward submission to the 
       Project Manager's Payment Office for all remaining certifications 
       and payment action.

3.     Progress claims shall not be submitted by the Contractor until all 
       Work identified in the claim has been completed.

4.     Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST), as 
       appropriate, is to be calculated and paid on the total amount of the 
       claim before the 10 percent holdback is applied.  At the time that 
       the holdback is released, there will be no GST/HST payable, as it 
       was included in the previous payments.
