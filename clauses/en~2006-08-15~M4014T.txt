<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive requests for standing offers in 
which the Canadian Content policy is applicable (see Supply Manual), where 
competition is being solely limited to offers offering Canadian goods and/or 
services and where it is not mandatory that offers submit a certification with 
their offer.  This clause is to be used for multi-item requirements that are 
being certified on an individual item basis and where the offeror is to list in 
the clause those items in its offer that are to be considered Canadian.

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K4000D.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is limited to Canadian Goods and/or Services as 
       defined in clause K4000D.

2.     Offers may be accepted in whole or in part.

3.     The Offeror represents and warrants that, of the goods and/or 
       services being offered, the following items are Canadian goods and/
       or services as defined in clause K4000D, and acknowledges that only 
       those items will receive consideration.

4.     The Offeror acknowledges that Canada relies upon such representation 
       and warranty to evaluate offers and to issue a standing offer as a 
       result of the request for standing offers.  Such representation and 
       warranty of Canadian content may be verified in such manner as 
       Canada may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by Canada disclose a breach of such covenant, 
       Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       Standing Offer as being in default.

7.     The execution of this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph is a condition to render 
       the offer responsive.  Failure to provide the signed certification 
       upon request within ______ calendar days, if it is not submitted 
       with the offer, will render the offer non-responsive.
