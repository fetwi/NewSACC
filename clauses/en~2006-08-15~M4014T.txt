4.     The Offeror acknowledges that Canada relies upon such representation 
       and warranty to evaluate offers and to issue a standing offer as a 
       result of the request for standing offers.  Such representation and 
       warranty of Canadian content may be verified in such manner as 
       Canada may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by Canada disclose a breach of such covenant, 
       Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       Standing Offer as being in default.

7.     The execution of this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph is a condition to render 
       the offer responsive.  Failure to provide the signed certification 
       upon request within ______ calendar days, if it is not submitted 
       with the offer, will render the offer non-responsive.
