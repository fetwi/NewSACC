<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>This clause must only be used in contracts that are primarily for the provision 
of satellite services, because special authority was granted by the Treasury 
Board to allocate risk in accordance with this clause for contracts for 
satellite services only.  Contracting officers must complete paragraph (3)(d) in 
consultation with Risk Management Advisory Services (RMAS) or in accordance with 
published commodity groupings approved by RMAS.</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This section applies despite any other provision of the Contract and 
       replaces the section of the general conditions entitled "Liability".  
       Any reference in this article to damages caused by the Contractor 
       also includes damages caused by its employees, as well as its 
       subcontractors, agents, and representatives, and any of their 
       employees.<strong></strong>

2.     <strong>Interruptions to Satellite Services</strong>

       (a)    Despite anything in the Contract to the contrary, Canada 
              agrees to indemnify the Contractor against all liability, 
              damages, or claims made against the Contractor by any third 
              party that relate to the Contractor's satellite service being 
              interrupted or unavailable, as long as the reason the 
              Contractor's satellite service was interrupted or unavailable 
              was either:
              
              (i)    an event of force majeure, including, for example, 
                     acts of God, meteors, fire, flood, weather conditions, 
                     Sun Transit Period(s) (defined below), sun outages or 
                     other circumstances in the space environment over 
                     which the Contractor has no control, launch failure or 
                     other catastrophic failure of satellite, laws of any 
                     governmental entity, acts of terrorism, insurrections, 
                     embargoes, and wars; or

              (ii)   a malfunction that occurs for any reason after the 
                     satellite is launched, as long as the repairs cannot 
                     be made remotely before the damage occurs, or the cost 
                     of making the repairs is commercially unreasonable.

              This applies whether or not the event of force majeure or the 
              malfunction is foreseeable. Canada agrees that, in the event 
              of force majeure and/or malfunction as described above, 
              Canada will only be entitled to recover the service credits 
              relating to satellite service availability, if any, that are 
              described in the Contract.

       (b)    "Sun Transit Period" means the period when the noise 
              emissions from the sun degrade system performance at earth 
              stations below the specifications for the satellite services 
              to be provided by the Contractor under the Contract.

       (c)    Canada agrees that, if the satellite services being provided 
              by the Contractor under the Contract are interrupted or 
              unavailable for any reason not described in paragraph (a)(i) 
              or (ii), the amount that Canada can recover is subject to the 
              limit described in (3)(d) below or the service credits 
              relating to satellite service availability, if any, to which 
              Canada is entitled, whichever is more.

3.     <strong>First Party Liability of the Contractor to Canada:</strong>

       (a)    Whether the claim is based in contract, tort, or another 
              cause of action, the Contractor is fully liable for all 
              damages to Canada, including indirect, special or 
              consequential damages, caused by the Contractor's performance 
              or failure to perform the Contract that relate to:

                     (i)    any infringement of intellectual property 
                     rights;

                     (ii)   any breach of confidentiality; 
                     
                     (iii)  any breach of warranty obligations; and

                     (iv)   physical injury, including death.

       (b)    The Contractor is liable for all direct damages affecting 
              real or personal property owned, possessed, or occupied by 
              Canada.

       (c)    The Contractor is liable for all direct damages relating to 
              any encumbrance or claim relating to any portion of the Work 
              for which Canada has made any payment.

       (d)    The Contractor is also liable, up to __________, for any 
              other direct damages to Canada in any way relating to the 
              Contract, including all the costs to Canada associated with 
              reprocuring the Work from another party if the Contract is 
              terminated for default. These costs include any increase in 
              the price payable for the Work.

       (e)    If Canada's records or data are harmed as a result of the 
              performance of or failure to perform the Work, the 
              Contractor's only liability is, at the Contractor's own 
              expense, to restore Canada's records and data using the most 
              recent back-up kept by Canada.

4.     <strong>Third Party Claims</strong>: Each Party agrees that it is fully liable for 
       any damages that it causes to any third party in connection with the 
       Contract, regardless of whether the third party makes its claim 
       against Canada or the Contractor.  If Canada is required, as a 
       result of joint and several liability, to pay a third party in 
       respect of damages caused by the Contractor, the Contractor must 
       reimburse Canada for that amount.  However, the Contractor is not 
       liable for reimbursing Canada for any special, indirect or 
       consequential damages that Canada is required by a court to pay to a 
       third party as a result of joint and several liability.
