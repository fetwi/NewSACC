<pre>Proposed Structure:

All work contracted or sub-contracted for this project must be performed at 
the premises of a Canadian based firm, utilizing Canadian citizens and/or 
landed immigrants. Any work sub-contracted outside Canada will be outside 
the terms and conditions of the proposed contract and will not be accepted.

If a company proposes to sub-contract with other firms for the purpose of 
presenting a proposal, the names of all the firms must be stated and the 
division of work between the companies shall be described in detail. Only 
one of the companies in such joint arrangement shall be the prime 
Contractor and shall negotiate and sign all contracts and take full 
responsibility for the project.

In the proposal, the proposer must outline the manner in which it would 
   manage the project. If there is a joint arrangement, full details must 
   be provided concerning liaison between the various companies and the 
   prime Contractor, liaison between the prime Contractor and the Project 
   Authority or the Contracting Authority and what coordination and control 
   procedures would be implemented to ensure the execution of all phases of 
   the work.
