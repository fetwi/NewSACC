days following the end of the acceptance testing period referred to
in that subsection. Upon receipt of Canada's description of the
deficiencies, the Contractor must modify the Custom Software to
correct the deficiencies within ten (10) days of receipt of such
description. All acceptance tests in relation to the Custom
Software must then be repeated, at no additional cost to Canada,
and the Contractor must ensure that the Custom Software passes the
second set of acceptance tests within the acceptance testing period
specified in subsection 4.</li>
<li value="6">Despite anything else contained in this section, if
Canada is unable to commence or continue the acceptance tests in
relation to the Custom Software because of an event reasonably
beyond its control, the acceptance tests may be temporarily
suspended for a period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days. The
time limits for testing referred to in this section or elsewhere in
the Contract will in such cases be extended by the number of days
of the suspension. If the delay exceeds sixty (60) days, the
Parties must use reasonable efforts to negotiate a mutually
acceptable amendment to the Contract.</li>

to the Custom Software. If Canada reports a failure to the
Contractor, Canada must give the Contractor reasonable access to
the computer system on which the Custom Software resides and
provide such information as the Contractor may reasonably request,
including sample output and other information, in order to permit
the Contractor to expeditiously correct the error which caused that
failure.</li>
<li value="4">Although the Contractor must use all reasonable
efforts to provide permanent corrections for all software errors,
Canada acknowledges that certain errors may not be permanently
corrected by the Contractor under this section. The Contractor must
provide a software patch or by-pass around the error in all cases
where the error will not be permanently corrected. As a minimum,
any such software patch or by-pass must cause the Custom Software
to meet the functional and performance criteria set out in the
Functional Specifications.</li>
<li value="5">The Contractor is not obligated to correct errors in
the Custom Software which result from modifications to the Custom
Software or any part of it unless those modifications were made by
