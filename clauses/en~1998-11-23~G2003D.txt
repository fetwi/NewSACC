<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>The contractor must have Product Liability insurance where product expertise is 
a requirement of the contract and the nature of the contract introduces a 
reasonable element of risk to Canada or other third parties.

If either the procurement officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $1,000,000 per accident or occurrence is not 
sufficient, the suggested limit should be established in consultation with the 
client concerned and the Department of Public Works and Government Services' 
Risk Management and Insurance Advisor.
