The Contractor is responsible for performing or having performed all 
inspections and tests necessary to substantiate that the materiel or 
services provided conform to the drawings, specifications and  the 
requirements of the contract.  The Contractor must keep accurate and 
complete inspection records which must, upon request, be made available to

Despite the above, all materiel is subject to verification and acceptance 
by DND at destination.  The authorized DND representative at destination 
may either be the consignee(s), the Technical Authority, or the Quality 
Assurance Authority.
