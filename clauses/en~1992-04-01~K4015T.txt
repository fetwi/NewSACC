<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in respect of 
which the requisition is subject to the Science &amp; Technology Contracting-Out 
Policy, every response must include a certification of Canadian Content (that 
is, the competition is being limited solely to bids qualifying for inclusion in 
Priority Group 1), and the procurement officer is setting a minimum percentage, 
of that part of the bid price which must consist of Canadian goods and/or 
services for the bid to qualify for the first priority group, of other than 80 
percent. See SPM Directive 3010.  
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Bidder represents and warrants that, of the goods and/or services being 
offered to Canada, no less than ____ percent of the bid price consists of 
goods and services of Canadian origin, and that the bid therefore qualifies 
for inclusion in Priority Group 1 as defined in DSS's Supply Policy Manual 
Directive 3010.

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation 
and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any contract resulting from 
this bid. Such representation and warranty may be verified in such manner 
as the Minister may reasonably require.

Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such covenant, 
the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting from this 
bid as being in default.

Failure to include this representation and warranty with the bid by 
executing the signature block immediately following this paragraph shall 
render the bid non-responsive.
