<h2>2010B 02 (2008-05-12) Standard Clauses and Conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 16, the clauses and conditions
identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2>2010B 03 (2008-05-12) Powers of Canada</h2>
<p>All rights, remedies, powers and discretions granted or acquired
by Canada under the Contract or by law are cumulative, not
exclusive.</p>
<h2>2010B 04 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent contractor engaged by Canada to
perform the Work. Nothing in the Contract is intended to create a
partnership, a joint venture or an agency between Canada and the
other Party or Parties. The Contractor must not represent itself as
an agent or representative of Canada to anyone. Neither the
Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee or
agent of Canada. The Contractor is responsible for all deductions
and remittances required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2>2010B 05 (2012-03-02) Conduct of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor represents and warrants that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">it is competent to perform the Work;</li>
<li value="2">it has everything necessary to perform the Work,
including the resources, facilities, labour, technology, equipment,
and materials; and</li>
<li value="3">it has the necessary qualifications, including
knowledge, skill, know-how and experience, and the ability to use
them effectively to perform the Work.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">perform the Work diligently and efficiently;</li>
<li value="2">except for Government Property, supply everything
necessary to perform the Work;</li>
<li value="3">use, as a minimum, quality assurance procedures,
inspections and controls generally used and recognized by the
industry to ensure the degree of quality required by the
Contract;</li>
<li value="4">select and employ a sufficient number of qualified
people;</li>
<li value="5">perform the Work in accordance with standards of
quality acceptable to Canada and in full conformity with the
specifications and all the requirements of the Contract;</li>
<li value="6">provide effective and efficient supervision to ensure
that the quality of workmanship meets the requirements of the
Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">The Work must not be performed by any person who, in the opinion of Canada, is incompetent, unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 06 (2013-06-27) Subcontracts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor may subcontract the supply of goods or
services that are customarily subcontracted by the Contractor. In
any other instance, the Contractor must obtain the prior consent in
writing of the Contracting Authority. The Contracting Authority may
require the Contractor to provide such particulars of the proposed
subcontract as he considers necessary.</li>
<li value="2">Subcontracting does not relieve the Contractor from
any of its obligations under the Contract or impose any liability
upon Canada to a subcontractor.</li>
<li value="3">In any subcontract, the Contractor agrees to bind the
subcontractor by the same conditions by which the Contractor is
bound under the Contract, unless the Contracting Authority requires
or agrees otherwise, with the exception of requirements under the Federal Contractors Program for employment equity which only apply to the Contractor.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 07 (2008-05-12) Time of the Essence</h2>
<p>It is essential that the Work be performed within or at the time
stated in the Contract.</p>
<h2>2010B 08 (2008-05-12) Excusable Delay</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any
obligation under the Contract that is caused by an event that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">is beyond the reasonable control of the
Contractor;</li>
<li value="2">could not reasonably have been foreseen;</li>
<li value="3">could not reasonably have been prevented by means
reasonably available to the Contractor; and</li>
<li value="4">occurred without the fault or neglect of the
Contractor,</li>
</ol>
<p>will be considered an "Excusable Delay" if the Contractor
advises the Contracting Authority of the occurrence of the delay or
of the likelihood of the delay as soon as the Contractor becomes
aware of it. The Contractor must also advise the Contracting
Authority, within fifteen (15) working days, of all the
circumstances relating to the delay and provide to the Contracting
Authority for approval a clear work around plan explaining in
detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to
minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Any delivery date or other date that is directly
affected by an Excusable Delay will be postponed for a reasonable
time that will not exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="3">However, if an Excusable Delay has continued for
thirty (30) days or more, the Contracting Authority may, by giving
notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the Contract. In
such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim
against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other
loss arising out of the termination or the event that contributed
to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately
to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated
at the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Unless Canada has caused the delay by failing to meet
an obligation under the Contract, Canada will not be responsible
for any costs incurred by the Contractor or any of its
subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 09 (2008-05-12) Inspection and Acceptance of the
Work</h2>
<p>All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada.
Inspection and acceptance of the Work by Canada do not relieve the
Contractor of its responsibility for defects or other failures to
meet the requirements of the Contract. Canada will have the right
to reject any work that is not in accordance with the requirements
of the Contract and require its correction or replacement at the
Contractor's expense.</p>
<h2>2010B 10 (2013-03-21) Invoice Submission</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name.
The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment;
invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must
indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</li>
<li value="2">Invoices must show:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the date, the name and address of the client
department, item or reference numbers, deliverable/description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number
(CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial
code(s);</li>
<li value="2">details of expenditures (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price, fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as applicable) in accordance with the Basis of Payment, exclusive of Applicable Taxes;</li>
<li value="3">deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li value="5">if applicable, the method of shipment together with
date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Applicable Taxes must be specified on all invoices as a separate item along with corresponding registration numbers from the tax authorities.  All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which Applicable Taxes do not apply, must be identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li value="4">By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 11 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">
Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes.
</li>
<li value="2">
Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section.  It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation.  The Contractor agrees to remit to appropriate tax authorities any amounts of Applicable Taxes paid or due.
</li>
<li value="3">
The Contractor is not entitled to use Canada’s exemptions from any tax, such as provincial sales taxes, unless otherwise specified by law.  The Contractor must pay applicable provincial sales tax, ancillary taxes, and any commodity tax, on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with applicable legislation), including for material incorporated into real property. 
</li>
<li value="4">
In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award.  However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change. 
</li>
<li value="5">Tax Withholding of 15 Percent – Canada Revenue Agency 
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite>Income Tax Regulations</cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite>Canada Revenue Agency.</cite> The amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.</p>
<h2>2010B 12 (2010-01-11) Transportation Costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2>2010B 13 (2010-01-11) Transportation Carriers' Liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2>2010B 14 (2008-05-12) Payment Period</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada's standard payment period is thirty (30) days.
The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31<sup>st</sup> day following that date and interest
will be paid automatically in accordance with the section 15.</li>
<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within fifteen (15) days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 15 (2008-12-12) Interest on Overdue Accounts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">For the purpose of this section:
<p>"<dfn>Average Rate</dfn>" means the simple arithmetic mean of the
Bank Rates in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time each day during the
calendar month immediately before the calendar month in which
payment is made;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Bank Rate</dfn>" means the rate of interest established from
time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the
Bank of Canada makes short term advances to members of the Canadian
Payments Association;</p>
<p>"<dfn>date of payment</dfn>" means the date of the negotiable
instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada to pay any
amount under the Contract;</p>
<p>an amount becomes "<dfn>overdue</dfn>" when it is unpaid on the first day
following the day on which it is due and payable according to the
Contract.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Canada will pay to the Contractor simple interest at
the Average Rate plus 3 percent per year on any amount that is
overdue, from the date that amount becomes overdue until the day
before the date of payment, inclusive. The Contractor is not
required to provide notice to Canada for interest to be
payable.</li>
<li value="3">Canada will pay interest in accordance with this
section only if Canada is responsible for the delay in paying the
Contractor. Canada will not pay interest on overdue advance
payments.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 16 (2008-05-12) Audit</h2>
<p>The amount claimed under the Contract is subject to government
audit both before and after payment is made. The Contractor must
keep proper accounts and records of the cost of performing the Work
and keep all documents relating to such cost for six (6) years
after it receives the final payment under the Contract.</p>
<h2>2010B 17 (2008-05-12) Compliance with Applicable Laws</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must comply with all laws applicable
to the performance of the Contract. The Contractor must provide
evidence of compliance with such laws to Canada at such times as
Canada may reasonably request.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must obtain and maintain at its own
cost all permits, licenses, regulatory approvals and certificates
required to perform the Work. If requested by the Contracting
Authority, the Contractor must provide a copy of any required
permit, license, regulatory approvals or certificate to
Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 18 (2008-05-12) Confidentiality</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must keep confidential all information
provided to the Contractor by or on behalf of Canada in connection
with the Work and all information conceived, developed or produced
by the Contractor as part of the Work. Information provided to the
Contractor by or on behalf of Canada must be used solely for the
purpose of the Contract and remains the property of Canada.</li>
<li value="2">Subject to the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>
,<abbr title="Revised Statutes of Canada">R.S.C.</abbr> 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> A-1, and to any right of Canada under
the Contract to release or disclose, Canada agrees not to release

Contractor or a subcontractor.</li>
<li value="3">The obligations of the Parties set out in this
section do not apply to any information where the same information:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">is publicly available from a source other than the
other Party; or</li>
<li value="2">is or becomes known to a Party from a source other
than the other Party, except any source that is known to be under
an obligation to the other Party not to disclose the information,
or</li>
<li value="3">is developed by a Party without use of the
information of the other Party.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 19 (2012-07-16) Copyright</h2>

at such other time as the Contracting Authority may require, a
written permanent waiver of moral rights as defined in the
<cite>Copyright Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> C-42, in a form
acceptable to the Contracting Authority, from every author that
contributed to the Work. If the Contractor is an author, the
Contractor permanently waives the Contractor's moral rights.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 20 (2008-05-12) Government Property</h2>
<p>The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care of all
Government Property while it is in its possession or subject to its
control. The Contractor is responsible for any loss or damage

caused by ordinary wear and tear.</p>
<h2>2010B 21 (2008-05-12) Amendment</h2>
<p>To be effective, any amendment to the Contract must be done in
writing by the Contracting Authority and the authorized
representative of the Contractor.</p>
<h2>2010B 22 (2008-05-12) Assignment</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must not assign the Contract without
first obtaining the written consent of the Contracting Authority.
Any assignment made without that consent is void and will have no
effect. The assignment will be effective upon execution of an
assignment agreement signed by the Parties and the assignee.</li>
<li value="2">Assignment of the Contract does not relieve the
Contractor from any obligation under the Contract and it does not
impose any liability upon Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 23 (2008-05-12) Suspension of the Work</h2>
<p>The Contracting Authority may at any time, by written notice,
order the Contractor to suspend or stop the Work or part of the
Work under the Contract. The Contractor must immediately comply
with any such order in a way that minimizes the cost of doing
so.</p>
<h2>2010B 24 (2008-05-12) Default by the Contractor</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any
of its obligations under the Contract, the Contracting Authority
may, by giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate for
default the Contract or part of the Contract. The termination will
take effect immediately or at the expiration of a cure period
specified in the notice, if the Contractor has not cured the
default to the satisfaction of the Contracting Authority within
that cure period.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent,
makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the
benefit of any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors,
or if a receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a
receiving order is made against the Contractor, or an order is made
or a resolution passed for the winding down of the Contractor, the
Contracting Authority may, to the extent permitted by the laws of
Canada, by giving written notice to the Contractor, immediately
terminate for default the Contract or part of the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">If Canada gives notice under subsection 1 or 2, the
Contractor will have no claim for further payment except as
provided in this section. The Contractor will be liable to Canada
for all losses and damages suffered by Canada because of the
default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including
any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work
from another source. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to
Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at
the date of the termination.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2010B 25 (2012-07-16) Termination for Convenience</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">At any time before the completion of the Work, the
Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the
Contractor, terminate for convenience the Contract or part of the
Contract. Once such a notice of termination for convenience is
given, the Contractor must comply with the requirements of the
termination notice. If the Contract is terminated in part only, the
Contractor must proceed to complete any part of the Work that is
not affected by the termination notice. The termination will take
effect immediately or, as the case may be, at the time specified in
the termination notice.</li>
<li value="2">If a termination notice is given pursuant to
subsection 1, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid, for costs
that have been reasonably and properly incurred to perform the
Contract to the extent that the Contractor has not already been
paid or reimbursed by Canada. The Contractor will be paid:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">on the basis of the Contract Price, for all completed
work that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the
Contract, whether completed before, or after the termination in
accordance with the instructions contained in the termination
notice;</li>
<li value="2">the Cost to the Contractor plus a fair and reasonable
profit for all work terminated by the termination notice before
completion; and</li>
<li value="3">all costs incidental to the termination of the Work
incurred by the Contractor but not including the cost of severance
payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer
required, except wages that the Contractor is obligated by statute
to pay.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Canada may reduce the payment in respect of any part
of the Work, if upon inspection, it does not meet the requirements
of the Contract.</li>
<li value="4">The total of the amounts, to which the Contractor is
entitled to be paid under this section, together with any amounts
paid, due or becoming due to the Contractor must not exceed the

</ol>
<h2>2010B 26 (2008-05-12) Right of Set-off</h2>
<p>Without restricting any right of set-off given by law, Canada
may set-off against any amount payable to the Contractor under the
Contract, any amount payable to Canada by the Contractor under the
Contract or under any other current contract. Canada may, when
making a payment pursuant to the Contract, deduct from the amount
payable to the Contractor any such amount payable to Canada by the
Contractor which, by virtue of the right of set-off, may be
retained by Canada.</p>
<h2>2010B 27 (2008-05-12) Conflict of Interest and Values and
Ethics Codes for the Public Service</h2>
<p>The Contractor acknowledges that individuals who are subject to
the provisions of the <cite>Conflict of Interest Act</cite>, 2006,

organizations cannot derive any direct benefit resulting from the
Contract.</p>
<h2>2010B 28 (2008-05-12) No Bribe or Conflict</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor declares that no bribe, gift, benefit,
or other inducement has been or will be paid, given, promised or
offered directly or indirectly to any official or employee of
Canada or to a member of the family of such a person, with a view
to influencing the entry into the Contract or the administration of
the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must not influence, seek to influence
or otherwise take part in a decision of Canada knowing that the
decision might further its private interest. The Contractor must
have no financial interest in the business of a third party that
causes or would appear to cause a conflict of interest in
connection with the performance of its obligations under the
Contract. If such a financial interest is acquired during the
period of the Contract, the Contractor must immediately declare it
to the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor warrants that, to the best of its
knowledge after making diligent inquiry, no conflict exists or is
likely to arise in the performance of the Contract. In the event
the Contractor becomes aware of any matter that causes or is likely
to cause a conflict in relation to the Contractor's performance
under the Contract, the Contractor must immediately disclose such
matter to the Contracting Authority in writing.</li>
<li value="4">If the Contracting Authority is of the opinion that a
conflict exists as a result of the Contractor's disclosure or as a
result of any other information brought to the Contracting
Authority's attention, the Contracting Authority may require the
Contractor to take steps to resolve or otherwise deal with the
conflict or, at its entire discretion, terminate the Contract for
default. Conflict means any matter, circumstance, interest, or
activity affecting the Contractor, its personnel or subcontractors,
which may or may appear to impair the ability of the Contractor to
perform the Work diligently and independently.</li>
