subject to audit.  The audit will determine if the total price charged by 
the Contractor on a single contract, where only one exists, or a series of 
negotiated firm price contracts, where more than one exists, is in 
accordance with the procedures.

If the audit demonstrates that the certification is in error after payment 
is made to the Contractor, the Contractor must, at the discretion of Canada, 
refund any overpayment or authorize the retention by Canada of the 
overpayment by way of deduction from any sum of money that may be due or 
payable to the Contractor pursuant to the Contract.

If the audit demonstrates that the certification is in error before payment 
is made, the Contractor agrees that any pending invoice will be adjusted by 
Canada in accordance with the results of the audit.  It is further agreed 
that if the Contract is still in effect at the time of the verification, 
the price will be lowered in accordance with the results of the audit.
