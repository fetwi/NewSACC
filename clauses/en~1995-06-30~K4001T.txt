<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in which the 
Canadian Content policy is applicable (see Supply Manual) and where competition 
is being solely limited to bids offering Canadian goods and/or services.  This 
clause is to be used for single item requirements and multi-item requirements 
that are being certified on an aggregate basis.  This clause must be used in 
conjunction with clause K4000D - Canadian Content Definition.
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Bidder represents and warrants that, of the goods and services being 
offered to Canada, no less than 80 percent of the bid price consists of 
Canadian goods and Canadian services as defined in clause K4000D - Canadian 
Content Definition.

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation 
and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any contract resulting from 
this bid. Such representation and warranty of Canadian Content may be 
verified in such manner as the Minister may reasonably require.

Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such covenant, 
the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting from this 
bid as being in default.

Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature block 
immediately following this paragraph or to include it with the bid may 
render the bid non-responsive.
