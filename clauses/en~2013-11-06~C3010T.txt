<li value="1">The Bidder may request Canada to assume the risks and benefits of exchange rate fluctuations.  If the Bidder claims for an exchange rate adjustment, this request must be clearly indicated in the bid at time of bidding.  The Bidder must submit form PWGSC-TPSGC 450, Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments with its bid, indicating the Foreign Currency Component (FCC) in Canadian dollars for each line item for which an exchange rate adjustment is required. </li>
<li value="2">The <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> is defined as the portion of the price or rate that will be directly affected by exchange rate fluctuations.  The <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> should  include all related taxes, duties and other costs paid by the Bidder and which are to be included in the adjustment amount.</li>
<li value="3">The total price paid by Canada on each invoice will be adjusted at the time of payment, based on the <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> and the exchange rate fluctuation provision in the contract.  The exchange rate adjustment will only be applied where the exchange rate fluctuation is greater than 2% (increase or decrease). </li>
<li value="4">At time of bidding, the Bidder must complete columns (1) to (4) on form PWGSC-TPSGC 450, for each line item where they want to invoke the exchange rate fluctuation provision.  Where bids are evaluated in Canadian dollars, the dollar values provided in column (3) should also be in Canadian dollars, so that the adjustment amount is in the same currency as the payment.</li>
