<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor warrants that all electronic processing systems 
       contained within or forming part of goods delivered under this 
       Contract, shall meet the contractual requirement so as to accurately 
       and automatically process any and all date and date-related data 
       including, but not limited to calculating, comparing, and sequencing 
       of such data from, into, and between the twentieth and twenty-first 
       centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000, and that such date-related 
       processing will take into consideration leap year calculations when 
       used in accordance with the documentation provided by the Contractor 
       and accepted by Canada.

2.     The items under warranty include but are not limited to:

       - processors
       - memory (RAM, ROM, PROM, EPROM, etc.)
       - firmware or software
       - reliant systems or architecture
       - integrated circuits.

3.     To that end, the Contractor also warrants that date-related 
       processing will not, in any way, prevent  the goods from conforming 
       to the requirement of the Contract prior to, during, or after the 
       year 2000.  Canada may, at no additional cost, require the 
       Contractor, at time of acceptance, to demonstrate compliance and/or 
       compliance techniques and test procedures it  followed in order to 
       comply with all of the obligations contained herein.

4.     The obligations contained herein apply to the products delivered by 
       the Contractor and its subcontractor(s) involved in the performance 
       of this Contract.

5.     The warranties contained herein are separate and discrete from any 
       other warranties specified in this Contract, and are not subject to 
       any disclaimer of warranty that may be specified in this Contract, 
       its appendices, its schedules, its annexes or any document 
       incorporated in this Contract by reference.

6.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set out in the 
       applicable Supplemental General Conditions, if any, under the 
       section entitled "Warranty" apply. 
7.     The warranties contained herein shall have a term extending either:
       (a)    to June 30, 2000, or,
       (b)    for a period of six months following acceptance of the 
              hardware, software and/or firmware,

       whichever is the later date.
