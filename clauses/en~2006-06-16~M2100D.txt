<pre>1.     Persons in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada, are bound by 
       economic sanctions imposed by Canada.  As a result, the Government 
       of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services that originate, 
       either directly or indirectly, from the countries or persons subject 
       to economic sanctions.

       Details on existing sanctions can be found at:

2.     It is a condition of this Standing Offer and of any ensuing call-ups, 
       if any, that the Offeror not supply to the Government of Canada any 
       goods or services which are subject to economic sanctions.

3.     By law, the Offeror must comply with changes to the regulations 
   imposed during the life of the Standing Offer.  During the performance 
   of any call-up under the Standing Offer, should the imposition of 
   sanctions against a country or person or the addition of a good or 
   service to the list of sanctioned goods and services prevent the Offeror 
   from performing all or part of its obligations pursuant to a call-up 
   made against this Standing Offer, the Offeror shall treat the situation 
   as a force majeure.  The Offeror shall forthwith inform Canada of the 
   situation; the procedures applicable to force majeure shall then apply.
