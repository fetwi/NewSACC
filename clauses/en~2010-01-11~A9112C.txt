<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<p>The Contractor warrants that it is not under common ownership
control of another division, parent company or affiliate supplying
materials and/or services in connection with the performance of the
Work under the Contract. For the purposes of this warranty, the
phrase <dfn>"ownership control"</dfn> means that at least 50 percent
of the voting rights are held by the related entity.</p>
<p>The Contractor acknowledges that Canada has relied on the
warranty in establishing the price payable under the Contract. In
the event of breach of such warranty, Canada will have the right to
terminate the Contract for default or, alternatively, the right to
readjust the price to reflect the level of profit payable under
departmental policy when common ownership control exists, as set
out in the Department of Public Works and Government Services
Transfer Pricing Policy published in Chapter 10 of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>.</p>
