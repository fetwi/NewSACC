<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor must not provide a domestic or international aircraft 
       charter service to Canada unless, for every incident related to the 
       Contractor's operation of that service, it has:

       (a)    liability insurance covering risks of injury to or death of 
              passengers in an amount that is not less than the amount 
              determined by multiplying $300,000 by the number of passenger 
              seats on board the aircraft engaged in the service, or in 
              accordance with the applicable regulations, whichever is 
              greater;

       (b)    in addition to passenger liability limits in (a) above, 
              insurance covering risks of public liability in an amount 
              that is not less than:

              (i)    $1,000,000, where the maximum permissible take-off 
                     weight of the aircraft less than 3,402 kg (7,500 
                     pounds);

              (ii)   $2,000,000, where the maximum permissible take-off 
                     weight of the aircraft is between 3,402 kg (7,500 
                     pounds) and 8,165kg (18,000 pounds); and,

              (iii)  $2,000,000 plus an amount determined by multiplying $68 
                     by the number of kilograms by which the maximum 
                     permissible take-off weight of the aircraft exceeds 8,165 
                     kg (18,000 pounds), where the maximum permissible 
                     take-off weight of the aircraft is over 8,165 kg.

2.     The insurance coverage required by subsection 1.(a) does not need  
       to extend to any passenger who is an employee of the Contractor if 
       workers' compensation legislation governing a claim for damages 
       against that Contractor by the employee is applicable.

3.     The Contractor's insurance must include the following:

       (a)    Additional Insured: Canada is added as an additional insured, 
              but only with respect to liability arising out of the 
              Contractor's performance of the Contract. The interest of 
              Canada as additional insured should read as follows: Canada, 
              represented by Public Works and Government Services Canada.

       (b)    Notice of Cancellation:  The Insurer will endeavour to 
              provide the Contracting Authority thirty (30) days written 
              notice of cancellation.

       (c)    Cross Liability/Separation of Insureds:  Without increasing 
              the limit of liability, the policy must protect all insured 
              parties to the full extent of coverage provided.  Further, 
              the policy must apply to each Insured in the same manner and 
              to the same extent as if a separate policy had been issued to 
              each.

       (d)    Contractual Liability:  The policy must, on a blanket basis 
              or by specific reference to the contract, extend to assumed 
              liabilities with respect to contractual obligations.

       (<span class="wsInlineRemark"><strong>Contracting officers must insert the following option, if 
       applicable.</strong></span>)

       (e)    Litigation Rights:  Pursuant to subsection 5(d) of the <em>
              Department of Justice Act</em>, S.C. 1993, c. J-2, s.1, if a suit 
              is instituted for or against Canada which the Insurer would, 
              but for this clause, have the right to pursue or defend on 
              behalf of Canada as an Additional Named Insured under the 
              insurance policy, the Insurer must promptly contact the 
              Attorney General of Canada to agree on the legal strategies 
              by sending a letter, by registered mail or by courier, with 
              an acknowledgement of receipt.

              For the province of Quebec, send to: 
              Director Business Law Directorate,
              Quebec Regional Office (Ottawa), 
              Department of Justice, 
              284 Wellington Street, Room SAT-6042, 
              Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0H8 

              For other provinces and territories, send to:
              Senior General Counsel, 
              Civil Litigation Section,
              Department of Justice
              234 Wellington Street, East Tower 
              Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

       A copy of the letter must be sent to the Contracting Authority. 
       Canada reserves the right to co-defend any action brought against 
       Canada.  All expenses incurred by Canada to co-defend such actions 
       will be at Canada's expense. If Canada decides to co-defend any 
       action brought against it, and Canada does not agree to a proposed 
       settlement agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and the plaintiff(s) 
       that would result in the settlement or dismissal of the action 
       against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the Contractor's 
       insurer for any difference between the proposed settlement amount 
       and the amount finally awarded or paid to the plaintiffs (inclusive 
       of costs and interest) on behalf of Canada.
