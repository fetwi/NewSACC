The Bidder must comply with the Policy and Directives, which can be found at <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em>. </li>
<li>Under the Policy, charges and convictions of certain offences against a Supplier, its affiliates or first tier subcontractors, and other circumstances, will or may result in a determination by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) that the Supplier is ineligible to enter, or is suspended from entering into a contract with Canada. The list of ineligible and suspended Suppliers is contained in <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Integrity Database.

<li>with its bid, a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy. The list of foreign criminal charges and convictions must be submitted using an Integrity Declaration Form, which can be found at Declaration form for procurement.</li>

<li>it has provided with its bid a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy;</li>
