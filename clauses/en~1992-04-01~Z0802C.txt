<p class="description">The following replaces paragraph (g) of clause Z0801C.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="7">Limited risk of loss.
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The term "<dfn>Contractor's managerial personnel</dfn>", as used
in this paragraph (g), means the Contractor's directors, officers,
and any of the Contractor's managers, superintendents, or
equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">all or substantially all of the Contractor's
business;</li>
<li value="2">all or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at
any one plant or separate location at which the Contract is being
performed; or</li>
<li value="3">a separate and complete major industrial operation
connected with performing this Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor shall not be liable for loss or
destruction of, or damage to, the Government property provided
under this Contract (or, if an educational or nonprofit
organization, for expenses incidental to such loss, destruction, or
damage), except as provided in subparagraphs 3. and 4. below.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor shall be responsible for loss or
destruction of, or damage to, the Government property provided
under this Contract (including expenses incidental to such loss,
destruction, or damage):
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">that results from a risk expressly required to be
insured under this Contract, but only to the extent of the
insurance required to be purchased and maintained, or to the extent
of insurance actually purchased and maintained, whichever is
greater;</li>
<li value="2">that results from a risk that is in fact covered by
insurance or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but
only to the extent of such insurance or reimbursement;</li>
<li value="3">for which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under
the express terms of this Contract;</li>
<li value="4">that results from wilful misconduct or lack of good faith
on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or</li>

Contractor, due to wilful misconduct or lack of good faith on the
part of the Contractor's managerial personnel, to establish and
administer a program or system for the control, use, protection,
preservation, maintenance, and repair of Government property as
required by paragraph (e) of clause Z0801C.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">If the Contractor fails to act as provided in
subdivision 3.(v) above, after being notified (by certified mail
addressed to one of the Contractor's managerial personnel) of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>'s
or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government's disapproval, withdrawal of approval, or
nonacceptance of the system or program, it shall be conclusively
presumed that such failure was due to wilful misconduct or lack of
good faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel.</li>
<li value="2">In such event, any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
the Government property shall be presumed to have resulted from
such failure, unless the Contractor can establish by clear and
convincing evidence that such loss, destruction, or damage
<ol type="A">
<li value="1">did not result from the Contractor's failure to maintain an
approved program or system; or</li>
<li value="2">occurred while an approved program or system was maintained
by the Contractor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">If the Contractor transfers Government property to
the possession and control of a subcontractor, the transfer shall
not affect the liability of the Contractor for loss or destruction
of, or damage to, the property as set forth above. However, the
Contractor shall require the subcontractor to assume the risk of,
and be responsible for, any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
the property while in the subcontractor's possession or control,
except to the extent that the subcontract, with the advance
approval of the Contracting Officer, relieves the subcontractor
from such liability. In the absence of such approval, the
subcontract shall contain appropriate provisions requiring the
return of all Government property in as good condition as when
received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for its use in
accordance with the provisions of the prime Contract.</li>
<li value="6">Upon loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government
property provided under this Contract, the Contractor shall so
notify the Contracting Officer and shall communicate with the loss
and salvage organization, if any, designated by the Contracting
Officer. With the assistance of any such organization, the
Contractor shall take all reasonable action to protect the
Government property from further damage, separate the damaged and
undamaged Government property, put all the affected Government
property in the best possible order, and furnish to the Contracting
Officer a statement of
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the lost, destroyed or damaged Government
property;</li>
<li value="2">the time and origin of the loss, destruction, or
damage;</li>
<li value="3">all known interests in commingled property of which the
Government property is a part; and</li>
<li value="4">the insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in
such commingled property.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="7">The Contractor shall repair, renovate, and take such
other action with respect to damaged Government property as the
Contracting Officer directs. If the Government property is
destroyed or damaged beyond practical repair, or is damaged and so
commingled or combined with property of others (including the
Contractor's) that separation is impractical, the Contractor may,
with the approval of and subject to any conditions imposed by the
Contracting Officer, sell such property for the account of the
Government. Such sales may be made in order to minimize the loss to
the Government, to permit the resumption of business, or to
accomplish a similar purpose. The Contractor shall be entitled to
an equitable adjustment in the Contract Price for the expenditure
made in performing the obligations under this subparagraph (g) 7.
in accordance with paragraph (h) of clause Z0801C. However, the Government may directly
reimburse the loss and salvage organization for any of their
charges. The Contracting Officer shall give due regard to the
Contractor's liability under this paragraph (g) when making such
equitable adjustment.</li>
<li value="8">The Contractor represents that it is not including in
the price, and agrees it will not hereafter include in any price to
<abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, any charge or reserve for insurance (including any
self-insurance fund or reserve) covering loss or detection of, or
damage to, Government property, except to the extent that <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may
have expressly required the Contractor to carry such insurance
under another provision of this Contract.</li>
<li value="9">In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or
otherwise compensated for any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
Government property, the Contractor shall use the proceeds to
repair, renovate, or replace the lost, destroyed, or damaged
Government property, or shall otherwise credit the proceeds to
equitably reimburse <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, as directed by the Contracting
Officer.</li>
<li value="10">The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or
the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government's rights to recover against third parties for
any loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property. Upon
the request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall, at
the expense of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government, furnish to that party
all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment
in favour of that party) in obtaining recovery. In addition, where
a subcontractor has not been relieved from liability for any loss
or destruction of, or damage to, Government property, the
Contractor shall enforce for the benefit of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
Government the liability of the subcontractor for such loss,
destruction, or damage.</li>
