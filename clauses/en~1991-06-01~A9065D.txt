<pre>As a security precaution, it is required that all employees engaged in work 
   or business for the Contract be readily identifiable.  To this end, all 
   company workmen, foremen, and subcontractor personnel are to wear, in a 
   conspicuous place, the identification badge issued to them.  In addition, 
   it is recommended that a corresponding number be painted on the front of 
   the safety helmet worn.
