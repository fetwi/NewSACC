       delivery requirements set forth herein, it is recognized that the 
       Contractor, as of _____ (start date), has incurred certain costs 
       relating directly to the performance of this Contract prior to the 
       effective date of this Contract, which, if they had been incurred 
       after such date, would have been otherwise treated as costs 
       reasonably and properly incurred by the Contractor in the 
       performance of this Contract.  It is recognized by Canada and the

       of these costs was authorized and necessary to comply with the terms 
       of this Contract, such cost shall be treated as costs reasonable and 
       properly incurred by the Contractor in performance of this Contract.
