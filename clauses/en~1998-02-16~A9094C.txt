<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>This clause should be used when a proposed contractor has started work at its 
own risk without the authorization of a government official, prior to contract 
authorization, and the work has not been completed. This will ensure that the 
work done prior to the contract date will be covered by the contract.  If the 
work has been completed, the contracting authority must request that a 
confirming order be prepared by legal counsel.

The second paragraph is to be deleted if the client department does not wish to 
retain the rights to the intellectual property.  In addition, add clause C0210C 
to the Basis of Payment.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     In order to complete the Work called for by the Contract within the 
       delivery requirements set forth herein, it is recognized that the 
       Contractor, as of _____ (start date), has incurred certain costs 
       relating directly to the performance of this Contract prior to the 
       effective date of this Contract, which, if they had been incurred 
       after such date, would have been otherwise treated as costs 
       reasonably and properly incurred by the Contractor in the 
       performance of this Contract.  It is recognized by Canada and the 
       Contractor that the Contractor was authorized in writing by Canada 
       to expend certain amounts otherwise reimbursable under the Contract 
       prior to the effective date of the Contract in order to meet the 
       deliver dates specified in the Contract.  Inasmuch as the incurring 
       of these costs was authorized and necessary to comply with the terms 
       of this Contract, such cost shall be treated as costs reasonable and 
       properly incurred by the Contractor in performance of this Contract.

2.     The parties confirm that ownership of any intellectual property, 
       including technical documentation, prototypes, inventions and 
       technical information, produced by the Contractor in the performance 
       of the Precontractual Work shall vest and remain in Canada.
