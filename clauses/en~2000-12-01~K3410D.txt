<pre>1.     General Conditions DSS-MAS 9624, Research and Development, are 
       amended by deleting the sections entitled "Contractor to Own 
       Foreground Information," "License Rights," "Reconveyance of Title" 
       and "Sale and Licensing of Foreground Information" in their entirety. 
       This section applies in lieu of those sections.

2.     Without divesting the Contractor or any other party of intellectual 
       property rights that have come into being prior to the Contract, 
       copyright, patent and all other intellectual property rights to all 
       Foreground Information shall, immediately upon its conception, 
       development, reduction to practice or production, vest in and remain 
       the property of Canada. The Contractor shall have no right in or to 
       any such Foreground Information except any right that may be granted 
       in writing by Canada.

3.     The Contractor hereby permanently waives its moral rights, as 
       defined in the <em>Copyright Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, to all Technical 
       Information conceived, developed or produced by the Contractor as 
       part of the Work under the Contract, and shall provide to Canada, at 
       the completion of the Contract or at such other time as the Contract 
       or the Minister may require, a written permanent waiver of such 
       moral rights, in a form acceptable to the Minister, from every 
       author who contributed to such Technical Information.

4.     The Contractor shall incorporate the copyright symbol and the 
       following copyright notice into all Foreground Information recorded 
       in any form or medium:

              "Copyright (c) [<strong><em>insert year</em></strong>] Her Majesty the Queen in right 
              of Canada, as represented by the Minister of [<strong><em>insert the name 
              of the department or agency for which the Work is being 
              carried out</em></strong>]"

5.     Where copyright or patent or other intellectual property rights in 
       Technical Information vest in Canada under the Contract, the 
       Contractor shall execute such conveyances or other documents 
       relating to those rights as the minister for whose department or 
       agency the Work is being carried out may require, and the Contractor 
       shall, at Canada's expense, afford that minister all reasonable 
       assistance in the prosecution of any patent application or 
       registration of copyright or an industrial design, including the 
       assistance of the inventor in the case of Inventions.

6.     Unless prior written consent to the contrary is given by the 
       Minister, the Contractor shall not incorporate into the Work any 
       Background Information that would prevent Canada from awarding 
       contracts to other contractors for the alteration, further 
       development or other use of the Foreground Information, or that 
       would otherwise restrict Canada's right to use the Foreground 
       Information in any way Canada deems necessary.

7.     Notwithstanding subsection 6., the Contractor shall not be obligated 
   to seek the Minister's consent to the incorporation of any Background 
   Information that has been specifically identified in the Contract.
