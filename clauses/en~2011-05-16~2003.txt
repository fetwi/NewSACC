<h2>01 Code of Conduct for Procurement</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">To comply with the 
Code of Conduct for Procurement, bidders must respond to bid
solicitations in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner,
accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements
stipulated in the bid solicitation and resulting contract, submit
bids and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all
obligations of the Contract. To ensure fairness, openness and
transparency in the bidding process, the following activities are
prohibited:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">payment of a contingency fee by any party to a
contract to a person to whom the <cite>Lobbying
Act</cite> (1985, c. 44 (4th Supp.)) applies;</li>
<li value="2">corruption, collusion, bid-rigging or any other
anti-competitive activity in the bidding process for contracts for
the provision of goods or services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that
neither the Bidder nor any of the Bidder's Affiliates has ever been
convicted of a criminal offence in respect of the activities stated
in (a) or (b) above or is the subject of outstanding criminal
charges in respect of such activities filed subsequent to September
1, 2010.</li>
<li value="3">Bidders further understand that the commission of
certain offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a
contract. By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that neither
the Bidder nor any of the Bidder's Affiliates has ever been
convicted or is the subject of outstanding criminal charges in
respect of an offence under any of the following provisions:
<p>Section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor
subscribing to election fund</em>), Section 124 (<em>Selling or
Purchasing Office</em>), Section 380 (<em>Fraud committed against
Her Majesty</em>) or Section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to
Her Majesty</em>) of the Criminal Code of Canada, or under
paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>)
subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or Section
154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial
Administration Act</cite>.</p></li>
<li value="4">For the purpose of this section, business concerns,
organizations or individuals are Bidder's Affiliates if, directly
or indirectly, 1) either one controls or has the power to control
the other, or 2) a third party has the power to control both.
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking
management or ownership, identity of interests among family
members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees,
or a business entity created following the charges or convictions
contemplated in this section which has the same or similar
management, ownership, or principal employees as the Bidder that is
charged or convicted, as the case may be.</li>
<li value="5">Except in the limited circumstances set out in
subsection 6 below, the Contracting Authority will declare
non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information
contained in the certifications contemplated above is determined to
be untrue in any respect by the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="6">Subsection 5 has no application in the circumstances
where a bidder has pled guilty of an offence contemplated in
Section 01, 1. (b) and the Bidder has provided with its bid an
assurance from the Competition Bureau of Canada indicating that the
Bidder has been granted leniency, or in the circumstances where the
Bidder provides documentation from the National Parole Board that
the Bidder has obtained a criminal pardon in relation to such
offence.</li>
<li value="7">The Bidder acknowledges and agrees that the
certifications contemplated must remain valid during the period of
any resulting contract arising from this bid solicitation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>02 Procurement Business Number</h2>
<p>Canadian suppliers are required to have a Procurement Business
Number (PBN) before contract award. Suppliers may register for a
PBN online at Supplier Registration
Information. For non-Internet registration, suppliers may
contact the InfoLine at 1-800-811-1148 to obtain the telephone
number of the nearest Supplier Registration Agent.</p>
<h2>03 Standard Instructions, Clauses and Conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public
Works and Government Services Act</cite> (S.C. 1996, c.16), the
instructions, clauses and conditions identified in the bid
solicitation and resulting contract by number, date, and title are
incorporated by reference into and form part of the bid
solicitation and resulting contract as though expressly set out in
the bid solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<h2>04 Definition of Bidder</h2>
<p><dfn>"Bidder"</dfn> means the person or entity (or, in the case of
a joint venture, the persons or entities) submitting a bid to
perform a contract for goods, services or both. It does not include
the parent, subsidiaries or other affiliates of the Bidder, or its
subcontractors.</p>
<h2>05 Submission of Bids</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada requires that each bid, at closing date and
time or upon request from the Contracting Authority, be signed by
the Bidder or by an authorized representative of the Bidder. If a
bid is submitted by a joint venture, it must be in accordance with
Section 17.</li>
<li value="2">It is the Bidder's responsibility to:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">obtain clarification of the requirements contained in
the bid solicitation, if necessary, before submitting a bid;</li>
<li value="2">prepare its bid in accordance with the instructions
contained in the bid solicitation;</li>
<li value="3">submit by closing date and time a complete bid;</li>
<li value="4">send its bid only to Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) Bid Receiving Unit specified on page 1 of
the bid solicitation or to the address specified in the bid
solicitation. The facsimile number and related instructions for
bids transmitted by facsimile are provided in Section 08;</li>
<li value="5">ensure that the Bidder's name, return address, the
bid solicitation number, and bid solicitation closing date and time
are clearly visible on the envelope or the parcel(s) containing the
bid; and,</li>
<li value="6">provide a comprehensible and sufficiently detailed
bid, including all requested pricing details, that will permit a
complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out in the
bid solicitation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">If Canada has provided bidders with multiple formats
of a document (for example, a document may be downloaded through
the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) but may also be
made available on CD-ROM through GETS), the format downloaded
through GETS will take precedence. If Canada posts an amendment to
the bid solicitation revising any documents provided to bidders in
multiple formats, Canada will not necessarily update all formats to
reflect these revisions. It is the Bidder's responsibility to
ensure that revisions made through any bid solicitation amendment
issued through GETS are taken into account in the alternate formats
it uses of bid solicitation documents.</li>
<li value="4">Bids will remain open for acceptance for a period of
not less than sixty (60) days from the closing date of the bid
solicitation, unless specified otherwise in the bid solicitation.
Canada reserves the right to seek an extension of the bid validity
period from all responsive bidders in writing, within a minimum of
three (3) days before the end of the bid validity period. If the
extension is accepted by all responsive bidders, Canada will
continue with the evaluation of the bids. If the extension is not
accepted by all responsive bidders, Canada will, at its sole
discretion, either continue with the evaluation of the bids of
those who have accepted the extension or cancel the
solicitation.</li>
<li value="5">Bid documents and supporting information may be
submitted in either English or French.</li>
<li value="6">Bids received on or before the stipulated bid
solicitation closing date and time will become the property of
Canada and will not be returned. All bids will be treated as
confidential, subject to the provisions of the <cite>
Access to Information Act</cite> (R.S. 1985, c. A-1) and the
<cite>
Privacy Act</cite> (R.S., 1985, c. P-21).</li>
<li value="7">Unless specified otherwise in the bid solicitation,
Canada will evaluate only the documentation provided with a
bidder's bid. Canada will not evaluate information such as
references to Web site addresses where additional information can
be found, or technical manuals or brochures not submitted with the
bid.</li>
<li value="8">A bid cannot be assigned or transferred in whole or
in part.</li>
</ol>
<h2>06 Late Bids</h2>
<p>PWGSC will return bids delivered after the stipulated bid
solicitation closing date and time, unless they qualify as a
delayed bid as described below.</p>
<h2>07 Delayed Bids</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A bid delivered to the specified bid receiving unit
after the closing date and time but before the contract award date
may be considered, provided the bidder can prove the delay is due
solely to a delay in delivery that can be attributed to the Canada
Post Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a foreign
country). Purolator Inc. is not considered to be part of CPC for
the purposes of delayed bids. The only pieces of evidence relating
to a delay in the CPC system that are acceptable to PWGSC are:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">a CPC cancellation date stamp; or</li>
<li value="2">a CPC Priority Courier bill of lading; or</li>
<li value="3">a CPC Xpresspost label</li>
</ol>
<p>that clearly indicates that the bid was mailed before the bid
closing date.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">For bids transmitted by facsimile, only the date,
time and place of receipt recorded by PWGSC will be accepted as
evidence of a delayed bid.</li>
<li value="3">Misrouting, traffic volume, weather disturbances,
labour disputes or any other causes for the late delivery of bids
are not acceptable reasons for the bid to be accepted by
PWGSC.</li>
<li value="4">Postage meter imprints, whether imprinted by the
Bidder, the CPC or the postal authority outside Canada, are not
acceptable as proof of timely mailing.</li>
</ol>
<h2>08 Transmission by Facsimile</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Unless specified otherwise in the bid solicitation,
bids may be submitted by facsimile. The only acceptable facsimile
number for responses to bid solicitations issued by PWGSC
headquarters is 819-997-9776 or, if applicable, the facsimile
number identified in the bid solicitation. The facsimile number for
responses to bid solicitations issued by PWGSC regional offices is
identified in the bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="2">For bids transmitted by facsimile, Canada will not be
responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or
receipt of the faxed bid including, but not limited to, the
following:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">receipt of garbled or incomplete bid;</li>
<li value="2">availability or condition of the receiving facsimile
equipment;</li>
<li value="3">incompatibility between the sending and receiving
equipment;</li>
<li value="4">delay in transmission or receipt of the bid;</li>
<li value="5">failure of the Bidder to properly identify the
bid;</li>
<li value="6">illegibility of the bid; or</li>
<li value="7">security of bid data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">A bid transmitted by facsimile constitutes the formal
bid of the Bidder and must be submitted in accordance with Section
05. The complete bid must be received by the bid closing date and
time.</li>
</ol>
<h2>09 Customs Clearance</h2>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Bidder to allow sufficient time
to obtain customs clearance, where required, before the bid closing
date and time. Delays related to the obtaining of customs clearance
cannot be construed as "undue delay in the mail" and will not be
accepted as a delayed bid under Section 07.</p>
<h2>10 Legal Capacity</h2>
<p>The Bidder must have the legal capacity to contract. If the
Bidder is a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate body,
the Bidder must provide, if requested by the Contracting Authority,
a statement and any requested supporting documentation indicating
the laws under which it is registered or incorporated together with
the registered or corporate name and place of business. This also
applies to bidders submitting a bid as a joint venture.</p>
<h2>11 Rights of Canada</h2>
<p>Canada reserves the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">reject any or all bids received in response to the
bid solicitation;</li>
<li value="2">enter into negotiations with bidders on any or all
aspects of their bids;</li>
<li value="3">accept any bid in whole or in part without
negotiations;</li>
<li value="4">cancel the bid solicitation at any time;</li>
<li value="5">reissue the bid solicitation;</li>
<li value="6">if no responsive bids are received and the
requirement is not substantially modified, reissue the bid
solicitation by inviting only the bidders who bid to resubmit bids
within a period designated by Canada; and,</li>
<li value="7">negotiate with the sole responsive Bidder to ensure
best value to Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>12 Rejection of Bid</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may reject a bid where any of the following
circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Bidder is subject to a Vendor Performance
Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which
renders the Bidder ineligible to bid on the requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the
bid, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under
the Vendor Performance Policy, which would render that employee or
subcontractor ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion
of the requirement the employee or subcontractor is to
perform;</li>
<li value="3">with respect to current or prior transactions with
the Government of Canada
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the Bidder is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason,
its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li value="2">evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery,
fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law
protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has
been received with respect to the Bidder, any of its employees or
any subcontractor included as part of the bid;</li>
<li value="3">Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of
suspension or termination for default with respect to a contract
with the Bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor included
as part of the bid;</li>
<li value="4">Canada determines that the Bidder's performance on other
contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as well as the
extent to which the Bidder performed the Work in accordance with
contractual clauses and conditions, is sufficiently poor to
jeopardize the successful completion of the requirement being bid
on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject a bid pursuant to a
provision of subsection 1. (c), the Contracting Authority will so
inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder ten (10) days within which
to make representations, before making a final decision on the bid
rejection.</li>
</ol>
<h2>13 Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive bid process,
enquiries and other communications regarding the bid solicitation
must be directed only to the Contracting Authority identified in
the bid solicitation. Failure to comply with this requirement may
result in the bid being declared non-responsive.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to
bidders, significant enquiries received and the replies to such
enquiries will be provided simultaneously to bidders to which the
bid solicitation has been sent, without revealing the sources of
the enquiries.</p>
<h2>14 Price Justification</h2>
<p>In the event that the Bidder's bid is the sole responsive bid
received, the Bidder must provide, on Canada's request, one or more
of the following price justification:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">a current published price list indicating the
percentage discount available to Canada; or</li>
<li value="2">a copy of paid invoices for the like quality and
quantity of the goods, services or both sold to other customers;
or</li>
<li value="3">a price breakdown showing the cost of direct labour,
direct materials, purchased items, engineering and plant overheads,
general and administrative overhead, transportation, etc., and
profit; or</li>
<li value="4">price or rate certifications; or</li>
<li value="5">any other supporting documentation as requested by
Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>15 Bid Costs</h2>
<p>No payment will be made for costs incurred in the preparation
and submission of a bid in response to the bid solicitation. Costs
associated with preparing and submitting a bid, as well as any
costs incurred by the Bidder associated with the evaluation of the
bid, are the sole responsibility of the Bidder.</p>
<h2>16 Conduct of Evaluation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In conducting its evaluation of the bids, Canada may,
but will have no obligation to, do the following:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">seek clarification or verification from bidders
regarding any or all information provided by them with respect to
the bid solicitation;</li>
<li value="2">contact any or all references supplied by bidders to
verify and validate any information submitted by them;</li>
<li value="3">request, before award of any contract, specific
information with respect to bidders' legal status;</li>
<li value="4">conduct a survey of bidders' facilities and/or
examine their technical, managerial, and financial capabilities to
determine if they are adequate to meet the requirements of the bid
solicitation;</li>
<li value="5">correct any error in the extended pricing of bids by
using unit pricing and any error in quantities in bids to reflect
the quantities stated in the bid solicitation; in the case of error
in the extension of prices, the unit price will govern.</li>
<li value="6">verify any information provided by bidders through
independent research, use of any government resources or by
contacting third parties;</li>
<li value="7">interview, at the sole costs of bidders, any bidder
and/or any or all of the resources proposed by bidders to fulfill
the requirement of the bid solicitation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Bidders will have the number of days specified in the
request by the Contracting Authority to comply with any request
related to any of the above items. Failure to comply with the
request may result in the bid being declared non-responsive.</li>
</ol>
<h2>17 Joint Venture</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A joint venture is an association of two or more
parties who combine their money, property, knowledge, expertise or
other resources in a single joint business enterprise, sometimes
referred as a consortium, to bid together on a requirement. Bidders
who bid as a joint venture must indicate clearly that it is a joint
venture and provide the following information:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the name of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li value="2">the Procurement Business Number of each member of the
joint venture;</li>
<li value="3">the name of the representative of the joint venture,
i.e. the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf,
if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the information is not clearly provided in the
bid, the Bidder must provide the information on request from the
Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The bid and any resulting contract must be signed by
all the members of the joint venture unless one member has been
appointed to act on behalf of all members of the joint venture. The
Contracting Authority may, at any time, require each member of the
joint venture to confirm that the representative has been appointed
with full authority to act as its representative for the purposes
of the bid solicitation and any resulting contract. If a contract
is awarded to a joint venture, all members of the joint venture
will be jointly and severally or solidarily liable for the
performance of any resulting contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>18 Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, bidders are advised that Canada may reject a bid in the
following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of
interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available
to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or
appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing
or has provided the goods and services described in the bid
solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the
criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and
provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that
it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to
have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within
Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of
interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest
or unfair advantage exists.</li>
</ol>
<h2>19 Entire Requirement</h2>
<p>The bid solicitation documents contain all the requirements
relating to the bid solicitation. Any other information or
documentation provided to or obtained by a bidder from any source
are not relevant. Bidders should not assume that practices used
under previous contracts will continue, unless they are described
in the bid solicitation. Bidders should also not assume that their
existing capabilities meet the requirements of the bid solicitation
simply because they have met previous requirements.</p>
<h2>20 Further Information</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">For further information, bidders may contact the
Contracting Authority identified in the bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="2">For bid solicitations issued out of PWGSC
headquarters, enquiries concerning receipt of bids may be addressed
to the Bid Receiving Unit, Procurement Operational Support
Division, telephone 819-956-3370. For bid solicitations issued out
of PWGSC regional offices, enquiries concerning receipt of bids may
be addressed to the Contracting Authority identified in the bid
solicitation.</li>
