                            Number as shown on page 1 of the Contract.

       (b)    all the certificates appearing on the said form are signed by

       (d)    the deliverables are accepted by the Technical Authority;

       (e)    the claim is certified by the Contracting Authority and the 
              Technical Authority; and

       (f)    two (2) sets of backup documentation (receipts, vouchers, etc.) 
              to support the claim are supplied to the Contracting 
              Authority.

2.     The Contractor shall prepare and certify an original and two (2) 
       copies of its claim on form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111.  The claim will be 
       forwarded to the Contracting Authority who will certify the claim 
       and forward it to the Technical Authority for certification and 
       payment.

3.     The balance owing shall be paid to the Contractor, subject to:

       (a)    completion and acceptance of the Work; 

       (b)    the submission of all deliverables to the Technical Authority; 
              and 

       (c)    the certification of the final claim by the Contracting 
              Authority and the Technical Authority.

4.     Progress payments shall be regarded as interim payments only and 
       Canada shall have the right to conduct interim cost/time 
       verifications or audits and to make adjustments from time to time 
       during the performance of the Work.  Any overpayments resulting from 
       such progress payments or otherwise shall be refunded promptly to 
       Canada.

5.     Payment by Canada to the Contractor for the Work shall be made:

       (a)    in the case of a progress payment other than the final 
              payment, within thirty (30) days following the date of 
              receipt of the duly completed form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111;

       (b)    in the case of a final payment, within thirty (30) days 
              following the date of receipt of the duly completed form 
              PWGSC-TPSGC 1111, or within thirty (30) days following the 
              date on which the Work is completed, whichever date is the 
              later.

6.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the progress claim, 
       within fifteen (15) days of its receipt, Canada shall notify the 
       Contractor of the nature of the objection.  "Form of the claim" 
       means a claim that contains or is accompanied by such substantiating 
       documentation as Canada requires.  Failure by Canada to act within 
       fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified in 
       subsection 5 of the clause to apply for the sole purpose of 
       calculating interest on overdue accounts.
