<h2>Task Authorization:</h2>
<p>The Work or a portion of the Work to be performed under the Contract will be on an "as and when requested basis" using a Task Authorization (TA). The Work described in the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> must be in accordance with the scope of the Contract.</p>
<p class="description"><strong>Instructions to contracting officers:</strong> Insert the following paragraph when more than
one contract will be awarded.</p>
<blockquote>As more than one contract has been awarded for this requirement, a request to perform a task will be sent to the first ranked contractor. If that contractor confirms in writing that it is unable to perform the task as a result of previous commitments under a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>, the request to perform a task will then be forwarded to the contractor ranked second. This process will continue until the task can be performed by another contractor. If no contractor can perform the task, Canada reserves the right to acquire the required Work by other means. A contractor may advise the <span class="input-required"><var>__________</var> <kbd>(<em>insert "Project" or
"Technical" Authority</em>)</kbd></span> and the Contracting Authority in writing that it is unable to carry out additional tasks as a result of previous commitments under a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> and no request to perform a task will be sent to that contractor until that contractor has given notice in writing to the <span class="input-required"><var>__________</var> <kbd>(<em>insert "Project" or "Technical" Authority</em>)</kbd></span> and the Contracting Authority that it is available to perform additional tasks.</blockquote>
