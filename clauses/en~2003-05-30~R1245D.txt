       departmental decision and the Departmental Representative shall give 
       notice of the departmental decision within fourteen (14) days of 
       receiving the request, setting out the particulars of the response 
       and any relevant clauses of the Agreement.

       by notice may refer the disagreement to Mediation.

       conducted with the assistance of a skilled and experienced mediator 
       chosen by the Consultant from a list of mediators proposed by the 
       Minister, and departmental Mediation procedures shall be used unless 
       the parties agree otherwise.

       conducted during Mediation, shall be without prejudice.
