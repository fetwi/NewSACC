<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Contractor shall be responsible for implementing a quality system 
appropriate to the scope of the work to be performed. It is recommended 
that the quality system be based on the applicable model of the ISO 9000 
series.

The Contractor shall be responsible for performing or having performed all 
inspections and tests necessary to substantiate that the materiel or 
services provided conform to the drawings, specifications and contract 
requirements. The Contractor shall keep accurate and complete inspection 
records which shall, upon request, be made available to the authorized 
Department of National Defence (DND) representative, who may make copies 
thereof and take extracts therefrom during the performance of the Contract 
and for a period of one (1) year thereafter.

The Contracting Authority and DND shall have access to the Work at any time 
during working hours where any part of the Work is being carried out and 
may make examinations and such tests of the Work as they may think fit 
under the circumstances. Should the Work or any part thereof not be in 
accordance with the requirements of the Contract, the authorized DND 
representative shall have the right to reject the Work and require its 
correction or replacement at the Contractor's expense. DND shall inform the 
Contractor of the motives for any such rejection.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all materiel is subject to verification and 
acceptance by DND at destination prior to payment. The authorized DND 
representative at destination may either be the consignee(s), the Technical 
Authority, or the Quality Assurance Authority.
