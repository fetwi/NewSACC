<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Subject to the following provisions, a portion of the price may be 
       increased or decreased, depending on the price variation of paper 
       stock. This clause is only applicable to changes to the price of 
       paper stock (upwards or downwards) that occur after thirty (30) days 
       from the closing date of the solicitation.

2.     In the event of paper transaction cost variation, the Contractor 
       shall provide notice of increase or decrease in the price of paper 
       used for this requirement. It is mandatory that for the notice to be 
       considered it must be received within ten (10) days of the paper 
       delivered to the printer, indicating the price fluctuation (upwards 
       or downwards) of paper stock, as publicly announced and came into 
       effect, by at least three (3) Canadian paper mills who manufacture 
       the grade specified in this requirement and one of those announcing 
       the increase or decrease is in fact the supplier to the contractor 
       either directly or through a distributor.

3.     If less than three (3) Canadian paper mills manufacture the 
       specified grade, the majority of the mills making this grade must 
       have announced a price change (upwards or downwards) that did come 
       into effect for escalation to be implemented.

4.     At the time of submitting its bid, the Contractor represents that 
       the transaction costs of paper and estimated quantities of the paper 
       proposed, to be used for this requirement are as follows:

       (a)    cover stock: (if applicable) _____ lb. at a base transaction 
              price per Cwt. of $ _____. Brandname and manufacturing mill: _____

       (b)    text stock: (if applicable) _____ lb. at a base transaction 
              price per Cwt. of $ _____. Brandname and manufacturing mill: _____ 

       (c)    text stock: (if applicable) _____ lb. at a base transaction 
              price per Cwt. of $ _____. Brandname and manufacturing mill: _____ 

5.     If requested by the Contracting Authority, the above base 
       transaction prices will be supported by submitting copies of 
       quotations from the paper supplier(s).

6.     Escalation will be implemented by using the percentage of the 
       announced increase or decrease that came into effect by applying it 
       to the transaction base price(s). Price changes will also be 
       supported by before and after invoices.

7.     Upon receipt of the above notice and of the evidence of the price 
       changes announced by the paper mills, the Contracting Authority will 
       then modify the price, by an amendment thereto, to reflect the 
       percentage fluctuation of the paper costs to the Contractor's 
       supported based transaction prices.

8.     While not activating the above escalation clause, if, after award, 
       an equivalent paper stock is used by the Contractor other than that 
       specified in the solicitation document, the Contractor must advise 
       the Contracting Authority in writing within fourteen (14) calendar 
       days of this change. It is understood that equivalent means that the 
       paper must meet the specifications in the solicitation document.
