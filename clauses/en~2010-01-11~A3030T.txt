<pre>1.     The Federal Contractors Program (FCP) requires that some suppliers, 
       including a supplier who is a member of a joint venture, bidding for 
       federal government contracts, valued at $200,000 or more (including 
       all applicable taxes), make a formal commitment to implement 
       employment equity.  This is a condition precedent to contract award.  
       If the Bidder, or, if the Bidder is a joint venture and if any 
       member of the joint venture, is subject to the FCP, evidence of its 
       commitment must be provided before the award of the Contract.

       Suppliers who have been declared ineligible contractors by Human 
       Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer 
       eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold for 
       solicitation of bids as set out in the <em>Government Contracts 
       Regulations</em>.  Suppliers may be declared ineligible contractors 
       either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRSDC, or 
       following their voluntary withdrawal from the FCP for a reason other 
       than the reduction of their workforce to less than 100 employees.  
       Any bids from ineligible contractors, including a bid from a joint 
       venture that has a member who is an ineligible contractor, will be 
       declared non-responsive.

2.     If the Bidder does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 3.(a) 
       or (b) below, or does not have a valid certificate number confirming 
       its adherence to the FCP, the Bidder must fax (819-953-8768) a copy 
       of the signed form <a href="http://www1.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/search/eforms/index.cgi?app=profile&amp;form=lab1168&amp;dept=sc&amp;lang=e" rel="external">LAB 1168</a>, Certificate of Commitment to Implement 
       Employment Equity, to the Labour Branch of HRSDC.

3.     The Bidder, or, if the Bidder is a joint venture the member of the 
       joint venture, certifies its status with the FCP, as follows:

       The Bidder or the member of the joint venture

       (a)    (    ) is not subject to the FCP, having a workforce of less 
                     than 100 full-time or part-time permanent employees,

                     worked 12 weeks or more in Canada, but has not 
                     previously obtained a certificate number from HRSDC 
                     (having not bid on requirements of $200,000 or more), 
                     in which case a duly signed certificate of commitment 
                     is attached;

       (d)    (    ) is subject to the FCP, and has a valid certificate 
                     number as follows: _______ (e.g. has not been declared
