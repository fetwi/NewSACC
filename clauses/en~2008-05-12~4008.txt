<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use these supplemental general conditions only when the contractor must collect 
and/or use personal information about individuals to perform the work (e.g., 
processing individuals' health information).  Before including these 
supplemental general conditions in the contract, contracting officers must 
consult with Legal Services to ensure they are necessary.

These conditions do not specifically address the numerous policies that apply to 
Canada's use and handling of personal information, such as the Treasury Board 
(TB) Privacy Impact Assessment Policy and Guidelines, the various TB policies 
concerning privacy and data protection, and the TB Policy on Management of 
Information Technology.  Any additional requirements necessitated by these 
policies will need to be reflected elsewhere in the contract.

Contracting officers must consult Legal Services if there are concerns about the 
personal information being stored in Canada, to determine whether it would also 
be appropriate to use clause A9122C.

When more than one supplemental general conditions are used, contracting 
officers must list the  supplemental general conditions in the priority of 
documents clause in ascending order based on the identification number.</pre>

<strong>4008   01     (2008-05-12)  Interpretation</strong><strong></strong>

1.     In the Contract, unless the context otherwise requires,

       "General Conditions" means the general conditions that form part of 
       the Contract;

       "Personal Information" means information about an individual, 
       including the types of information specifically described in the <em>
       Privacy Act,</em> R.S. 1985, c. P-21;

       "Record" means any hard copy document or any data in a 
       machine-readable format containing Personal Information;

2.     Words and expressions defined in the General Conditions and used in 
       these supplemental general conditions have the meanings given to 
       them in the General Conditions.

3.     If there is any inconsistency between the General Conditions and 
       these supplemental general conditions, the applicable provisions of 
       these supplemental general conditions prevail.

<strong>4008   02     (2008-05-12)  Ownership of Personal Information and Records</strong><strong></strong>

To perform the Work, the Contractor will be provided with and/or will be 
collecting Personal Information from third parties.  The Contractor 
acknowledges that it has no rights in the Personal Information or the 
Records and that Canada owns the Records.  On request, the Contractor must 
make all the Personal Information and Records available to Canada 
immediately in a format acceptable to Canada.

<strong>4008   03     (2008-05-12)  Use of Personal Information</strong><strong></strong>

The Contractor agrees to create, collect, receive, manage, access, use, 
retain, and dispose of the Personal Information and the Records only to 
perform the Work in accordance with the Contract.

<strong>4008   04     (2008-05-12)  Collection of Personal Information</strong><strong></strong>

1.     If the Contractor must collect Personal Information from a third 
       party to perform the Work, the Contractor must only collect Personal 
       Information that is required to perform the Work.  The Contractor 
       must collect the Personal Information from the individual to whom it 
       relates and the Contractor must inform that individual (at or before 
       the time when it collects the Personal Information) of the following:

       (a)    that the Personal Information is being collected on behalf of, 
              and will be provided to, Canada;

       (b)    the ways the Personal Information will be used;

       (c)    that the disclosure of the Personal Information is voluntary 
              or, if there is a legal requirement to disclose the Personal 
              Information, the basis of that legal requirement;

       (d)    the consequences, if any, of refusing to provide the 
              information;

       (e)    that the individual has a right to access and correct his or 
              her own Personal Information; and

       (f)    that the Personal Information will form part of a specific 
              personal information bank (within the meaning of the <em>Privacy 
              Act</em>), and also provide the individual with information about 
              which government institution controls that personal 
              information bank, if the Contracting Authority has provided 
              this information to the Contractor.

2.     The Contractor, its subcontractors, and their respective employees 
       must identify themselves to the individuals from whom they are 
       collecting Personal Information and must provide those individuals 
       with a way to verify that they are authorized to collect the 
       Personal Information under a Contract with Canada.

3.     If requested by the Contracting Authority, the Contractor must 
       develop a request for consent form to be used when collecting 
       Personal Information, or a script for collecting the Personal 
       Information by telephone.  The Contractor must not begin using a 
       form or script unless the Contracting Authority first approves it in 
       writing.  The Contractor must also obtain the Contracting Authority'
       s approval before making any changes to a form or script.

4.     At the time it requests Personal Information from any individual, if 
       the Contractor doubts that the individual has the capacity to 
       provide consent to the disclosure and use of his or her Personal 
       Information, the Contractor must ask the Contracting Authority for 
       instructions.

<strong>4008   05     (2008-05-12)  Maintaining the Accuracy, Privacy and Integrity 
                            of Personal Information</strong><strong></strong>

The Contractor must ensure that the Personal Information is as accurate, 
complete, and up to date as possible.  The Contractor must protect the 
privacy of the Personal Information.  To do so, at a minimum, the 
Contractor must:

(a)    not use any personal identifiers (e.g., social insurance number) to 
       link multiple databases containing Personal Information;

(b)    segregate all Records from the Contractor's own information and 
       records;

(c)    restrict access to the Personal Information and the Records to 
       people who require access to perform the Work (for example, by using 
       passwords or biometric access controls);

(d)    provide training to anyone to whom the Contractor will provide 
       access to the Personal Information regarding the obligation to keep 
       it confidential and use it only to perform the Work.  The Contractor 
       must provide this training before giving an individual access to any 
       Personal Information and the Contractor must keep a record of the 
       training and make it available to the Contracting Authority if 
       requested;

(e)    if requested by the Contracting Authority, before providing anyone 
       with access to the Personal Information, require anyone to whom the 
       Contractor provides access to the Personal Information to 
       acknowledge in writing (in a form approved by the Contracting 
       Authority) their responsibilities to maintain the privacy of the 
       Personal Information;

(f)    keep a record of all requests made by an individual to review his or 
       her Personal Information, and any requests to correct errors or 
       omissions in the Personal Information (whether those requests are 
       made directly by an individual or by Canada on behalf of an 
       individual);

(g)    include a notation on any Record(s) that an individual has requested 
       be corrected if the Contractor has decided not to make the 
       correction for any reason.  Whenever this occurs, the Contractor 
       must immediately advise the Contracting Authority of the details of 
       the requested correction and the reasons for the Contractor's 
       decision not to make it.  If directed by the Contracting Authority 
       to make the correction, the Contractor must do so; 

(h)    keep a record of the date and source of the last update to each 
       Record;

(i)    maintain an audit log that electronically records all instances of 
       and attempts to access Records stored electronically.  The audit log 
       must be in a format that can be reviewed by the Contractor and 
       Canada at any time; and

(j)    secure and control access to any hard copy Records.

<strong>4008   06     (2008-05-12)  Safeguarding Personal Information</strong><strong></strong>

The Contractor must safeguard the Personal Information at all times by 
taking all measures reasonably necessary to secure it and protect its 
integrity and confidentiality.  To do so, at a minimum, the Contractor must:

(a)    store the Personal Information electronically so that a password (or 
       a similar access control mechanism, such as biometric access) is 
       required to access the system or database in which the Personal 
       Information is stored;

(b)    ensure that passwords or other access controls are provided only to 
       individuals who require access to the Personal Information to 
       perform the Work;

(c)    not outsource the electronic storage of Personal Information to a 
       third party (including an affiliate) unless the Contracting 
       Authority has first consented in writing;

(d)    safeguard any database or computer system on which the Personal 
       Information is stored from external access using methods that are 
       generally used, from time to time, by prudent public and private 
       sector organizations in Canada in order to protect highly secure or 
       sensitive information;

(e)    maintain a secure back-up copy of all Records, updated at least 
       weekly;

(f)    implement any reasonable security or protection measures requested 
       by Canada from time to time; and

(g)    notify the Contracting Authority immediately of any security 
       breaches; for example, any time an unauthorized individual accesses 
       any Personal Information.

<strong>4008   07     (2008-05-12)  Appointment of Privacy Officer</strong><strong></strong>

The Contractor must appoint someone to be its privacy officer and to act as 
its representative for all matters related to the Personal Information and 
the Records.  The Contractor must provide that person's name to the 
Contracting Authority within ten (10) days of the award of the Contract.

<strong>4008   08     (2008-05-12)  Quarterly Reporting Obligations</strong><strong></strong>

Within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each quarter (January-March; 
April-June; July-September; October-December), the Contractor must submit 
the following to the Contracting Authority:

(a)    a description of any new measures taken by the Contractor to protect 
       the Personal Information (for example, new software or access 
       controls being used by the Contractor);

(b)    a list of any corrections made to Personal Information at the 
       request of an individual (including the name of the individual, the 
       date of the request, and the correction made); 

(c)    details of any complaints received from individuals about the way in 
       which their Personal Information is being collected or handled by 
       the Contractor; and

(d)    a complete copy (in an electronic format agreed to by the 
       Contracting Authority and the Contractor) of all the Personal 
       Information stored electronically by the Contractor.

<strong>4008   09     (2008-05-12)  Threat and Risk Assessment</strong><strong></strong>

Within ninety (90) calendar days of the award of the Contract and, if the 
Contract lasts longer than one year, within thirty (30) calendar days of 
each anniversary date of the Contract, the Contractor must submit to the 
Contracting Authority a threat and risk assessment, which must include:

(a)    a copy of the current version of any request for consent form or 
       script being used by the Contractor to collect Personal Information;

(b)    a list of the types of Personal Information used by the Contractor 
       in connection with the Work;

(c)    a list of all locations where hard copies of Personal Information 
       are stored;

(d)    a list of all locations where Personal Information in 
       machine-readable format is stored (for example, the location where 
       any server housing a database including any Personal Information is 
       located), including back-ups;

(e)    a list of every person to whom the Contractor has granted access to 
       the Personal Information or the Records;

(f)    a list of all measures being taken by the Contractor to protect the 
       Personal Information and the Records;

(g)    a detailed explanation of any potential or actual threats to the 
       Personal Information or any Record, together with an assessment of 
       the risks created by these threats and the adequacy of existing 
       safeguards to prevent these risks; and

(h)    an explanation of any new measures the Contractor intends to 
       implement to safeguard the Personal Information and the Records.

<strong>4008   10     (2008-05-12)  Audit</strong><strong></strong>

Canada may audit the Contractor's compliance with these supplemental 
general conditions at any time.  If requested by the Contracting Authority, 
the Contractor must provide Canada (or Canada's authorized representative) 
with access to its premises and to the Personal Information and Records at 
all reasonable times.  If Canada identifies any deficiencies during an 
audit, the Contractor must immediately correct the deficiencies at its own 
expense.

<strong>4008   11     (2008-05-12)  Statutory Obligations</strong><strong></strong>

1.     The Contractor acknowledges that Canada is required to handle the 
       Personal Information and the Records in accordance with the 
       provisions of Canada's <em>Privacy Act</em>, <em>Access to Information Act</em>, R.S. 
       1985, c. A-1, and <em>Library and Archives of Canada Act</em>,<em> </em>S.C. 2004, c. 
       11.  The Contractor agrees to comply with any requirement 
       established by the Contracting Authority that is reasonably required 
       to ensure that Canada meets its obligations under these acts and any 
       other legislation in effect from time to time.

2.     The Contractor acknowledges that its obligations under the Contract 
       are in addition to any obligations it has under the <em>Personal 
       Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em>, S.C. 2000, c. 5, 
       or similar legislation in effect from time to time in any province 
       or territory of Canada.  If the Contractor believes that any 
       obligations in the Contract prevent it from meeting its obligations 
       under any of these laws, the Contractor must immediately notify the 
       Contracting Authority of the specific provision of the Contract and 
       the specific obligation under the law with which the Contractor 
       believes it conflicts.

<strong>4008   12     (2008-05-12)  Disposing of Records and Returning Records to 
Canada</strong><strong></strong>

The Contractor must not dispose of any Record, except as instructed by the 
Contracting Authority.  On request by the Contracting Authority, or once 
the Work involving the Personal Information is complete, the Contract is 
complete, or the Contract is terminated, whichever of these comes first, 
the Contractor must return all Records (including all copies) to the 
Contracting Authority.

<strong>4008   13     (2008-05-12)  Legal Requirement to Disclose Personal 
Information</strong><strong></strong>

Before disclosing any of the Personal Information pursuant to any 
applicable legislation, regulation, or an order of any court, tribunal or 
administrative body with jurisdiction, the Contractor must immediately 
notify the Contracting Authority, in order to provide the Contracting 
Authority with an opportunity to participate in any relevant proceedings.

<strong>4008   14     (2008-05-12)  Complaints</strong><strong></strong>

Canada and the Contractor each agree to notify the other immediately if a 
complaint is received under the <em>Access to Information Act</em> or the <em>Privacy 
Act</em> or other relevant legislation regarding the Personal Information.  Each 
Party agrees to provide any necessary information to the other to assist in 
responding to the complaint and to inform the other immediately of the 
outcome of that complaint.<strong></strong>

<strong>4008   15     (2008-05-12)  Exception</strong><strong></strong>

The obligations set out in these supplemental general conditions do not 
apply to any Personal Information that is already in the public domain, as 
long as it did not become part of the public domain as a result of any act 
or omission of the Contractor or any of its subcontractors, agents, or 
representatives, or any of their employees.
