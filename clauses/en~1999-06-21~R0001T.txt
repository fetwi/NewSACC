              prices or a combination of lump sum and unit prices, whether

              structure, skilled personnel, experience and equipment to 
              perform competently the work under the contract, and

       .3     the Tenderer's performance on other contracts.

       to 13.2, Her Majesty may consider, but not be limited to, such 
       matters as:

       .1     the quality of workmanship of the Tenderer in performing the 
              work,

       .2     the timeliness of completion of the work, and 

       .3     the Tenderer's overall management of the work and its effect 
              on the level of effort demanded of the department and its 
              representatives.
