       (a)    "<strong>Background Intellectual Property</strong>" means all Technical 
              Information that is not Foreground Intellectual Property and 
              that is proprietary to the Contractor, its subcontractors or 
              any other supplier of the Contractor;

       (b)    "<strong>Foreground Intellectual Property</strong>" means any Invention first 
              conceived, developed or reduced to practice as part of the 
              Work under the Contract and all Technical Information 
              collected, developed or produced as part of the Work under 
              the Contract;

       (c)    "<strong>Invention</strong>" means any new and useful art, process, 
              methodology, technique, machine, manufacture or composition 
              of matter, or any new and useful improvement of any art, 
              process, methodology, technique, machine, manufacture or 
              composition of matter, whether or not patentable;

       (e)    "<strong>Technical Information</strong>" means all information of a scientific 
              or technical nature relating to the Work, whether oral or

              test data, and computer software, source code, data files, 
              and documentation.

(2)    The Contractor shall promptly report and fully disclose to the 
       Minister the conception, development, or reduction to practice of 
       any Invention that could be Foreground Intellectual Property, and 
       shall report and fully disclose to the Minister all other Foreground 
       Intellectual Property at a time selected by the Contractor, but not 
       later than the time of completion of the Work or such other time as 
       the Minister or the Contract may require in respect of any such 
       Foreground Intellectual Property.  The Contractor shall, in each 
       disclosure under this subsection, indicate the name of any 
       subcontractor at any tier in which title to any of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property has vested or will vest.

(3)    Except as otherwise specified in the Contract and subject to 
       subsection (7), copyright, patent and all other proprietary rights 
       to all Foreground Intellectual Property shall, immediately upon its  
       conception, development, reduction to practice or production, vest 
       in and remain the property of the Contractor.  

(4)    Notwithstanding the Contractor's ownership of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property in any prototype or any custom machinery, 
       device, system or equipment delivered under the Contract, Canada 
       shall have unrestricted ownership rights in the thing delivered, 
       including the right to sell it and to make it available for public 
       use whether for a fee or otherwise.

(5)    The Contractor hereby grants to Canada a non-exclusive, irrevocable, 
       world-wide, fully paid and royalty-free licence to use any 
       Foreground Intellectual Property and such of the Background 
       Intellectual Property incorporated into the Work or necessary for 
       the performance of the Work as may be required solely for the 
       following purposes:

       (a)    for the operation, maintenance, repair or overhaul of the 
              Work;

       (b)    for the purpose of manufacturing spare parts for maintenance, 
              repair or overhaul of the Work by Canada if those parts are 
              not reasonably available to enable timely maintenance, repair 
              or overhaul; or

       (c)    in respect of Foreground Intellectual Property only, for the 
              further development of or alteration of any part of the Work;

       including the right to sublicense the use of the Foreground or 
       Background Intellectual Property to an Other Contractor to be used 
       solely in the carrying out of a contract let by Canada for a purpose 
       set out in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) in relation to that particular 
       intellectual property.   Any sublicence given by Canada to an Other 
       Contractor shall require the Other Contractor to maintain the 
       confidentiality of the Foreground or Background Intellectual 
       Property.  In respect of Background Intellectual Property, Canada 
       shall have the right to sublicense use by an Other Contractor only 
       if the Contractor is unable or unwilling to do the maintenance, 
       repair or overhaul or provide the spare parts on reasonable 
       commercial terms and within reasonable delivery times.

(6)    Wherever practical, the Contractor shall mark or identify any 
       Foreground or Background Intellectual Property delivered to Canada 
       under this section as "Property of (Contractor name); permitted 
       Government uses defined under DSS Contract No. (fill in contract 
       number)", and Canada shall not be liable for any unauthorized use or 
       disclosure of Foreground or Background Intellectual Property that 
       could have been so marked or identified and was not.
 
(7)    Until the Contractor discloses Foreground Intellectual Property in 
       accordance with subsection (2), it shall not, without the prior 
       written permission of the Minister, assign or otherwise transfer 
       title to the Foreground Intellectual Property or license or 
       otherwise authorize the use of that intellectual property by any 
       person.  If the Contractor fails to disclose any Foreground 
       Intellectual Property in accordance with subsection (2), the 
       Minister may, within 90 days of the date when Canada learns of the 
       failure of the Contractor to so disclose, issue a notice to the 
       Contractor whereupon copyright, patent and all other proprietary 
       rights to the Foreground Intellectual Property not disclosed shall 
       immediately vest in and remain the property of Canada.  In that 
       event, the Contractor shall, at its own expense, execute such 
       conveyances or other documents relating to title as the minister for 
       whose department or agency the Work is being carried out may require, 
       and the Contractor shall, at Canada's expense, afford that minister 
       all reasonable assistance in the prosecution of any patent 
       application or registration of copyright or an industrial design, 
       including assistance of the inventor in the case of Inventions.

(8)    Canada is prepared to license the use by the Contractor of 
       intellectual property owned by Canada and furnished to the 
       Contractor under this Contract for purposes of the commercial 
       exploitation or further development by the Contractor of the 
       Foreground Intellectual Property, on terms and conditions, which may 
       include the payment of compensation, to be negotiated between the 
       Contractor and the minister for whose department or agency the Work 
       is being carried out.

(9)    The Contractor shall not, without the written permission of the 
       Minister, incorporate into the Work any Background Intellectual 
       Property unless it owns or has procured the rights necessary to 
       provide the licence to Canada under subsection (5).  

(10)   In any transfer of title to or assignment of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property or any licence for the use of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property, the Contractor shall impose on the other 
       party any obligations to Canada imposed under this Contract and any 
       restrictions on the use or disposition of the Foreground 
       Intellectual Property contained in this Contract, including the 
       obligation to impose the same obligations and restrictions on any 
       subsequent transferee, assignee or licensee, so that such 
       obligations and restrictions will continue to apply to the current 
       holder of those rights to the Foreground Intellectual Property.  The 
       Contractor agrees that neither the Contractor nor any such current 
       holder of those rights to the Foreground Intellectual Property shall 
       have the right to collect a royalty or other compensation on the use 
       of the Foreground Intellectual Property for purposes of a contract 
       or other arrangement with Canada.  The Contractor or other current 
       holder of rights to the Foreground Intellectual Property shall 
       promptly notify Canada of the name, address and other pertinent 
       information in regard to any such transferee, assignee or licensee.

(11)   Before and after final payment to the Contractor, the Minister shall 
       have the right to examine all records and supporting data of the 
       Contractor which the Minister reasonably deems pertinent to the 
       discovery or identification of Technical Information to which 
       subsection (2) applies.

(12)   The Contractor shall, upon the written request of the Minister, 
       furnish all logistical support and life-cycle support data relating 
       to the Work, including lists of suppliers, supplier part numbers and 
       related drawings, and shall do so at the minimum extra cost to 
       Canada.
