Canada.  The Contractor is responsible for maintaining satisfactory records 
of the disposition of all GSM.

contracted.  Only the quantity of material stated herein will be supplied 
by Canada without charge.

If additional GSM is required for Contract completion, it shall be 
purchased from Canada at the unit price stated herein, GST extra.  Payment 
for excess material shall be in the form of a certified cheque payable to 
the Receiver General for Canada and shall be sent with the request for 
additional material directly to the attention of the Contracting Authority 
at the address specified on page 1.  This material will be shipped to the 
Contractor, transportation charges collect.

Where pre-production sample(s) is a requirement of the Contract, the 
Contractor agrees that no GSM, with the exception of material required for 
the pre-production sample(s), shall be cut, used or processed until the 
Government Technical Authority has approved the pre-production sample and 
provided a formal notice of acceptance.  Damage incurred as a result of 
cutting GSM prior to acceptance of any pre-production sample(s) shall be 
the Contractor's responsibility.

The Contractor shall replace or make good, at its own expense, any goods 
which fail to conform to the Contract requirements, as a result of faulty 
or inefficient cutting, manufacture or workmanship.

In the event of problems with the GSM supplied, the Contractor shall advise 
the Contracting Authority immediately, identifying the specific problem.  
Should the Contractor proceed without guidance from the Contracting 
Authority, any costs incurred, and loss of GSM shall be at the Contractor's 
expense.

The Contractor shall be required to rebate Canada for the value of GSM 
applicable to any quantity not delivered against the Contract.  The value 
shall be calculated at the unit price and usage stated herein.

Upon completion of the total Contract quantity, should there be GSM with a 
total value in excess of $250, the Contractor is required to either:

a)     return the material to the sender with transportation charges to the 
       account of Canada.  The Contracting Authority is to be contacted to 
       make appropriate arrangements;<strong><strong><strong> OR
</strong></strong></strong>
b)     apply for an overrun to the Contract quantity.  Prior approval by 
       the Contracting Authority for an overrun is required under a formal 
       Contract amendment.
 
Canada will not be obligated to pay for work performed on any GSM that is 
damaged or lost while in the Contractor's care.

GSM and/or rejected units containing GSM shall not be disposed of without 
written approval of the Contracting Authority.  Transportation charges for 
the return of GSM where the Contract has not been satisfactorily completed 
shall be at the Contractor's expense.

While a final GSM accounting is not automatically required for every 
Contract, Canada reserves the right to request a final accounting at any 
time within one year of the Contract completion date.
