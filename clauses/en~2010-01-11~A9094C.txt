<pre>1.     In order for the Contractor to meet its obligations under the 
       Contract, the Parties acknowledge that the Contractor has started 
       the Work required pursuant to the Contract before the effective date 
       of the Contract (Pre-contractual Work) and has incurred costs in the 
       performance of such work.  Costs incurred by the Contractor in the 
       performance of the Pre-contractual Work, that would have been 
       treated as costs reasonably and properly incurred if they had been 
       incurred after the effective date of the Contract, will be paid to 
       the Contractor in accordance with the Basis of Payment of the 
       Contract subject to acceptance of the Pre-contractual Work by Canada.   
       The Contractor agrees that upon such payment by Canada to the  
       Contractor, Canada will be released and forever discharged from all 
       manner of actions, claims, suits or demands in relation to the 
       Pre-contractual Work.

2.     The Parties confirm that copyright in the Pre-contractual Work 
       belongs to Canada and that ownership of all intellectual property 
       rights in all information of a scientific, technical or artistic 
       nature relating to the Work, in any form or medium, conceived, 
       developed or produced by the Contractor in the performance of the 
       Pre-contractual Work belongs to Canada.
