General Conditions, DSS-MAS 1026A, the Contractor hereby warrants: 

       a) the painting of the underwater portion of the hull for a period 
       of twelve (12) months commencing from the date of undocking, and

       commencing from the date of acceptance of vessel; said warranty 
       being that all workmanship and materials will be of first class 
       quality and fully in accordance with the specifications. The 
       Contractor also hereby warrants that any part or parts which the 
       shipbuilder has provided and which may, within said ninety (90) days 
       or twelve (12) month period, be found defective or display signs of 
       weakness or undue wear due to faulty design, materials or 
       workmanship shall be repaired or replaced, provided that in the 
       event any defects develop on the underwater painting work during the 
       warranty period, the Contractor will only be liable to repair and/or 
       replace to a value to be determined as follows: 

       Original cost to the Crown of the underwater painting work, divided 
       by fifty-two (52) weeks and multiplied by the number of weeks 
       remaining in the warranty period. The resultant would represent the 
       "Dollar Credit" due to the Crown from the Contractor.
