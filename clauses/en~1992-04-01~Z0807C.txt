<ol type="a">
<li value="7">Limited risk of loss.
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The term "Contractor's managerial personnel," as used
in this clause, means any of the Contractor's directors, officers,
managers, superintendents, or equivalent representatives who have
supervision or direction of:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">all or substantially all of the Contractor's
business;</li>
<li value="2">all or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at
any one plant or separate location at which the Contract is being
performed; or</li>
<li value="3">a separate and complete major industrial operation
connected with performing this Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor shall not be liable for loss or
destruction of, or damage to, the Government property provided
under this Contract or for expenses incidental to such loss,
destruction, or damage, except as provided in subparagraphs 3. and
4. below.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor shall be responsible for loss or
destruction of, or damage to, the Government property provided
under this Contract (including expenses incidental to such loss,
destruction, or damage):
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">that results from a risk expressly required to be
insured under this Contract, but only to the extent of the
insurance required to be purchased and maintained or to the extent
of insurance actually purchased and maintained, whichever is
greater;</li>
<li value="2">that results from a risk that is in fact covered by
insurance or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but
only to the extent of such insurance or reimbursement;</li>
<li value="3">for which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under
the express terms of this Contract;</li>
<li value="4">that results from wilful misconduct or lack of good faith
on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or</li>
<li value="5">that results from a failure on the part of the
Contractor, due to wilful misconduct or lack of good faith on the
part of the Contractor's managerial personnel, to establish and
administer a program or system for the control, use, protection,
preservation, maintenance, and repair of Government property as
required by paragraph (e) of clause Z0806C.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">If the Contractor fails to act as provided by
subdivision (g)3.(v) above, after being notified (by certified mail
addressed to one of the Contractor's managerial personnel) of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>'s
or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government's disapproval, withdrawal of approval, or
nonacceptance of the system or program, it shall be conclusively
presumed that such failure was due to wilful misconduct or lack of
good faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial
personnel.</li>
<li value="2">In such event, any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
the Government property shall be presumed to have resulted from
such failure, unless the Contractor can establish by clear and
convincing evidence that such loss, destruction, or damage:
<ol type="A">
<li value="1">did not result from the Contractor's failure to maintain an
approved program or system; or</li>
<li value="2">occurred while an approved program or system was maintained
by the Contractor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">If the Contractor transfers Government property to
the possession and control of a subcontractor, the transfer shall
not affect the liability of the Contractor for loss or destruction
of, or damage to, the property as set forth above. However, the
Contractor shall require the subcontractor to assume the risk of,
and be responsible for, any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
the property while in the subcontractor's possession or control,
except to the extent that the subcontract, with the advance
approval of the Contracting Officer, relieves the subcontractor
from such liability. In the absence of such approval, the
subcontract shall contain appropriate provisions requiring the
return of all Government property in as good condition as when
received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for its use in
accordance with the provisions of the prime Contract.</li>
<li value="6">Upon loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government
property provided under this Contract, the Contractor shall so
notify the Contracting Officer and shall communicate with the loss
and salvage organization, if any, designated by the Contracting
Officer. With the assistance of any such organization, the
Contractor shall take all reasonable action to protect the
Government property from further damage, separate the damaged and
undamaged Government property, put all the affected Government
property in the best possible order, and furnish to the Contracting
Officer a statement of:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the lost, destroyed, or damaged Government
property;</li>
<li value="2">the time and origin of the loss, destruction, or
damage;</li>
<li value="3">all known interests in commingled property of which the
Government property is a part; and</li>
<li value="4">the insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in
such commingled property.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="7">The Contractor shall repair, renovate, and take such
other action with respect to damaged Government property as the
Contracting Officer directs. If the Government property is
destroyed or damaged beyond practical repair, or is damaged and so
commingled or combined with property of others (including the
Contractor's) that separation is impractical, the Contractor may,
with the approval of and subject to any conditions imposed by the
Contracting Officer, sell such property for the account of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or
the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government. Such sales may be made in order to minimize
the loss to the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government, to permit the resumption of
business, or to accomplish a similar purpose. The Contractor shall
be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Price for
the expenditures made in performing the obligations under this
subparagraph (g)7. in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.
However, the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government may directly reimburse the loss and
salvage organization for any of their charges. The Contracting
Officer shall give due regard to the Contractor's liability under
this paragraph (g) when making any such equitable adjustment.</li>
<li value="8">The Contractor shall not be reimbursed for, and shall
not include as an item of overhead, the cost of insurance or of any
reserve covering risk of loss or destruction of, or damage to,
Government property, except to the extent that <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may have
expressly required the Contractor to carry such insurance under
another provision of this Contract.</li>
<li value="9">In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or
otherwise compensated for any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
Government property, the Contractor shall use the proceeds to
repair, renovate, or replace the lost, destroyed, or damaged
Government property or shall otherwise credit the proceeds to, or
equitably reimburse, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government, as directed by the
Contracting Officer.</li>
<li value="10">The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>'s
or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government's rights to recover against third parties
for any loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property.
Upon the request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall,
at <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>'s or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government's expense, furnish to that party
all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment
in favour of that party) in obtaining recovery. In addition, where
a subcontractor has not been relieved from liability for any loss
or destruction of, or damage to, Government property, the
Contractor shall enforce, for the benefit of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
Government, the liability of the subcontractor for such loss,
destruction, or damage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="8">Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an
equitable adjustment, it shall be made to any affected Contract
provision in accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause,
if applicable, or the clause that establishes procedures for
amending the Contract. When appropriate, the Contracting Officer
may initiate an equitable adjustment in favour of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the
Contractor's exclusive remedy. Neither <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> nor the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government
shall be liable to suit for breach of Contract for:
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">any delay in delivery of Government-furnished
property;</li>
<li value="2">delivery of Government-furnished property in a
condition not suitable for its intended use;</li>
<li value="3">a decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished
property; or</li>
<li value="4">failure to repair or replace Government property for
which the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government is responsible.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="9">Final accounting and disposition of Government
property. Upon completing this Contract, or at such earlier dates
as may be fixed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall
submit, in a form acceptable to the Contracting Officer, inventory
schedules covering all items of Government property not consumed in
performing this Contract or delivered to the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government. The
Contractor shall prepare for shipment, deliver <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> origin, or
dispose of the Government property as may be directed or authorized
by the Contracting Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal
shall be credited to the cost of the Work covered by this Contract
or paid to <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government as directed by the
Contracting Officer. The foregoing provisions shall apply to scrap
from Government property; provided, however, that the Contracting
Officer may authorize or direct the Contractor to omit from such
inventory schedules any scrap consisting of faulty castings or
forgings or of cutting and processing waste, such as chips,
cuttings, borings, turnings, short ends, circles, trimmings,
clippings, and remnants, and to dispose of such scrap in accordance
with the Contractor's normal practice and account for it as a part
of general overhead or other reimbursable costs in accordance with
the Contractor's established accounting procedures.</li>
<li value="10">Abandonment and restoration of Contractor premises.
Unless otherwise provided herein, the Government:
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">may abandon any Government property in place, at
which time all obligations of the Government regarding such
abandoned property shall cease; and</li>
<li value="2">has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the
Contractor's premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment,
disposition upon completion of need, or Contract completion).
However, if the Government-furnished property (listed in the
Schedule or specifications) is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the
intended use, or if other Government property is substituted, then
the equitable adjustment under paragraph (h) of this clause may
properly include restoration or rehabilitation costs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="11">Communications. All communications under this clause
shall be in writing.</li>
