Every right, remedy, power and discretion vested in or acquired by <em>Canada</em> 
or the <em>Minister</em> under the <em>Contract</em> or by law shall be cumulative and 
non-exclusive.


<strong>9601   03     (04/01/94)    Status of the Contractor</strong>

The <em>Contractor</em> is engaged as an independent <em>Contractor</em> for the sole purpose 
of performing the <em>Work</em>.  Neither the <em>Contractor</em> nor any of its personnel is 
engaged as an employee, servant or agent of <em>Canada</em>.  The <em>Contractor</em> is 
responsible for all deductions and remittances required by law in relation 
to its employees including those required for <em>Canada</em> or Quebec Pension 
Plans, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, or income tax.


<strong>9601   04     (04/01/94)    Amendments and Waivers</strong>

1.     No design change, modification to the <em>Work</em>, or amendment to the <em>
       Contract</em> shall be binding unless it is incorporated into the <em>
       Contract</em> by written amendment or design change memorandum executed 
       by the authorized representatives of the <em>Minister</em> and of the <em>
       Contractor</em>.

2.     While the <em>Contractor</em> may discuss any proposed changes or 
       modifications to the scope of the <em>Work</em> with the <em>Technical Authority</em>, <em>
       Canada</em> shall not be liable for the cost of any such change or 
       modification until it has been incorporated into the <em>Contract</em> in 
       accordance with subsection 1.

3.     No waiver shall be valid, binding or affect the rights of the 
       Parties unless it is made in writing by, in the case of a waiver by <em>
       Canada</em>, the <em>Contracting Authority</em> and, in the case of a waiver by 
       the <em>Contractor</em>, the authorized representative of the <em>Contractor</em>.

4.     The waiver by a <em>Party</em> of a breach of any term or condition of the <em>
       Contract</em> shall not prevent the enforcement of that term or condition 
       by that <em>Party</em> in the case of a subsequent breach, and shall not be 
       deemed or construed a waiver of any subsequent breach.


<strong>9601   05     (04/01/94)    Conduct of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Contractor</em> represents and warrants that:

       (a)    it is competent to perform the <em>Work</em>; and 
       (b)    it has the necessary qualifications, including knowledge, 
              skill and experience, to perform the <em>Work</em>, together with the 
              ability to use those qualifications effectively for that 
              purpose.

2.     Except for <em>Government Property</em> specifically provided for in the <em>
       Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall supply everything necessary for the 
       performance of the <em>Work</em>, including all the resources, facilities, 
       labour and supervision, management, services, equipment, materials, 
       drawings, technical data, technical assistance, engineering services, 
       inspection and quality assurance procedures, and planning necessary 
       to perform the <em>Work</em>.

3.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall:

       (a)    carry out the <em>Work</em> in a diligent and efficient manner;

       (b)    apply as a minimum quality assurance tests, inspections and 
              controls consistent with those in general usage in the trade 
              and that are reasonably calculated to ensure the degree of 
              quality required by the <em>Contract</em>; and

       (c)    ensure that the <em>Work</em>:

              (1)    is of proper quality, material and workmanship;

              (2)    is in full conformity with the <em>Specifications</em>; and

              (3)    meets all other requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.

4.     Unless the <em>Minister</em> orders the <em>Work</em> or part thereof to be suspended 
       pursuant to section 25 (Suspension of the Work), the <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall not stop or suspend any part of the <em>Work</em> pending the 
       settlement or resolution of any difference between the Parties 
       arising out of the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall provide such reports on the performance of the <em>
       Work</em> as are required by the <em>Contract</em> and such other reports as may 
       reasonably be required by the <em>Minister</em> or the <em>Technical Authority</em>.

6.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall be fully responsible for performing the <em>Work</em> 
       and <em>Canada</em> shall not be liable for any negative consequences or 
       extra costs arising out of the <em>Contractor</em>'s following any advice 
       given by <em>Canada</em>, whether given without or upon invitation by the <em>
       Contractor</em>, unless the advice was provided to the <em>Contractor</em> in 
       writing by the <em>Contracting Authority</em> and was accompanied by a 
       statement specifically relieving the <em>Contractor</em> of any 
       responsibility for negative consequences or extra costs that might 
       arise from following the advice.


<strong>9601   06     (04/01/94)    Compliance with Applicable Laws</strong>

The <em>Contractor</em> shall comply with all laws applicable to the performance of 
the <em>Work</em> or any part thereof including, without limitation, all laws 
concerning health and labour conditions and the protection of the 
environment, and shall require compliance therewith by all of its 
subcontractors.  Evidence of compliance with such laws shall be furnished 
by the <em>Contractor</em> to the <em>Contracting Authority</em> at such times as the <em>
Contracting Authority</em> may reasonably request.


<strong>9601   07     (04/01/94)    Specifications</strong>

1.     Except as otherwise provided in the intellectual property provisions 
       of the <em>Contract</em> or in any notice to the <em>Contractor</em> containing the <em>
       Minister</em>'s prior written consent to the contrary, the <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall use <em>Specifications</em> supplied by or on behalf of <em>Canada</em> solely 
       for the purpose of carrying out the <em>Work</em>.
 
2.     <em>Specifications</em> supplied to the <em>Contractor</em> by or on behalf of <em>Canada</em> 
       shall remain the property of <em>Canada</em> or, if those <em>Specifications</em> are 
       owned by a third party, of the third-party owner.  Upon notice the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall return those <em>Specifications</em> to the <em>Contracting 
       Authority</em> within the time specified in the notice.

3.     Where, pursuant to the terms of the <em>Contract</em>, <em>Specifications</em> 
       furnished by the <em>Contractor</em> are subject to approval by the <em>Minister</em> 
       or the <em>Technical Authority</em>, such approval shall not relieve the <em>
       Contractor</em> of its responsibility to complete the <em>Work</em> and to meet 
       all requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.  Any such approval shall not be 
       unreasonably withheld.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> agrees to accept and be bound by the Inspection or 
       Quality Assurance Authority's interpretation of the <em>Specifications</em>, 
       insofar as such an interpretation is not inconsistent with any other 
       part of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>9601   08     (04/01/94)    Subcontracting</strong>

1.     Unless otherwise provided in the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall 
       obtain the consent of the <em>Minister</em> in writing prior to <em>Subcontract</em>
       ing or permitting the <em>Subcontract</em>ing of any portion of the <em>Work</em> at 
       any tier. The <em>Minister</em> shall not unreasonably withhold consent.

2.     Notwithstanding subsection 1, the <em>Contractor</em> may, without prior 
       consent of the <em>Minister</em>:

       (a)    purchase "off-the-shelf" items and software and such standard 
              articles and materials as are ordinarily produced by 
              manufacturers in the normal course of business;

       (b)    <em>Subcontract</em> for the provision of such incidental services as 
              might ordinarily be subcontracted in performing the <em>Work</em>;

       (c)    in addition to purchases and services referred to in 
              paragraphs (a) and (b), subcontract any part or parts of the <em>
              Work</em> to one or more subcontractors up to a total value in the 
              aggregate of 40 percent of the <em>Contract</em> Price; and

       (d)    permit its subcontractors at any tier to make purchases or 
              subcontract as permitted in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).

       A <em>Subcontract</em> at any tier may not be let without consent, under 
       paragraph (b), (c) or (d), where the Subcontractor would obtain 
       title to intellectual property developed as part of the <em>Work</em>.

3.     In any <em>Subcontract</em> other than a <em>Subcontract</em> referred to in paragraph 
       2 (a), the <em>Contractor</em> shall, unless the <em>Minister</em> otherwise consents 
       in writing, ensure that the subcontractor is bound by terms and 
       conditions compatible with and, in the opinion of the <em>Minister</em>, not 
       less favourable to <em>Canada</em> than the terms and conditions of the <em>
       Contract</em>. Deviations in any <em>Subcontract</em> from the terms of the <em>
       Contract</em>, including any right of termination of the <em>Contract</em>, shall 
       be entirely at the risk of the <em>Contractor</em>.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> is not obliged to seek consent to subcontracts 
       specifically authorized in the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     Any consent to a <em>Subcontract</em> shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from 
       its obligations under the <em>Contract</em> or be construed as authorizing 
       any liability on the part of <em>Canada</em> or the <em>Minister</em> to a 
       subcontractor.


<strong>9601   09     (04/01/94)    Replacement of Personnel</strong>

1.     When specific persons have been named in the <em>Contract</em> as the persons 
       who must perform the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall provide the services 
       of the persons so named unless the <em>Contractor</em> is unable to do so for 
       reasons beyond its control. 
2.     If at any time the <em>Contractor</em> is unable to provide the services of 
       any specific person named in the <em>Contract</em>, it shall provide a 
       replacement person with similar qualifications and  experience.  The <em>
       Contractor</em> shall, as soon as possible, give notice to the <em>Minister</em> 
       of:

       (a)    the reason for the removal of the named person from the <em>Work</em>;

       (b)    the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed 
              replacement person; and

       (c)    proof that the person has the required security clearance 
              granted by <em>Canada</em>, if applicable.

3.     The <em>Minister</em> may order the removal from the <em>Work</em> of any such 
       replacement person and the <em>Contractor</em> shall immediately remove the 
       person from the <em>Work</em> and shall, in accordance with subsection 2, 
       secure a further replacement.

4.     The fact that the <em>Minister</em> does not order the removal of a 
       replacement person from the <em>Work</em> shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> 
       from its responsibility to meet the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>9601   10     (04/01/94)    Assignment</strong>

1.     The <em>Contract</em> shall not be assigned, in whole or in part, by the <em>
       Contractor</em> without the prior consent in writing of the <em>Minister</em> and 
       any purported assignment made without that consent is void and of no 
       effect.

2.     No assignment of the <em>Contract</em> shall relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from any 
       obligation under the <em>Contract</em> or impose any liability upon <em>Canada</em> or 
       the <em>Minister</em>, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the <em>Minister</em>.


<strong>9601   11     (04/01/94)    Time of the Essence</strong>

Time is of the essence of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>9601   12     (04/01/94)    Excusable Delay</strong>

1.     A delay in the performance by the <em>Contractor</em> of any obligation under 
       the <em>Contract</em> which is caused solely by an event that

       (a)    was beyond the reasonable control of the <em>Contractor</em>,

       (b)    could not reasonably have been foreseen,

       (c)    could not reasonably have been prevented by means reasonably 
              available to the <em>Contractor</em>, and

       (d)    occurred without the fault or neglect of the <em>Contractor</em>,

       shall, subject to subsections 2, 3 and 4, constitute an "Excusable 
       Delay" provided that the <em>Contractor</em> invokes this section by notice 
       under subsection 4.

2.     If any delay in the <em>Contractor</em>'s performance of any obligation under 
       the <em>Contract</em> is caused by a delay of a Subcontractor, such a delay 
       may constitute an Excusable Delay for the <em>Contractor</em>, but only if 
       the delay of the Subcontractor meets the criteria set out in this 
       section for an Excusable Delay by the <em>Contractor</em> and only to the 
       extent that the delay has not been contributed to by the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     Notwithstanding subsection 1, any delay caused by lack of financial 
       resources of the <em>Contractor</em> or an event that is a ground for 
       termination provided for in subsection 26(2) (Default by the <em>
       Contractor</em>), or any delay in the <em>Contractor</em> fulfilling an obligation 
       to deliver a bond, guarantee, letter of credit or other security 
       relating to performance or the payment of money, shall not qualify 
       as an Excusable Delay.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall not benefit from an Excusable Delay unless the <em>
       Contractor</em> has:

       (a)    used its best efforts to minimize the delay and recover lost 
              time;

       (b)    advised the <em>Minister</em> of the occurrence of the delay or of the 
              likelihood of a delay occurring as soon as the <em>Contractor</em> has 
              become aware of it;

       (c)    within 15 working days of the beginning of a delay or of the 
              likelihood of a delay coming to the attention of the <em>
              Contractor</em>, advised the <em>Minister</em> of the full facts or matters 
              giving rise to the delay, and provided to the <em>Minister</em> for 
              approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) 
              a clear "work-around" plan indicating in detail the steps 
              that the <em>Contractor</em> proposes to take in order to minimize the 
              impact of the event causing the delay; this plan shall 
              include alternative sources of materials and labour, if the 
              event causing the delay involves the supply of them; and

       (d)    carried out the work-around plan approved by the <em>Minister</em>.

5.     In the event of an Excusable Delay, any delivery date or other date 
       that is directly affected shall be postponed for a reasonable time 
       not to exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.  The Parties 
       shall amend the <em>Contract</em>, as appropriate, to reflect any such change 
       in dates.

6.     Notwithstanding subsection 5, the <em>Minister</em> may, after an Excusable 
       Delay has continued for 30 days or more, in the <em>Minister</em>'s absolute 
       discretion terminate the <em>Contract</em>.  In such a case, the Parties 
       agree that neither will make any claim against the other for damages, 
       costs, expected profits or any other loss arising out of the 
       termination or the event that gave rise to the Excusable Delay.  The <em>
       Contractor</em> agrees to repay immediately to <em>Canada</em> the portion of any 
       advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.  
       Subsections 26(4), (5) and (6) (Default by the <em>Contractor</em>) apply in 
       the event of a termination under this subsection.

7.     Except to the extent that <em>Canada</em> is responsible for the delay for 
       reasons of failure to meet an obligation under the <em>Contract</em>, <em>Canada</em> 
       shall not be liable for any costs or charges of any nature incurred 
       by the <em>Contractor</em> or any of its Subcontractors or agents as a result 
       of an Excusable Delay.


<strong>9601   13     (16/02/98)    Security and Protection of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall keep confidential all information provided to 
       the <em>Contractor</em> by or on behalf of <em>Canada</em> in connection with the <em>Work</em> 
       and all information developed by the <em>Contractor</em> as part of the <em>Work</em> 
       title to which vests in <em>Canada</em> under the <em>Contract</em>, and shall not 
       disclose any such information to any person without the written 
       permission of the <em>Minister</em>, except that the <em>Contractor</em> may disclose 
       to a Subcontractor authorized in accordance with section 8 
       (Subcontracting) information necessary to the performance of the <em>
       Subcontract</em>.

2.     Subject to the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c.Â A-1 and to 
       any right of <em>Canada</em> under this <em>Contract</em>, <em>Canada</em> shall not release or 
       disclose outside the Government of Canada any information delivered 
       to <em>Canada</em> under the <em>Contract</em> that is proprietary to the <em>Contractor</em> 
       or a Subcontractor.

3.     The obligations of the Parties set out in this section do not apply 
       to any information where the same information:

       (a)    is publicly available from a source other than the other <em>
              Party</em>; or
 
       (b)    is or becomes known to a <em>Party</em> from a source other than the 
              other <em>Party</em>, except any source that is known to be under an 
              obligation to the other <em>Party</em> not to disclose the information, 
              or

       (c)    is developed by a <em>Party</em> without use of the information of the 
              other <em>Party</em>.

4.     Wherever practical, the <em>Contractor</em> shall mark or identify any 
       proprietary information delivered to <em>Canada</em> under the <em>Contract</em> as "
       Property of (Contractor's name), permitted Government uses defined 
       under Department of Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC) 
       Contract No. (fill in Contract number)", and <em>Canada</em> shall not be 
       liable for any unauthorized use or disclosure of information that 
       could have been so marked or identified and was not.

5.     When the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Work</em>, or any information referred to in 
       subsection 1 is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, or 
       PROTECTED by <em>Canada</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall at all times take all 
       measures reasonably necessary for the safeguarding of the material 
       so identified, including those set out in the PWGSC <em>Industrial 
       Security Manual</em> and its supplements and any other instructions 
       issued by the <em>Minister</em>.

6.     Without limiting the generality of subsections 1 and 2, when the <em>
       Contract</em>, the <em>Work</em>, or any information referred to in subsection 1 
       is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL", or PROTECTED by <em>
       Canada</em>, the <em>Minister</em> shall be entitled to inspect the <em>Contractor</em>'s 
       premises and the premises of a Subcontractor at any tier for 
       security purposes at any time during the term of the <em>Contract</em>, and 
       the <em>Contractor</em> shall comply with, and ensure that any such 
       subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by the <em>
       Minister</em> dealing with the material so identified, including any 
       requirement that employees of the <em>Contractor</em> or of any such 
       subcontractor execute and deliver declarations relating to 
       reliability screenings, security clearances and other procedures.

7.     Any proposed change in the security requirements after the effective 
       date of the <em>Contract</em> that would involve a significant increase in 
       cost to the <em>Contractor</em> shall require an amendment to the <em>Contract</em> 
       under the provisions of section 4 (Amendments and Waivers).


<strong>9601   14     (04/01/94)    Payment</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, no payment 
       shall be made to the <em>Contractor</em> unless and until:

       (a)    an invoice, inspection notes, certificates and any other 
              documents required by the <em>Contract</em> have been submitted in 
              accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em> and the 
              instructions of the <em>Minister</em>;

       (b)    all such documents have been verified by the <em>Minister</em>;

       (c)    with respect to all parts of the <em>Work</em> in respect of which 
              payment is claimed, the <em>Contractor</em>, where required to do so, 
              establishes to the satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> that such 
              parts of the <em>Work</em> will be free from all claims, liens, 
              attachments, charges or encumbrances; and

       (d)    in the case of payment in respect of finished work, the 
              finished work has been inspected by <em>Canada</em> and accepted as 
              being in accordance with the <em>Contract</em>, including the <em>
              Specifications</em>.

2.     The <em>Minister</em> shall notify the <em>Contractor</em>, within 15 days of receipt 
       of an invoice, of any inadequacy of the invoice or of the supporting 
       documentation, and where any such notice is given within that period 
       the date for payment of the amount invoiced shall be postponed until 
       the <em>Contractor</em> remedies the inadequacy to the satisfaction of the <em>
       Minister</em>.

3.     Where a delay referred to in section 12 (Excusable Delay) has 
       occurred, the <em>Minister</em> may, at the <em>Minister</em>'s discretion, withhold 
       all or a portion of any payment due to the <em>Contractor</em> until a 
       "work-around" plan approved by the <em>Minister</em> has been implemented in 
       accordance with that section. Section 15 (Interest on Overdue 
       Accounts) shall not apply to any amount withheld under this 
       subsection.


<strong>9601   15     (30/10/96)    Interest on Overdue Accounts</strong>

1.     For the purposes of this section:

       "<strong>Average Rate</strong>" means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank Rates in 
       effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during the 
       calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in 
       which payment is made, where the "<strong>Bank Rate</strong>" means the rate of 
       interest established from time to time by the Bank of <em>Canada</em> as the 
       minimum rate at which the Bank of <em>Canada</em> makes short term advances 
       to members of the Canadian Payments Association.

       "<strong>date of payment</strong>" means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn 
       by the Receiver General for <em>Canada</em> and given for payment of an 
       amount due and payable;

       an amount is "<strong>due and payable</strong>" when it is due and payable by <em>Canada</em> 
       to the <em>Contractor</em> in accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em>; and

       an amount becomes "<strong>overdue</strong>" when it is unpaid on the first day 
       following the day upon which it is due and payable.

2.     Subject to the <em>Contract</em>, <em>Canada</em> shall be liable to pay to the <em>
       Contractor</em> simple interest at the Average Rate plus 3 percent per 
       annum on any amount that is overdue, from the date such amount 
       becomes overdue until the day prior to the date of payment, 
       inclusive. Interest shall be paid without notice from the <em>Contractor</em> 
       except in respect of payment which is less than fifteen (15) days 
       overdue.  No interest will be payable or paid in respect of payment 
       made within such fifteen (15) days unless the <em>Contractor</em> so requests 
       after payment has become due.

3.     <em>Canada</em> shall not be liable to pay interest in accordance with this 
       section if <em>Canada</em> is not responsible for the delay in paying the <em>
       Contractor</em>.

4.     <em>Canada</em> shall not be liable to pay interest on overdue advance 
       payments.


<strong>9601   16     (04/01/94)    Changes in Taxes and Duties</strong>

1.     In this section, "bid" includes a proposal, tender or offer 
       submitted by the <em>Contractor</em> in response to an invitation from the <em>
       Minister</em>.

2.     Subject to subsection 3, in the event of any change (including a new 
       imposition or repeal), on or after the date of submission of the bid, 
       of any tax, customs or other duty, charge, or any similar imposition 
       that is imposed under sales or excise tax legislation of the 
       Government of <em>Canada</em> and which affects the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> of 
       the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Contract</em> Price shall be adjusted to reflect the 
       increase or decrease in the cost to the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     There shall be no adjustment under subsection 2 in respect of any 
       change that would increase the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> of the <em>Work</em> if 
       public notice of the change was given before the bid submission date 
       in sufficient detail to permit the <em>Contractor</em> to have calculated the 
       effect on its cost before that date.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall forward to the <em>Minister</em> a certified statement 
       showing the increase or decrease in cost to the <em>Contractor</em> that is 
       directly attributable to the change in the imposition.  The <em>Minister</em> 
       may verify the increase or decrease in cost by audit before or after 
       the <em>Contract</em> Price is adjusted. 
5.     Notwithstanding subsections 2 to 4, no adjustment to the <em>Contract</em> 
       Price in respect of the <em>Work</em> or a part thereof shall be made for a 
       change in any imposition referred to in this section that occurs 
       after the date required by the <em>Contract</em> for delivery of the <em>Work</em> or 
       that part of the <em>Work</em>.


<strong>9601   17     (04/01/94)    Discounts, Wastes and Spoilage</strong>

1.     This section applies only to a <em>Contract</em> or part thereof that has a 
       cost-reimbursable basis of payment.

2.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall, as far as practicable, take all trade 
       discounts, rebates, refunds of taxes and duties, credits, and other 
       allowances available in carrying out the <em>Work</em>.  In determining the 
       cost of articles, materials and services of every kind to be paid by <em>
       Canada</em>, all trade discounts, rebates, refunds of taxes and duties, 
       credits and allowances not taken by the <em>Contractor</em> shall be deducted 
       from gross costs, except those not taken through no fault or neglect 
       on the part of the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall carry out the <em>Work</em> as economically as possible 
       and shall avoid waste and spoilage.  Where, in the opinion of the <em>
       Minister</em>, the character and value of spoiled or wasted materials 
       constitutes mismanagement on the part of the <em>Contractor</em>, the cost of 
       the spoiled and wasted materials shall, to the extent directed by 
       the <em>Minister</em>, not be considered to be part of the cost of the <em>Work</em> 
       and the <em>Contractor</em> shall not be reimbursed therefor.


<strong>9601   18     (04/01/94)    Inspection of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Work</em> and any and all parts thereof shall be subject to such 
       inspection as the Technical or <em>Inspection Authority</em> determines to be 
       appropriate, consistent with the relevant provisions of the <em>Contract</em>, 
       if any, prior to acceptance by <em>Canada</em>.  The <em>Contracting Authority</em> 
       and the Technical or <em>Inspection Authority</em>, or their representatives, 
       shall have access to the <em>Work</em> at any time during working hours where 
       any part of the <em>Work</em> is being carried out and may make examinations 
       and such tests of the <em>Work</em> as they may think fit.  Should the <em>Work</em> 
       or any part thereof not be in accordance with the requirements of 
       the <em>Contract</em>, the Technical or <em>Inspection Authority</em> shall have the 
       right to reject the <em>Work</em> and require its correction or replacement 
       at the <em>Contractor</em>'s expense.  The Technical or <em>Inspection Authority</em>, 
       as the case may be, shall inform the <em>Contractor</em> of the reasons for 
       any such rejection.

2.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall provide all assistance and facilities, test 
       pieces, samples and documentation that the Technical or <em>Inspection 
       Authority</em> may reasonably require for the carrying out of any such 
       inspection, and the <em>Contractor</em> shall forward such test pieces and 
       samples to such person or location as the Technical, Inspection or <em>
       Contracting Authority</em> may direct.  Inspection by the Technical or 
       Inspection  Authority shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from 
       responsibility to meet the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.

3.     No part of the <em>Work</em> shall be submitted for acceptance or delivery 
       until it has been inspected and approved by the <em>Contractor</em> and, 
       wherever practicable, marked with an approval stamp satisfactory to 
       the Technical or <em>Inspection Authority</em>. The <em>Contractor</em> shall keep 
       accurate and complete inspection records which shall, upon request, 
       be made available to the Technical or <em>Inspection Authority</em>, who may 
       make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom during the 
       performance of the <em>Contract</em> and for any period of time thereafter 
       provided for in the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>9601   19     (04/01/94)    Title</strong>

       intellectual property provisions, and except as provided in

       shall be liable for any loss or damage to any part of the <em>Work</em> 
       caused by the <em>Contractor</em> or any subcontractor after such delivery.

4.     Any vesting of title referred to in subsection 2 shall not 
       constitute acceptance by <em>Canada</em> of the materials, parts, 
       work-in-process or finished work, and shall not relieve the <em>
       Contractor</em> of its obligation to perform the <em>Work</em> in accordance with 
       the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     Where title to any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished 
       work becomes vested in <em>Canada</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall, upon the <em>
       Minister</em>'s request, establish to the <em>Minister</em>'s satisfaction that

       Defence Production Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. D-1, title to the <em>Work</em> or to 
       any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished work shall vest in <em>

       section 20 of that Act.


<strong>9601   20     (04/01/94)    Warranty</strong>

       behalf of <em>Canada</em> and without restricting any other provision of the <em>

       referred to in this section, less the duration of any delay by <em>
       Canada</em> in informing the <em>Contractor</em> of the defect or non-conformance 
       or in returning the <em>Work</em> or part thereof to the <em>Contractor</em>'s plant.  
       Upon returning the <em>Work</em> or part thereof to <em>Canada</em>, the <em>Contractor</em>

              Work</em>,

       provided that the <em>Contractor</em> notifies the <em>Minister</em> immediately of 
       any such claim, action, suit or other proceeding, but <em>Canada</em> shall 
       not be liable to indemnify or save harmless the <em>Contractor</em> for 
       payment of any settlement unless <em>Canada</em> has consented to the 
       settlement.

4.     The <em>Minister</em> shall give notice to the <em>Contractor</em> of any claim, 
       action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsection 2 and the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall, to the extent requested by the Attorney General of <em>
       Canada</em>, at its own expense participate in or conduct the defence of 
       any such claim, action, suit or proceeding and any negotiations for 
       settlement of the same, but the <em>Contractor</em> shall not be liable to 
       indemnify or save harmless <em>Canada</em> for payment of any settlement 
       unless it has consented to the settlement.

5.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall notify the <em>Minister</em> of all Royalties which it 
       or any of its subcontractors will or may be obligated to pay or 
       propose to pay in respect of carrying out the <em>Contract</em>, and the 
       basis thereof, and the parties to whom the same are payable, and 
       shall promptly advise the <em>Minister</em> of any and all claims which would 
       or might result in further or different payments by way of Royalties 
       being made by the <em>Contractor</em> or any of its subcontractors.
 
6.     Where and to the extent that the <em>Minister</em> so directs, the <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall not pay and shall direct its subcontractors not to pay any 
       Royalties in respect of the carrying out of the <em>Contract</em>.

<strong>9601   25     (04/01/94)    Suspension of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Minister</em> may at any time, by written notice, order the <em>
       Contractor</em> to suspend or stop all or part of the <em>Work</em> under the <em>
       Contract</em> for a period of up to 180 days. The <em>Contractor</em> shall 
       immediately comply with any such order in the manner that minimizes 
       the cost of so doing. While such an order is in effect, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall not remove any part of the <em>Work</em> from any premises 
       without the prior written consent of the <em>Contracting Authority</em>. At 
       any time prior to the expiration of the 180 days, the <em>Minister</em> shall 
       either rescind the order or terminate the <em>Contract</em>, in whole or in 
       part, under section 26 (Default by the Contractor) or section 27 
       (Termination for Convenience).

2.     When an order is made under subsection 1, unless the <em>Minister</em> 
       terminates the <em>Contract</em> by reason of default by the <em>Contractor</em> or 
       the <em>Contractor</em> abandons the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall be 
       entitled to be paid its additional costs incurred as a result of the 
       suspension plus a fair and reasonable profit thereon.

3.     When an order is made under subsection 1 and is rescinded:

       (a)    the <em>Contractor</em> shall as soon as practicable resume work in 
              accordance with the <em>Contract</em>;

       (b)    if the suspension has affected the <em>Contractor</em>'s ability to 
              meet any delivery date under the <em>Contract</em>, the date for the 
              performance of that part of the <em>Work</em> affected by the 
              suspension shall be extended for a period equal to the period 
              of suspension plus a period, if any, which in the opinion of 
              the <em>Minister</em> following consultation with the <em>Contractor</em> is 
              reasonably necessary for the <em>Contractor</em> to resume the <em>Work</em>; 
              and

       (c)    subject to section 4 (Amendments and Waivers), an equitable 
              adjustment shall be made as necessary to affected terms and 
              conditions of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>9601   26     (04/01/94)    Default by the Contractor</strong>

1.     Where the <em>Contractor</em> is in default in carrying out any of its 
       obligations under the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may, upon giving 
       written notice to the <em>Contractor</em>, terminate for default the whole or 
       any part of the <em>Contract</em>, either immediately, or at the expiration 
       of a cure period specified in the notice if the <em>Contractor</em> has not 
       cured the default to the satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> within that 
       cure period.

2.     Where the <em>Contractor</em> becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an 
       assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit of any 
       statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or where a 
       receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a receiving order 
       is made against the <em>Contractor</em>, or an order is made or a resolution 
       passed for the winding up of the <em>Contractor</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may, to 
       the extent permitted by the laws of <em>Canada</em>, upon giving notice to 
       the <em>Contractor</em>, immediately terminate for default the whole or any 
       part of the <em>Contract</em>.

3.     Upon the giving of a notice provided for in subsection 1 or 2, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall have no claim for further payment other than as 
       provided in this section, but shall be liable to <em>Canada</em> for any 
       amounts, including milestone payments, paid by <em>Canada</em> and for all 
       losses and damages which may be suffered by <em>Canada</em> by reason of the 
       default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including any 
       increase in the cost incurred by <em>Canada</em> in procuring the <em>Work</em> from 
       another source.  The <em>Contractor</em> agrees to repay immediately to <em>
       Canada</em> the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at 
       the date of the termination. Nothing in this section affects any 
       obligation of <em>Canada</em> under the law to mitigate damages.

4.     Upon termination of the <em>Contract</em> under this section, the <em>Minister</em> 
       may require the <em>Contractor</em> to deliver to <em>Canada</em>, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the <em>Minister</em>, any completed parts of the <em>
       Work</em> which have not been delivered and accepted prior to the 
       termination and any materials, parts, plant, equipment or 
       work-in-process which the <em>Contractor</em> has acquired or produced 
       specifically in the fulfilment of the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     Subject to the deduction of any claim that <em>Canada</em> may have against 
       the <em>Contractor</em> arising under the <em>Contract</em> or out of the termination, <em>
       Canada</em> shall pay or credit to the <em>Contractor</em> the value, determined 
       on the basis of the <em>Contract</em> Price including the proportionate part 
       of the <em>Contractor</em>'s profit or fee included in the <em>Contract</em> Price, of 
       all completed parts of the <em>Work</em> delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to a 
       direction under subsection 4 and accepted by <em>Canada</em>, and shall pay 
       or credit to the <em>Contractor</em> the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> that the <em>
       Minister</em> considers reasonable in respect of all materials, parts, 
       plant, equipment or work-in-process delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to 
       a direction under subsection 4 and accepted by <em>Canada</em>, but in no 
       event shall the aggregate of the amounts paid by <em>Canada</em> under the <em>
       Contract</em> to the date of termination and any amounts payable pursuant 
       to this subsection exceed the <em>Contract</em> Price.

6.     Title to all materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-process and 
       finished work in respect of which payment is made to the <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall, upon such payment being made, pass to and vest in <em>Canada</em> 
       unless already so vested under any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, 
       and such materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-process and 
       finished work shall be delivered according to the order of the <em>
       Minister</em>, but <em>Canada</em> will not accept and will not pay for materials, 
       parts, plant, equipment or work-in-process that would not have been 
       required to perform the <em>Work</em> or that exceed what would have been 
       required to perform the <em>Work</em>.

7.     Where, subsequent to issuance of a notice pursuant to subsection 1, 
       the <em>Minister</em> is satisfied that grounds did not exist for a 
       termination under this section, the notice shall be deemed a notice 
       of termination for convenience issued under subsection 27(1) 
       (Termination for Convenience).


<strong>9601   27     (04/01/94)    Termination for Convenience</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding anything contained in the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may, 
       at any time prior to the completion of the <em>Work</em>, by giving notice to 
       the <em>Contractor</em> (in this section sometimes referred to as a "
       termination notice"), terminate the <em>Contract</em> as regards all or any 
       part of the <em>Work</em> not completed. Upon a termination notice being 
       given, the <em>Contractor</em> shall cease work (including the manufacture 
       and procuring of materials for the fulfilment of the <em>Contract</em>) in 
       accordance with and to the extent specified in the notice, but shall 
       proceed to complete such part or parts of the <em>Work</em> as are not 
       affected by the termination notice. The <em>Minister</em> may, at any time or 
       from time to time, give one or more additional termination notices 
       with respect to any or all parts of the <em>Work</em> not terminated by any 
       previous termination notice.

2.     In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to 
       subsection 1, the <em>Contractor</em> shall be entitled to be paid, to the 
       extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for 
       purposes of performing the <em>Contract</em> and to the extent that the <em>
       Contractor</em> has not already been so paid or reimbursed by <em>Canada</em> 
       including the unliquidated portion of any advance payment:

       (a)    on the basis of the <em>Contract</em> Price, for all completed work 
              that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the <em>
              Contract</em>, whether completed before, or after and in 
              compliance with the instructions contained in, the 
              termination notice;

       (b)    the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> plus a fair and reasonable profit 
              thereon, for all work terminated by the termination notice 
              before completion, the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> being 
              determined in accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em> and 
              with <em>Contract</em> cost Principles DSS-MAS 1031-2;

       (c)    the amount of any capital expenditures actually incurred only 
              if they were specifically authorized under the <em>Contract</em> or 
              approved in writing by the <em>Minister</em> for the purpose of the <em>
              Contract</em>, less any depreciation in respect thereof already 
              taken into account in determining cost, to the extent that 
              the capital expenditures are properly apportionable to the 
              performance of the <em>Contract</em>;

       (d)    if the <em>Contract</em> is exclusively for the making of capital 
              expenditures in respect of additional equipment or plant 
              additions, in lieu of the amounts described in paragraphs (a) 
              to (c) inclusive, the reasonable and proper cost to the <em>
              Contractor</em> of:

              (1)    all additional equipment that, prior to the giving of 
                     the termination notice, has been purchased, acquired 
                     or manufactured by the <em>Contractor</em> or contracted for 
                     and for which the <em>Contractor</em> is obligated to make 
                     payment, and

              (2)    all additional equipment in process of manufacture by 
                     the <em>Contractor</em> at the date of giving of the 
                     termination notice and all work in connection with the 
                     construction of the plant additions to that date, 
                     including the cost of materials and parts <em>Contract</em>ed 
                     for by the <em>Contractor</em> for the purpose of such 
                     manufacture or construction and for which the <em>
                     Contractor</em> is obligated to make payment; and

       (e)    all costs of and incidental to the termination of the <em>Work</em> or 
              part thereof, including the cost of cancellation of 
              obligations incurred by the <em>Contractor</em> with respect to the 
              terminated <em>Work</em> or part thereof, the cost of and incidental 
              to the taking of an inventory of materials, components, 
              work-in-process and finished work on hand related to the <em>
              Contract</em> at the date of the termination, and the cost of 
              preparation of necessary accounts and statements with respect 
              to work performed to the effective date of the termination 
              and commitments made by the <em>Contractor</em> with respect to the 
              terminated portions of the <em>Work</em>; but not including the cost 
              of severance payments or damages to employees whose services 
              are no longer required by reason of the termination except 
              wages that the <em>Contractor</em> is obligated by statute to pay them 
              and except for reasonable severance payments or damages paid 
              to employees hired to perform the <em>Contract</em> whose hiring was 
              expressly required by the <em>Contract</em> or approved in writing by 
              the <em>Minister</em> for the purpose of the <em>Contract</em>.

3.     In paragraphs 2(c) and (d), "capital expenditures" includes the 
       entry into leases of real property and equipment.

4.     The <em>Minister</em> may reduce the payment in respect of any of the <em>Work</em> to 
       the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in meeting the 
       requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     Notwithstanding anything in subsection 2, the total of the amounts 
       to which the <em>Contractor</em> is entitled under paragraphs 2(a) to (d) 
       inclusive, together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to 
       the <em>Contractor</em> under other provisions of the <em>Contract</em>, shall not 
       exceed the <em>Contract</em> Price or the portion thereof that is applicable 
       to the part of the <em>Work</em> that is terminated, and shall not exceed the 
       proportion of the price quoted by the <em>Contractor</em> for all of the <em>Work</em> 
       that is reasonably attributable to the proportion of the <em>Work</em> 
       performed to the effective date of the termination.

6.     In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the <em>Contract</em> and in the subcontracting of any of the <em>Work</em>, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall, unless otherwise authorized by the <em>Minister</em>, place 
       purchase orders and subcontracts on terms that will enable the <em>
       Contractor</em> to terminate the same upon terms and conditions similar 
       in effect to those provided in this section, and generally the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall co-operate with the <em>Minister</em> and do everything 
       reasonably within its power at all times to minimize the amount of <em>
       Canada</em>'s obligations in the event of a termination under this 
       section.

7.     Title to all materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-process and 
       finished work in respect of which payment is made to the <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall, upon such payment being made, pass to and vest in <em>Canada</em> 
       unless already so vested under any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, 
       and such materials, parts, plant, equipment, work-in-process and 
       finished work shall be delivered according to the order of the <em>
       Minister</em>, but <em>Canada</em> will not accept and will not pay for materials, 
       parts, plant, equipment or work-in-process that would not have been 
       required to perform the <em>Work</em> or that exceed what would have been 
       required to perform the <em>Work</em>.

8.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of, or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of, any action taken or termination notice 
       given by the <em>Minister</em> under this section, except to the extent that 
       this section expressly provides.

       made by the <em>Contractor</em> in connection therewith, and shall keep all 
       invoices, receipts and vouchers relating thereto.  The <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall not, without the prior written consent of the <em>Minister</em>,
