<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The lowest priced valid offer will be recommended for use as a standing 
offer.

Offers achieving 70 points or more will be further evaluated taking into 
account the proposed Basis of Payment. The offer presenting the best value 
to the Crown when both technical merit and price are considered will be 
recommended for use as a standing offer.

The valid offer that scores the highest number of rating points will be 
recommended for use as a standing offer.

Neither the valid offer that scores the highest number of rating points, 
nor the one that contains the lowest cost estimate will necessarily be 
recommended for use. The selection of the Offerer will be made on the basis 
of the best overall value to the Crown in terms of technical merit and cost, 
which will be determined by dividing the proposed cost by the total 
technical score so as to establish the lowest cost per point.
