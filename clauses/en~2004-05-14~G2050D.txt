<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Bailee's Liability Insurance protects the Contractor against claims for damages 
cause by its negligence (in effect not accidental direct damage) to goods in its 
Care, Custody and Control (CCC) which are excluded under a Commercial General 
Liability.  In some instances, it may be possible to request deletion of the CCC 
exclusion under G2001D; however, more appropriately, a separate policy is 
recommended for contracts where services are exclusively of a Bailee nature.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $2,000,000 per loss is not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and the Risk 
Management and Insurance Advisor, Public Works and Government Services Canada 
(NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca).

Refer to G2015D for important additional endorsements that may apply to specific 
contracting areas.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Bailee's Liability insurance shall be effected by the Contractor and 
       maintained in force throughout the duration of the Contract in an 
       amount usual for a contract of this nature, but, in any case, for a 
       limit of liability NOT LESS THAN $2,000,000 per accident or 
       occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate.

2.     The policy must include the following endorsements:

       (a)    Additional Insured:  Canada is named as an additional insured 
              under any liability insurance policies for Canada's 
              respective rights and interests under the Contract.

       (b)    Notice of Cancellation:  The Insurer agrees to provide the 
              Contracting Authority thirty (30) days written notice of 
              cancellation.

       (c)    Cross Liability:  Without increasing the limit of liability, 
              the policy shall protect all insured parties to the full 
              extent of coverage provided.  Further, the policy shall apply 
              to each Insured in the same manner and to the same extent as 
              if a separate policy had been issued to each.

       (d)    Contractual Liability:  The policy shall, on a blanket basis 
              or by specific reference to this Contract, extend to assumed 
              liabilities with respect to contractual insurance provisions.

       (e)    Incidental Transit Extension:  To provide coverage for 
              incidents arising in due course of transit of goods.
