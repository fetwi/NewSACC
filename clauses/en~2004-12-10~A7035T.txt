<pre>If the Work includes the use of subcontractors, the names and locations of 
the subcontractors shall be listed as part of the bid with particulars of 
the Work to be performed or material to be purchased.  The Contracting 
Authority is to be notified, in writing, of any changes to the list of 
subcontractors prior to their commencing the Work.

For the purposes of this clause, there is no requirement to report the 
purchase of "off-the-shelf" items and software and such standard articles 
and materials as are ordinarily produced by manufacturers in the normal 
course of business, or the provision of such incidental services as might 
ordinarily be subcontracted in performing the Work.
