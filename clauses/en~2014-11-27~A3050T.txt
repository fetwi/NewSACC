<li value="1"><strong>Canadian good</strong>: A good wholly
manufactured or originating in Canada is considered a Canadian
good. A product containing imported components may also be
considered Canadian for the purpose of this policy when it has
undergone sufficient change in Canada, in a manner that satisfies
the definition specified under the <cite><a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/nafta-alena/index.aspx?view=d" rel="external">North American Free Trade Agreement</a></cite> (NAFTA) Rules of Origin. For the purposes of this
determination, the reference in the <abbr title="North American Free Trade Agreement">NAFTA</abbr> Rules of Origin to
"territory" is to be replaced with "Canada".(Consult <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/annex/3/6">Annex 3.6</a> (9)
of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>.)
</li>
<li value="2"><strong>Canadian service</strong>: A service provided
by an individual based in Canada is considered a Canadian service.
Where a requirement consists of only one service, which is being
provided by more than one individual, the service will be
considered Canadian if a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid
price for the service is provided by individuals based in
Canada.</li>
<li value="3"><strong>Variety of goods</strong>: When requirements
consist of more than one good, one of the two methods below is
applied:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">aggregate evaluation: no less than 80 percent of the
total bid price must consist of Canadian goods; or,</li>
<li value="2">item by item evaluation: in some cases, the bid
evaluation may be conducted on an item-by-item basis and contracts
may be awarded to more than one supplier. In these cases, suppliers
will be asked to identify separately each item that meets the
definition of Canadian goods.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4"><strong>Variety of services</strong>: For
requirements consisting of more than one service, a minimum of 80
percent of the total bid price must be provided by individuals
based in Canada.</li>
<li value="5"><strong>Mix of goods and services</strong>: When
requirements consist of a mix of goods and services, no less than
80 percent of the total bid price must consist of Canadian goods
and services (as defined above).
<br/>For more information on how to determine the Canadian content
for a mix of goods, a mix of services or a mix of goods and
services, consult <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/annex/3/6">Annex 3.6</a> (9), Example 2, of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>.</li>
