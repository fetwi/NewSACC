<h2 id="2014-11-272010Astatus-of-the-contractor">2010A 04 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent contractor engaged by Canada to
perform the Work. Nothing in the Contract is intended to create a
partnership, a joint venture or an agency between Canada and the
other Party or Parties. The Contractor must not represent itself as
an agent or representative of Canada to anyone. Neither the
Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee or
agent of Canada. The Contractor is responsible for all deductions
and remittances required by law in relation to its employees.</p>

<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, material supplied
must be new and conform to the latest issue of the applicable
drawing, specifications and part number that is in effect on the
bid closing date or, if there was no bid solicitation, the date of
the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Atime-of-the-essence">2010A 06 (2008-05-12) Time of the Essence</h2>
<p>It is essential that the Work be delivered within or at the time
stated in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Aexcusable-delay">2010A 07 (2014-09-25) Excusable Delay</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any
obligation under the Contract that is caused by an event that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">is beyond the reasonable control of the
Contractor;</li>
<li value="2">could not reasonably have been foreseen;</li>
<li value="3">could not reasonably have been prevented by means
reasonably available to the Contractor; and</li>
<li value="4">occurred without the fault or neglect of the
Contractor, will be considered an "Excusable Delay" if the Contractor
advises the Contracting Authority of the occurrence of the delay or
of the likelihood of the delay as soon as the Contractor becomes
aware of it. The Contractor must also advise the Contracting
Authority, within 15 working days, of all the
circumstances relating to the delay and provide to the Contracting
Authority for approval a clear work around plan explaining in
detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to
minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Any delivery date or other date that is directly
affected by an Excusable Delay will be postponed for a reasonable
time that will not exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="3">However, if an Excusable Delay has continued for
30 days or more, the Contracting Authority may, by giving
notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the Contract. In
such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim
against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other
loss arising out of the termination or the event that contributed
to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately
to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated
at the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Unless Canada has caused the delay by failing to meet
an obligation under the Contract, Canada will not be responsible
for any costs incurred by the Contractor or any of its
subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="5">If the Contract is terminated under this section, the
Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to
Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting
Authority, any completed parts of the Work not delivered and
accepted before the termination and anything that the Contractor
has acquired or produced specifically to perform the Contract.
Canada will pay the Contractor:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the value, of all completed parts of the Work
delivered to and accepted by Canada, based on the Contract Price,
including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee
included in the Contract Price; and</li>
<li value="2">the Cost to the Contractor that Canada considers
reasonable in respect of anything else delivered to and accepted by
Canada.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The total amount paid by Canada under the Contract to the date
of termination and any amounts payable under this subsection must
not exceed the Contract Price.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Ainspection-and-acceptance-of-the-work">2010A 08 (2008-05-12) Inspection and Acceptance of the
Work</h2>
<p>All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada.
Inspection and acceptance of the Work by Canada do not relieve the
Contractor of its responsibility for defects or other failures to
meet the requirements of the Contract. Canada will have the right
to reject any work that is not in accordance with the requirements
of the Contract and require its correction or replacement at the
Contractor's expense.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Awarranty">2010A 09 (2014-09-25) Warranty</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Despite inspection and acceptance of the Work by or
on behalf of Canada and without restricting any provisions of the
Contract or any condition, warranty or provision imposed by law,
the Contractor, if requested by Canada to do so, must replace,
repair or correct, at its own option and expense any work that
becomes defective or fails to conform to the requirements of the
Contract, where applicable. The warranty period will be 12
months after delivery and acceptance of the Work or the length of
the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty period,
whichever is longer.</li>
<li value="2">Canada must pay the transportation cost associated
with returning the Work or any part of the Work to the Contractor's
plant for replacement, repair or making good, and the Contractor
must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the
replacement or returning the Work or part of the Work when
rectified to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to
another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of
Canada, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location,
the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good
of the Work at that location and will be reimbursed its reasonable
travel and living expenses.</li>
<li value="3">The warranty period is automatically extended by the
duration of any period or periods where the Work is unavailable for
use or cannot be used because of a defect or non-conformance during
the original warranty period. The warranty applies to any part of
the Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to subsection 1,
for the greater of:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the warranty period remaining, including the
extension, or</li>
<li value="2">90 days or such other period as may be
specified for that purpose by agreement between the Parties.</li>

<h2 id="2014-11-272010Ainvoice-submission">2010A 10 (2014-11-27) Invoice Submission</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name.
The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment;
invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must
indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</li>
<li value="2">Invoices must show:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the date, the name and address of the client
department, item or reference numbers, deliverable/description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number
(CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial
code(s);</li>
<li value="2">details of expenditures (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price, fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as applicable) in accordance with the Basis of Payment, exclusive of Applicable Taxes;</li>
<li value="3">deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li value="5">if applicable, the method of shipment together with
date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Applicable Taxes must be specified on all invoices as a separate item along with corresponding registration numbers from the tax authorities. All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which Applicable Taxes do not apply, must be identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li value="4">By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Ataxes">2010A 11 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">
Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes.
</li>
<li value="2">
Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation. The Contractor agrees to remit to appropriate tax authorities any amounts of Applicable Taxes paid or due.
</li>
<li value="3">
The Contractor is not entitled to use Canadaâ€™s exemptions from any tax, such as provincial sales taxes, unless otherwise specified by law. The Contractor must pay applicable provincial sales tax, ancillary taxes, and any commodity tax, on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with applicable legislation), including for material incorporated into real property. 
</li>
<li value="4">
In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award. However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change. 
</li>
<li value="5">Tax Withholding of 15 Percent â€“ Canada Revenue Agency 
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite>Income Tax Regulations</cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite>Canada Revenue Agency.</cite> The amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.
</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Atransportation-costs">2010A 12 (2010-01-11) Transportation Costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Atransportation-carriers-liability">2010A 13 (2010-01-11) Transportation Carriers' Liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Ashipment-documentation">2010A 14 (2008-05-12) Shipment Documentation</h2>
<p>For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading
must accompany the original invoice, except for "collect" shipments
(if and when stipulated), in which event it must accompany the
shipment. In addition, a packing slip must accompany each shipment,
showing item, quantity, part or reference numbers, description of
the goods and contract number, including the <abbr title="Client Reference Number">CRN</abbr> and <abbr title="Procurement Business Number">PBN</abbr>. If the
goods have been inspected at the Contractor's plant, the signed
inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally
enclosed in the packing note envelope.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Apayment-period">2010A 15 (2014-09-25) Payment Period</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada's standard payment period is 30 days.
The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31<sup>st</sup> day following that date and interest
will be paid automatically in accordance with the section 16.</li>
<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
15 days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Ainterest-on-overdue-accounts">2010A 16 (2008-12-12) Interest on Overdue Accounts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">For the purpose of this section:

<dt>an amount becomes "overdue"</dt>
<dd>when it is unpaid on the first day
following the day on which it is due and payable according to the

</dl>
</li><li value="2">Canada will pay to the Contractor simple interest at
the Average Rate plus 3 percent per year on any amount that is
overdue, from the date that amount becomes overdue until the day
before the date of payment, inclusive. The Contractor is not
required to provide notice to Canada for interest to be
payable.</li>
<li value="3">Canada will pay interest in accordance with this
section only if Canada is responsible for the delay in paying the
Contractor. Canada will not pay interest on overdue advance
payments.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Aaudit">2010A 17 (2014-09-25) Audit</h2>
<p>The amount claimed under the Contract is subject to government
audit both before and after payment is made. The Contractor must
keep proper accounts and records of the cost of performing the Work
and keep all documents relating to such cost for six years
after it receives the final payment under the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Acompliance-with-applicable-laws">2010A 18 (2008-05-12) Compliance with Applicable Laws</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must comply with all laws applicable
to the performance of the Contract. The Contractor must provide
evidence of compliance with such laws to Canada at such times as
Canada may reasonably request.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must obtain and maintain at its own
cost all permits, licenses, regulatory approvals and certificates
required to perform the Work. If requested by the Contracting
Authority, the Contractor must provide a copy of any required
permit, license, regulatory approvals or certificate to
Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Aownership">2010A 19 (2008-05-12) Ownership</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, the Work
or any part of the Work belongs to Canada after delivery and
acceptance by or on behalf of Canada.</li>
<li value="2">However if any payment is made to the Contractor for
or on account of any work, either by way of progress or milestone
payments, that work paid for by Canada belongs to Canada upon such
payment being made. This transfer of ownership does not constitute
acceptance by Canada of the Work or any part of the Work and does
not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">Despite any transfer of ownership, the Contractor is
responsible for any loss or damage to the Work or any part of the
Work until it is delivered to Canada in accordance with the
Contract. Even after delivery, the Contractor remains responsible
for any loss or damage to any part of the Work caused by the
Contractor or any subcontractor.</li>
<li value="4">Upon transfer of ownership to the Work or any part of
the Work to Canada, the Contractor must, if requested by Canada,
establish to Canada's satisfaction that the title is free and clear
of all claims, liens, attachments, charges or encumbrances. The
Contractor must execute any conveyances and other instruments

representative of the Contractor.</p>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Aassignment">2010A 22 (2008-05-12) Assignment</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must not assign the Contract without
first obtaining the written consent of the Contracting Authority.
Any assignment made without that consent is void and will have no
effect. The assignment will be effective upon execution of an
assignment agreement signed by the Parties and the assignee.</li>
<li value="2">Assignment of the Contract does not relieve the
Contractor from any obligation under the Contract and it does not
impose any liability upon Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2014-11-272010Adefault-by-the-contractor">2010A 23 (2014-09-25) Default by the Contractor</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any
of its obligations under the Contract, the Contracting Authority
may, by giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate for
default the Contract or part of the Contract. The termination will
take effect immediately or at the expiration of a cure period
specified in the notice, if the Contractor has not cured the
default to the satisfaction of the Contracting Authority within
that cure period.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent,
makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the
benefit of any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors,
or if a receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a
receiving order is made against the Contractor, or an order is made
or a resolution passed for the winding-up of the Contractor, the
Contracting Authority may, to the extent permitted by the laws of
Canada, by giving written notice to the Contractor, immediately
terminate for default the Contract or part of the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">If Canada gives notice under subsection 1 or 2, the
Contractor will have no claim for further payment except as
provided in this section. The Contractor will be liable to Canada
for all losses and damages suffered by Canada because of the
default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including
any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work
from another source. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to
Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at
the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Upon termination of the Contract under this section,
the Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to
Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting
Authority, any completed parts of the Work which have not been
delivered and accepted before the termination and any materials,
parts, plant, equipment or work-in-process which the Contractor has
acquired or produced specifically in the fulfilment of the
Contract.</li>
<li value="5">Subject to the deduction of any claim that Canada may
have against the Contractor arising under the Contract or out of
the termination, Canada will pay the Contractor the value,
determined on the basis of the Contract Price, including the
proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee included in
the Contract Price, of all completed parts of the Work and the Cost
to the Contractor that the Contracting Authority considers

Contract. Once such a notice of termination for convenience is
given, the Contractor must comply with the requirements of the

not affected by the termination notice. The termination will take
effect immediately or, as the case may be, at the time specified in
the termination notice.</li>
<li value="2">If a termination notice is given pursuant to
subsection 1, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid, for costs
that have been reasonably and properly incurred to perform the

work that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the
Contract, whether completed before, or after the termination in
accordance with the instructions contained in the termination
notice;</li>

profit for all work terminated by the termination notice before
completion; and</li>

incurred by the Contractor but not including the cost of severance
payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer
required, except wages that the Contractor is obligated by statute
to pay.</li>

<li value="3">Canada may reduce the payment in respect of any part
of the Work, if upon inspection, it does not meet the requirements
of the Contract.</li>
<li value="4">The total of the amounts, to which the Contractor is
entitled to be paid under this section, together with any amounts
paid, due or becoming due to the Contractor must not exceed the
Contract Price. The Contractor will have no claim for damages,
compensation, loss of profit, allowance arising out of any
termination notice given by Canada under this section except to the
extent that this section expressly provides. The Contractor agrees
to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment
that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</li>

may set-off against any amount payable to the Contractor under the
Contract, any amount payable to Canada by the Contractor under the
Contract or under any other current contract. Canada may, when
making a payment pursuant to the Contract, deduct from the amount
payable to the Contractor any such amount payable to Canada by the
Contractor which, by virtue of the right of set-off, may be
retained by Canada.</p>

<p>The Contractor certifies that it has not, directly or
indirectly, paid or agreed to pay and agrees that it will not,
directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee for the solicitation,
negotiation or obtaining of the Contract to any person, other than
an employee of the Contractor acting in the normal course of the

<ol type="1">
<li>	The Contractor agrees to comply with the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite> and to be bound by its terms. In addition, the Contractor must also comply with the terms set out in these Integrity Provisions.</li>
<li value="2">	The Contractor confirms that it understands that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences may result in a termination for default under the Contract. If the Contractor made a false declaration in its bid, makes a false declaration under the Contract, fails to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested, or if the Contractor or any of the Contractor's Affiliates fail to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions during the contract period, such false declaration or failure to comply may result, following a notice period, in a termination for default under the Contract. The Contractor understands that a termination for default will not restrict Canadaâ€™s right to exercise any other remedies that may be available against the Contractor and agrees to immediately return any advance payments.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Contractor's Affiliates if: 
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be. </li>
<li value="4">	The Contractor who is incorporated or who is a sole proprietorship has already provided a list of names of all individuals who are directors of the Contractor or the name of the owner. The Contractor who has submitted a bid as a joint venture has already provided a list of names of all directors, or the name of the owner, for each member of the joint venture. The Contractor must diligently inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list of names of directors during the contract period. The Contractor must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms and associated information, and cooperate to the verification process.</li>
<li value="5">	The Contractor certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware, that Canada may verify the information provided by the Contractor, including the information relating to the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="6">	The Contractor certifies that neither the Contractor nor any of the Contractor's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Contract if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
<li value="7"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

The Contractor must therefore provide a copy of confirming documentation from an official source for its certification to be found true by Canada for the purpose of these Integrity Provisions. </li>
<li value="8">	The Contractor certifies that neither the Contractor nor any of the Contractorâ€™s Affiliates have been convicted of an offence or received a conditional or an absolute discharge under any of the following provisions, unless the time period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, has elapsed:

The Contractor also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Contractor nor any of the Contractorâ€™s Affiliates have been convicted or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions. Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to the Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council. 
</li>
<li value="10"><dfn>Subcontractors</dfn><br/>
The Contractor must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no less favourable to Canada than those imposed in the Contract.</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
