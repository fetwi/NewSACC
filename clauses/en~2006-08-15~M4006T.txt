<pre>1.     This procurement is subject to a preference for Canadian goods and/
       or services as defined in clause K4000D.

2.     On an item-by-item basis, items that include this representation and 
       warranty will be given preference over other offers, if there are 
       three or more suppliers who have submitted offers with a valid 
       certification.  Offers may be accepted in whole or in part.

3.     The Offeror represents and warrants that, of the goods and/or 
       services being offered, the following items are Canadian goods and/
       or services as defined in clause K4000D, and acknowledges that only 
       those items will receive consideration.

4.     The Offeror acknowledges that Canada relies upon such representation 
       and warranty to evaluate offers and to issue a standing offer as a 
       result of this request for standing offers.  Such representation and 
       warranty of Canadian content may be verified in such manner as 
       Canada may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by Canada disclose a breach of such covenant, 
       Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       Standing Offer as being in default.

6.     Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph and to include it with 
       the offer will result in all goods and/or services offered being 
       treated as non-Canadian.
