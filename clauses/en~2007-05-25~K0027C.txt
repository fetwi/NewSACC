<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>General conditions 1026A, Supplies - Firm Price, are amended by replacing 
section 08, Warranty, by the following:

       "08    Warranty

       1.     The Contractor, if requested by Canada, must replace or 
              repair at its own expense any finished work, excluding 
              Government Issue incorporated in the Work, which becomes 
              defective or which fails to conform to contract requirements 
              as a result of faulty or inefficient manufacture, material or 
              workmanship.

       2.     Despite acceptance of the finished work, and without 
              restricting any other term of the Contract or any condition, 
              warranty or provision imposed by law, the Contractor warrants 
              that the following will be free from all defects and will 
              conform with the requirements of the Contract: 

              (a)    The painting of the underwater portion of the hull for 
                     a period of ______ <em>(</em><strong><em>insert the number of days as 
                     required</em></strong>) days commencing from the date of undocking, 
                     except that the Contractor will only be liable to 
                     repair and/or replace to a value to be determined as 
                     follows:

                     Original cost to Canada of the underwater painting 
                     work, divided by ______ (<strong><em>insert the warranty period as 
                     indicated above</em></strong>) days and multiplied by the number of 
                     days remaining in the warranty period.  The resultant 
                     sum would represent the "Dollar Credit" due to Canada 
                     from the Contractor.

              (b)    All other painting work for a period of _______ (<strong><em>
                     insert the number of days as required</em></strong><strong>)</strong> days commencing 
                     from the date of acceptance of the Work;

              (c)    All other items of work for a period of ninety (90)

                            continuous use or service will be for a period 
                            of ninety (90) days from the date of acceptance 
                            of the vessel;

                     (ii)   for all outstanding defects, deviations, and 
                            work items listed on the Acceptance Document at 
                            Delivery, the warranty will be ninety (90) days 
                            from the subsequent date of acceptance for each 
                            item.

       3.     The Contractor agrees to pass to Canada, and exercise on 
              behalf of Canada, all warranties on the materials supplied or 
              held by the Contractor which exceed the periods indicated
