death of passengers in an amount that is not less than the amount
determined by multiplying $300,000 by the number of passenger seats

<li value="2">in addition to passenger liability limits in (a)
above, insurance covering risks of public liability in an amount

the policy must apply to each Insured in the same manner and to the
same extent as if a separate policy had been issued to each.</li>
<li value="4">Contractual Liability: The policy must, on a blanket
basis or by specific reference to the contract, extend to assumed
liabilities with respect to contractual obligations.

action brought against it, and Canada does not agree to a proposed
settlement agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and the
plaintiff(s) that would result in the settlement or dismissal of
the action against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the
Contractor's insurer for any difference between the proposed
settlement amount and the amount finally awarded or paid to the
plaintiffs (inclusive of costs and interest) on behalf of
Canada.</p></li></ol>
