<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in contracts when a proposed contractor has started 
work at its own risk without the authorization of a government official before 
contract approval, and the work has not been completed and the client department 
does not wish to retain the rights to the intellectual property.  This will 
ensure that the work done before the contract date will be covered by the 
contract. 

If the work has been completed, the contracting officer must instead request 
that a confirming order be prepared by legal counsel.

Use this clause in conjunction with C0210C.

Use clause A9094C when the client department wish to retain the rights to the 
intellectual property.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>In order for the Contractor to meet its obligations under the Contract, the 
Parties acknowledge that the Contractor has started the Work required 
pursuant to the Contract before the effective date of the Contract 
(Pre-contractual Work) and has incurred costs in the performance of such 
work.  Costs incurred by the Contractor in the performance of the 
Pre-contractual Work, that would have been treated as costs reasonably and 
properly incurred if they had been incurred after the effective date of the 
Contract, will be paid to the Contractor in accordance with the Basis of 
Payment of the Contract subject to acceptance of the Pre-contractual Work 
by Canada.  The Contractor agrees that upon such payment by Canada to the 
Contractor, Canada will be released and forever discharged from all manner 
of actions, claims, suits or demands in relation to the Pre-contractual 
Work.
