<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Bailee's Liability insurance protects the Contractor against claims for damages 
cause by its negligence (in effect not accidental direct damage) to goods in its 
care, custody and control which are excluded under a Commercial General 
Liability.  In some instances, it may be possible to request deletion of the 
exclusion (care, custody and control) under G2001D; however, more appropriately, 
a separate policy is recommended for contracts where services are exclusively of 
a bailee nature.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $2,000,000 per loss is not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and Public Works and 
Government Services Canada's Risk Management and Insurance Advisory Services, at 
NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca.

The contracting officer should also refer to G2015D for important additional 
endorsements that may apply to specific contracting areas and that are to be 
individually selected and included in the endorsements found in this clause.

              respective rights and interests under the Contract.

       (e)    Incidental Transit Extension:  To provide coverage for 
              incidents arising in due course of transit of goods.
