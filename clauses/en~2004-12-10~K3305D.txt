<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause where Canada is to own the foreground information and 
where supplemental general conditions 9601-7 form part of the Contract, if 
Canada is prepared, at the time of Contract, to consider granting the Contractor 
a license to exercise the Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground 
Information owned by Canada.

Article 9.1 of the Intellectual Property (IP) Policy states that Canada should 
not unreasonably refuse to grant a license to the Contractor for the 
Contractor's use of the Foreground Information.

Article 9.2 of the IP Policy states that where the reason which was invoked for 
Canada's ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground 
Information was either:

1. 	that the main purpose of the Contract, or of the deliverables contracted 
for, is to augment an existing body of Canada's background information rights as 
a prerequisite to their planned transfer to the private sector at a later date, 
through licensing or assignment of ownership to another person, for the purposes 
of commercial exploitation; or

2. 	that the main purpose of the Contract, or of the deliverables contracted 
for, is to deliver a component or subsystem that will be incorporated into a 
complete system at a later date, as a prerequisite to the planned transfer of 
the complete system to the private sector, through licensing or assignment of 
ownership, for purposes of commercial exploitation,

then when Canada grants a license for the Foreground Information, the license 
must be royalty-free.  The following clause applies in those circumstances.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Subject to subsection 2, if the Contractor wishes to make use of the 
       Foreground Information for purposes of its commercial exploitation 
       or further development, then the Contractor may make a written 
       request for a license to the minister for whose department or agency 
       the Work is being or was carried out.  Such a request should be made 
       within thirty (30) working days following completion of the Work.  
       The Contractor shall give that minister an explanation as to why 
       such a license is required.  That minister shall respond in writing 
       to any request for such a license within a reasonable period of time.  
       If the request is refused the response shall provide an explanation 
       for the refusal.  Should the minister for whose department the work 
       is being or was carried out agree to grant such a license, it shall 
       be on terms and conditions to be negotiated between the Contractor 
       and that minister.

2.     Where the Work under the Contract involves the preparation of a 
       database or other compilation using information or data supplied by 
       Canada, or personal information (as this term is defined in the <em>
       Privacy Act</em> (R.S.C., c. P-21)) collected by the Contractor as part 
       of the Work, then the license referred to in subsection 1 shall be 
       restricted to the Intellectual Property Rights in Foreground 
       Information that are capable of being exploited without the use of 
       such information or data or personal information.
