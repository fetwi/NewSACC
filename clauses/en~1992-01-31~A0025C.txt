<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The lowest priced valid proposal will be recommended for award of a 
contract.    Proposals achieving 70 points or more will be further 
evaluated taking into account the proposed Basis of Payment. The proposal 
offering the best value to the Crown when both technical merit and price 
are considered will be recommended for award of a contract.    The valid 
proposal that scores the highest number of rating points will be 
recommended for the award of a contract, provided that the estimated total 
price does not exceed the funds available for this requirement.    Neither 
the valid proposal that scores the highest number of rating points, nor the 
one that contains the lowest cost estimate, will necessarily be accepted. 
The selection of the Contractor will be made on the basis of the best 
overall value to the Crown in terms of technical merit and cost, which will 
be determined by dividing the proposed cost by the total technical score so 
as to establish the lowest cost per point.
