<h2>GI01 (2011-05-16) Code of Conduct for Procurement</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">To comply with the <cite>
Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>, bidders must respond to bid
solicitations in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner,
accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements
stipulated in the bid solicitation and resulting contract, submit
bids and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all
obligations of the Contract. To ensure fairness, openness and
transparency in the bidding process, the following activities are
prohibited:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">payment of a contingency fee by any party to a
contract to a person to whom the <cite>Lobbying
Act</cite> (1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. 44 (4th Supp.)) applies;</li>
<li value="2">corruption, collusion, bid-rigging or any other
anti-competitive activity in the bidding process for contracts for
the provision of goods or services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that
neither the Bidder nor any of the Bidder's Affiliates has ever been
convicted of a criminal offence in respect of the activities stated
in (a) or (b) above or is the subject of outstanding criminal
charges in respect of such activities filed subsequent to September
1, 2010.</li>
<li value="3">Bidders further understand that the commission of
certain offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a
contract. By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that neither
the Bidder nor any of the Bidder's Affiliates has ever been
convicted or is the subject of outstanding criminal charges in
respect of an offence under any of the following provisions:
<p>Section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor
subscribing to election fund</em>), Section 124 (<em>Selling or
Purchasing Office</em>), Section 380 (<em>Fraud committed against
Her Majesty</em>) or Section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to
Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> of Canada, or under
paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>)
subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or Section
154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial
Administration Act</cite>.</p>
</li>
<li value="4">For the purpose of this section, business concerns,
organizations or individuals are Bidder's Affiliates if, directly
or indirectly, 1) either one controls or has the power to control
the other, or 2) a third party has the power to control both.
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking
management or ownership, identity of interests among family
members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees,
or a business entity created following the charges or convictions
contemplated in this section which has the same or similar
management, ownership, or principal employees as the Bidder that is
charged or convicted, as the case may be.</li>
<li value="5">Except in the limited circumstances set out in
subsection 6 below, the Contracting Authority will declare
non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information
contained in the certifications contemplated above is determined to
be untrue in any respect by the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="6">Subsection 5 has no application in the circumstances
where a bidder has pled guilty of an offence contemplated in
Section 01, 1. (b) and the Bidder has provided with its bid an
assurance from the Competition Bureau of Canada indicating that the
Bidder has been granted leniency, or in the circumstances where the
Bidder provides documentation from the National Parole Board that
the Bidder has obtained a criminal pardon in relation to such
offence.</li>
<li value="7">The Bidder acknowledges and agrees that the
certifications contemplated must remain valid during the period of
any resulting contract arising from this bid solicitation.</li>

<h2>GI11 (2011-05-16) Acceptance of Bid</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may accept any bid, whether it is the lowest
or not, or may reject any or all bids.</li>
<li value="2">Without limiting the generality of paragraph 1) of
GI11, Canada may reject a bid where any of the following
circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Bidder's bidding privileges are suspended or are
in the process of being suspended;</li>
<li value="2">the bidding privileges of any employee or
subcontractor included as part of the bid are suspended or are in
the process of being suspended, which suspension or pending
suspension would render that employee or subcontractor ineligible
to bid on the Work, or the portion of the Work the employee or
subcontractor is to perform;</li>
<li value="3">with respect to current or prior transactions with
Canada
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the Bidder is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason,
its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li value="2">evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery,

<li value="3">Canada has exercised, or intends to exercise, the
contractual remedy of taking the work out of the contractor's hands
with respect to a contract with the Bidder, any of its employees or

contracts is sufficiently poor to jeopardize the successful
completion of the requirement being bid on.</li>
</ol>

</ol></li>
<li value="3">In assessing the Bidder's performance on other
contracts pursuant to subparagraph 2)(c)(iv)of GI11, Canada may

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the quality of workmanship in performing the

<li value="3">the overall management of the Work and its effect on
the level of effort demanded of the department and its
representative; and</li>
<li value="4">the completeness and effectiveness of the
Contractor's safety program during the performance of the
Work.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">Without limiting the generality of paragraphs 1), 2)
and 3) of GI11, Canada may reject any bid based on an unfavourable
assessment of the
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">adequacy of the bid price to permit the work to be
carried out and, in the case of a bid providing prices per unit,
whether each such price reasonably reflects the cost of performing
the part of the work to which that price applies;</li>
<li value="2">Bidder's ability to provide the necessary management
structure, skilled personnel, experience and equipment to perform
competently the work under the Contract; and</li>
<li value="3">Bidder's performance on other contracts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">Where Canada intends to reject a bid pursuant to a
provision of paragraphs 1), 2), 3) or 4) of GI11, other than
subparagraph 2)(a) of GI11, the Contracting Authority will so
inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder ten (10) days within which
to make representations, before making a final decision on the bid
rejection.</li>
<li value="6">Canada may waive informalities and minor
irregularities in bids received if Canada determines that the
variation of the bid from the exact requirements set out in the Bid
Documents can be corrected or waived without being prejudicial to
other Bidders.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GI12 (2010-01-11) Bid Costs</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">No payment will be made for costs incurred in the
preparation and submission of a bid in response to the bid
solicitation. Costs associated with preparing and submitting a bid,
as well as any costs incurred by the Bidder associated with the
evaluation of the bid, are the sole responsibility of the
Bidder.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GI13 (2010-08-16) Procurement Business Number</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canadian Bidders are required to have a Procurement
Business Number (PBN) before Contract award. Bidders may register
for a <abbr title="Procurement Business Number">PBN</abbr> in the Supplier Registration Information system, on the
Contracts
Canada Web site. For non-Internet registration, Bidders may
contact the nearest Supplier
Registration Agent.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GI14 (2010-01-11) Compliance with Applicable Laws</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">By submission of a bid, the Bidder certifies that the
Bidder has the legal capacity to enter into a contract and is in
possession of all valid licences, permits, registrations,
certificates, declarations, filings, or other authorizations
necessary to comply with all federal, provincial and municipal laws
and regulations applicable to the submission of the bid and entry
into any ensuing contract for the performance of the work.</li>
<li value="2">For the purpose of validating the certification in
paragraph 1) of GI14, a Bidder shall, if requested, provide a copy
of every valid licence, permit, registration, certificate,
declaration, filing or other authorization listed in the request,
and shall provide such documentation within the time limit(s) set
out in the said request.</li>
<li value="3">Failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph
2) of GI14 shall result in disqualification of the bid.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GI15 (2010-01-11) Approval of Alternative Materials</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">When materials are specified by trade names or
trademarks, or by manufacturers' or suppliers' names, the bid shall
be based on use of the named materials. During the solicitation
period, alternative materials may be considered provided full
technical data is received in writing by the Contracting Officer at
least 10 calendar days prior to the solicitation closing date. If
the alternative materials are approved for the purposes of the bid,
an addendum to the bid documents shall be issued.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GI16 (2010-01-11) Performance Evaluation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Bidders shall take note that the performance of the
Contractor during and upon completion of the work shall be
evaluated by Canada. The evaluation shall be based on the quality
of workmanship; timeliness of completion of the work; project
management, contract management and management of health and
safety. Should the Contractor's performance be considered
unsatisfactory, the Contractor's bidding privileges on future work
may be suspended indefinitely.</li>
<li value="2">The form PWGSC-TPSGC
2913, SELECT - Contractor Performance Evaluation Report Form,
is used to record the performance.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GI17 (2011-05-16) Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, bidders are advised that Canada may reject a bid in the
following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of
interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available
to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or
appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing
or has provided the goods and services described in the bid
solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the criteria established
above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and
provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that
it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to
have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within
Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of
interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest
or unfair advantage exists.</li>
</ol>
