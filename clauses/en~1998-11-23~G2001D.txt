<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Where the risks to third parties arising from work under the contract makes it 
necessary to ensure that the contractor is adequately insured and to protect the 
interests of Canada, the contractor must have Commercial General Liability (CGL) 
insurance or any equivalent insurance coverage.  CGL insurance must cover the 
risks to third parties (both on and off the contractor's premises) arising from 
work under the contract or from the operation or use of government property 
while in the care, custody or control of the contractor.

Third party liability risks due to the maintenance, repair, operation or use of 
government property while under the care, custody or control of the contractor 
may be covered by deleting the care, custody or control exclusion normally 
stipulated in the conditions of the contractor's CGL insurance policy.

If either the procurement officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $1,000,000 per accident or occurrence is not 
sufficient, the suggested limit may be established in consultation with the 
client and the Department of Public Works and Government Services' Risk 
Management and Insurance Advisor.
