<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Products Liability insurance protects the Contractor against claims for damages 
(principally property damage and bodily injury) caused by the products 
manufactured by the Contractor.  This coverage may be secured as a stand alone 
policy where the contract may warrant.

Alternatively, this insurance may be included in G2001D by invoking the 
endorsement (h), Products and Completed Operations Broad Form (24 months), of 
clause G2015D.  DO NOT USE BOTH.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $1,000,000 per loss is not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and Public Works and 
Government Services Canada's Risk Management and Insurance Advisory Services, at 
NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca.

The contracting officer should also refer to G2015D for important additional 
endorsements that may apply to specific contracting areas and that are to be 
individually selected and included in the endorsements found in this clause.
