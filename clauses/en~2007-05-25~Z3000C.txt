<pre>1.     This is an urgent United States (U.S.) government defence 
       requirement and use of a U.S. Priority Rating is hereby authorized 
       and assigned.  This Priority Rating is valid only for the purchase 
       of materials, sub-assemblies and components (excluding controlled 
       goods) by the Contractor directly from U.S. contractors up to a 
       total of US$ _____.  If the Contractor exceeds the dollar limitation, 
       the Contractor is authorized to proceed with the purchase order 
       while providing the Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, 
       Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), with details of 
       the additional amount required, either by e-mail at:<strong class="wsStyleUnderline"> NCR ACQB 
       <a href="mailto:DefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">DefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca</a></strong>, or by facsimile at 819-956-1459.

2.     The assigned U.S. Priority Rating, required delivery date, signature 
       of an individual authorized to sign rated orders, and the following 
       certification must be placed on or attached to the Contractor's 
       purchase order to U.S. contractors:

"This is a rated order certified for national defense use, and the 
Contractor is required to follow all the provisions of the U.S. Defense 
Priorities and Allocations Systems regulation (15 CFR Part 350)."
3.     Assigned U.S. priority ratings may not be extended within Canada. In 
       consequence, when further materials are imported through the 
       Contractor's Canadian subcontractors or distributors, the following 
       paragraph must be added in the Contractor's purchase order with the 
       Canadian subcontractor:

"PRIORITY ASSISTANCE: This is an urgent defence requirement.  If the 
Contractor is importing any material/service from U.S. for the fulfilment 
of the Contract, contact the Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, 
PWGSC, to request a U.S. Priority Rating."
4.     The Contractor must keep for a period of three (3) years, and 
       provide to Canada, on request, a record of its authority to use the 
       rating authorization and of all the uses made of it by the 
       Contractor.

5.     Special Priority Assistance:

       If the Contractor needs assistance in obtaining delivery under a 
       delinquent Rated Order with a U.S. contractor, the Contractor should 
       contact the Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, PWGSC.
