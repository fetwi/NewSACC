<pre>Suppliers who are subject to the Federal Contractors Program (FCP) and have 
been declared ineligible contractors by Human Resources and Skills 
Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer eligible to receive federal 
government contracts over the threshold for solicitation of bids as set out 
in the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em>.  Suppliers may be declared 
ineligible contractors either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by 
HRSDC, or following their voluntary withdrawal from the FCP for a reason 
other than a reduction of their workforce to less than 100 employees.  Any 
offers from ineligible contractors, including an offer from a joint venture 
that has a member who is an ineligible contractor, will be declared 
non-responsive.

The Offeror, or, if the Offeror is a joint venture the member of the joint 
venture, certifies its status with the FCP, as follows:
