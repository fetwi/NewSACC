<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Since September 10, 2001, ABE contains an edit that prevents the release of a 
contract to a Canadian company that does not have a PBN.  Therefore, the 
requirement for a PBN must be included in all solicitation documents processed 
through ABE.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     For procurement purposes, the Government of Canada uses a unique 
       Procurement Business Number (PBN) to identify a company and its 
       branches, divisions, or offices, where appropriate.  The PBN is 
       created using the entity's Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
       Business Number.

2.     All Canadian companies are required to have a PBN prior to contract 
       award in order to receive a Public Works and Government Services 
       Canada (PWGSC) contract.  In exceptional circumstances, PWGSC may 
       decide to award, at its own discretion, a contract to a company 
       without a PBN.  Non-Canadian companies are strongly encouraged to 
       obtain a PBN.

3.     Companies may register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration 
       Information (SRI) service on line at the Contracts Canada Internet 
       site at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://contractscanada.gc.ca</strong>.  In order for companies to be 
       sourced by government buyers, they must complete the registration 
       process and activate their account in the SRI service.

4.     For non-Internet registration, contact the Contracts Canada InfoLine 
       at 1-800-811-1148 or (819) 956-3440, in the National Capital Area, 
       to obtain the telephone number of the nearest Supplier Registration 
       Agent.
