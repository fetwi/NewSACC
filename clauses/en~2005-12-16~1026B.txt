       or materials, notify the Minister in writing of such proposed 
       subcontracts and shall furnish such particulars thereof as the 
       Minister may require.  The Contract shall not be assigned nor any of

aforesaid.  Such benefits lost through no fault or neglect on the part of 
the Contractor shall not be deducted from gross costs.

<strong>1026B  05     (1991-06-01)  Conduct of the Work</strong>

1.     The Contractor agrees to carry out the Work diligently and to 
       provide efficient supervision and inspection thereof and that the

       conformity with the specifications, drawings, models or samples, if 
       any.

2.     No materials or parts shall be used or processed and no finished 
       work shall be submitted for acceptance or shall be delivered unless

       practicable, marked with an approval stamp satisfactory to the 
       Inspector.  The Contractor shall keep proper and adequate inspection 
       records which shall at all times be open to examination by the 
       Inspector who may make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom.

3.     The Minister and the Inspector shall have access to the Work at all 
       times and to the plant and premises where any part of the work is 
       being carried on, and may make such inspections and tests of the 
       Work and of parts, materials and work in process as the Minister or 
       the Inspector may think fit.  he Contractor shall provide all 
       assistance and facilities, test pieces and samples which the

       location as the Minister or the Inspector may direct.  The 
       Contractor shall provide the Minister and the Inspector with such

       powers conferred upon them hereunder.

upon demand.

<strong>1026B  07     (1991-06-01)  Inspection</strong>

acceptance.  Should the Work be defective in materials or workmanship or 
otherwise not be in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, the 
Inspector shall have the right to reject the Work or to require its 
correction.  Inspection by the Inspector either at the plant of the 
Contractor or of any of its subcontractors shall not relieve the Contractor 
from responsibility for defects or other failure to meet the requirements 
of the Contract.  The Contractor agrees to accept and be bound by the 
Inspector's interpretation of the meaning of the specifications.

<strong>1026B  08     (2000-12-01)  Title and Acceptance</strong>

Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, title to the Work or any part 
thereof shall vest in Canada upon delivery to the consignee and acceptance 
thereof by the consignee.  Acceptance by the consignee of the Work or any 
part thereof shall be deemed to be acceptance thereof by Canada.

restricting any other term of the Contract or any condition, warranty or

Minister to do so at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of 
delivery, shall:

(a)    replace or make good at its own expense any finished work, excluding 
       Government Issue incorporated therein, which becomes defective or 
       which fails to conform to contract requirements as a result of 
       faulty or inefficient manufacture, material or workmanship

(b)    deliver such finished work free from all defects to the delivery 
       point specified in the Contract, unless otherwise agreed to by the 
       Minister;

provided that where, in the opinion of the Minister, it is not expedient to 
remove such defective finished work from its location, the Contractor shall 
replace or make good the defective finished work at such location, and 
shall be paid the actual cost incurred in so doing (including reasonable 
travelling and living expenses) with no allowance thereon by way of 
overhead or profit, less a sum equivalent to the cost of making good the 
defective finished work had it been made good at the Contractor's plant.

1.     All items comprised in any Government Issue shall be used by the 
       Contractor solely for the purposes of the Contract and shall always

       Contractor shall maintain adequate accounting records of all 
       Government Issue and shall mark the same as being Canada's property.

       in the Work) shall be returned to Canada upon demand, in the same

       from ordinary wear and tear or causes beyond the Contractor's 
       control.

       from any other materials, articles or things which are the property 
       of Canada, shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein,

       prescribed by the Minister.

<strong>1026B  11     (1991-06-01)  Spoilage and Defective Work</strong>

The Contractor shall carry out the Work as economically as possible and 
shall avoid waste and spoilage. If the character and value of any spoiled 
and wasted materials, or defective Work, in the opinion of the Minister 
constitutes mismanagement on the part of the Contractor, the cost of the 
spoiled and wasted materials and the cost of re-working the defective Work 
to the extent directed by the Minister shall not be considered as part of 
the cost of the Work and the Contractor shall not be reimbursed therefor.

<strong>1026B  12     (1999-12-13)  Care of Crown Property</strong>

Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, no insurance shall be carried 
by the Contractor on any property, title to which is vested in Canada,

property of Canada.  The Contractor shall take reasonable and proper care 
of all property, title to which is vested in Canada, while the same is in, 
on or about the plant and premises of the Contractor or otherwise in his 
possession or subject to his control and shall be responsible for any loss 
or damage resulting from his failure to do so other than loss or damage 
caused by ordinary wear and tear.

delayed by reason of force majeure or other cause beyond the reasonable 
control of the Contractor shall be extended by a period equal to the length 
of the delay so caused, provided that prompt notice in writing of the 
occurrence causing or likely to cause such delay is given to the Minister.

<strong>1026B  14     (1991-06-01)  Accounts</strong>

The Contractor shall keep proper accounts and records of the cost to the 
Contractor of the Work and of all expenditures or commitments made by the 
Contractor in connection therewith and such accounts and records together 
with the related invoices, receipts and vouchers shall be open to audit and 
inspection by the authorized representatives of the Minister (who may make 
copies thereof and take extracts therefrom) at any time until the 
expiration of six (6) years from the end of the calendar year in which the 
Contract is terminated or completed and the Contractor shall afford all 
facilities for such audits and inspections and shall furnish the Minister 
and his authorized representatives with all such information as he or they 
may from time to time require with reference to such accounts, records, 
invoices, receipts and vouchers.  The Contractor shall not, without the 
consent of the Minister, dispose of any such accounts, records, invoices, 
receipts and vouchers until the expiration of six (6) years from the end of 
the calendar year in which the Contract is terminated or completed, but 
shall preserve and keep the same available for audit and inspection at any 
time during such retention period.

       the Contractor by or on behalf of Canada in connection with the Work, 
       and all information developed by the Contractor as part of the Work,

       the written permission of the Minister, except that the Contractor 
       may disclose to a subcontractor, authorized in accordance with this 
       Contract, information necessary to the performance of the 
       subcontract. This section does not apply to any information that:

       (a)    is publicly available from a source other than the Contractor; 
              or

       (b)    is or becomes known to the Contractor from a source other 
              than Canada, except any source that is known to the 
              Contractor to be under an obligation to Canada not to 
              disclose the information.

2.     When the Contract, the Work, or any information referred to in 
       subsection 1 is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL or 
       PROTECTED by Canada, the Contractor shall, at all times, take all 
       measures reasonably necessary for the safeguarding of the material 
       so identified, including those set out in the Department of Public 
       Works and Government Services Industrial Security Manual and its 
       supplements and any other instructions issued by the Minister.

3.     Without limiting the generality of subsections 1 and 2, when the 
       Contract, the Work, or any information referred to in subsection 1 
       is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL or PROTECTED by 
       Canada, the Minister shall be entitled to inspect the Contractor's 
       premises and the premises of a subcontractor at any tier for 
       security purposes at any time during the term of the Contract, and 
       the Contractor shall comply with, and ensure that any such 
       subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by the 
       Minister dealing with the material so identified, including any

       payments analogous to royalties for, and also claims for damages

       proceedings for the payment of royalties in respect of anything, the

       hereinafter provided, the Contractor shall indemnify Canada against 
       claims, actions, or proceedings for the payment of royalties in

       use of or disposal by or for Canada of articles and supplies 
       furnished hereunder.

4.     The Contractor shall forthwith notify the Minister of all royalties 
       which the Contractor or any of its subcontractors will or may be 
       obligated to pay or proposes to pay for or in respect of the 
       carrying out of the Contract, and the basis thereof, and the parties 
       to whom the same are payable, and shall from time to time promptly 
       advise the Minister of any and all claims or arrangements made or 
       proposed which would or might result in further or different 
       payments by way of royalties being made by the Contractor or any of 
       its subcontractors. 
5.     If and to the extent that the Minister so directs, the Contractor 
       shall not pay, and shall direct its subcontractors not to pay any 
       royalties in respect of the carrying out of the Contract except with 
       the consent in writing of the Minister and subject to such 
       conditions as the Minister may impose.

6.     From and after the giving of any such direction, and subject to 
       compliance by the Contractor with the foregoing provisions, Canada 
       shall relieve and indemnify the Contractor from and against all 
       claims, actions or proceedings for payment of such royalties as are 
       covered by such direction.

       Canada a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to make, 
       have made and use for military purposes throughout the world and to 
       sell or otherwise dispose of any article or thing embodying or using

       purposes, including delivery to other governments for the 
       furtherance of mutual defense of Canadian and such other governments,

       statute for the time being in force relating to bankrupt or 
       insolvent debtors, the Minister may, by giving notice in writing to 
       the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of the Contract.  In 
       such event, the Contractor shall not be entitled to the payment of 
       any fee or any portion thereof with respect to any of the Work not 
       completed by the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the 
       Contract at the time of the said notice in writing to the Contractor.

2.     If after notice of termination of the Contract under the provisions 
       of subsection 1 of this section, it is determined by the Minister 
       that the default of the Contractor is due to causes beyond the 
       control of the Contractor, such notice of termination shall be 
       deemed to have been issued pursuant to section 25 of these general 
       conditions, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto 
       shall be governed by that section.

3.     Upon termination of the Contract under this section, the Minister 
       may require the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the Minister, any finished work which has 
       not been delivered and accepted prior to such termination and any 
       materials, parts, work in process or tools which the Contractor has 
       specifically acquired or produced for the fulfilment of the Contract. 
       Canada shall pay the Contractor for all such finished work delivered 
       pursuant to such direction and accepted by Canada, the cost to the 
       Contractor of such finished work plus the proportionate part of any 
       fee fixed by the said Contract and shall pay or reimburse the 
       Contractor the reasonable and proper cost to the Contractor of all 
       materials, parts or work in process delivered to Canada pursuant to 
       such direction.

       completed.  Upon such notice being given, the Contractor shall cease 
       Work (including the manufacturing and procuring of materials for the 
       fulfilment of the Contract) in accordance with and to the extent 
       specified in such notice but shall proceed with all reasonable speed 
       to complete such part or parts (if any) of the Work as are by the

       giving of any previous notice or notices.

2.     In the event of any notice given under the provisions of this 
       section, and subject as hereinafter provided:

       (a)    All Work completed by the Contractor hereunder before the 
              giving of such notice, and all Work completed thereafter 
              pursuant to such notice, shall be paid for (subject to 
              inspection and acceptance by Canada) in accordance with the 
              terms hereof;

       (b)    In respect of Work not completed hereunder before the giving 
              of such notice, and not completed thereafter pursuant to such 
              notice, Canada shall pay the Contractor's cost thereof as 
              determined under the provision hereof, and in addition an 
              amount representing a fair and reasonable profit in respect 
              of Work done thereon; 
       (c)    Subject as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection 2, if 
              the Contract shall have specifically authorized or if the 
              Minister shall have specifically approved the making of

              out the Contract, the Contractor shall be entitled to be 
              reimbursed the amount of such capital expenditures so 
              authorized or approved (and actually made or incurred) to the 
              extent that the same (less any depreciation in respect 
              thereof already taken into account in determining cost in 
              accordance with the provisions of the Contract) were 
              reasonably and properly incurred by the Contractor in respect 
              of and are properly apportionable to the performance of the 
              Contract;

       (d)    If the Contract is exclusively a Contract for the making of 
              capital expenditures in respect of additional equipment or 
              plant additions, the foregoing paragraphs (a) to (c) 
              inclusive of this subsection 2 shall not apply, but Canada 
              shall pay or reimburse the Contractor for the reasonable and 
              proper cost to the Contractor (not previously paid by Canada) 
              of:

              (i)    all additional equipment which, prior to the giving of 
                     the termination notice, shall have been purchased, 
                     acquired or manufactured by the Contractor, or 
                     contracted for and for which the Contractor is 
                     obligated to make payments, and

              (ii)   all additional equipment in process of manufacture by 
                     the Contractor as at the date of the giving of such 
                     notice and all Work in connection with the 
                     construction of the plant addition up to the said date, 
                     including the cost of materials and parts contracted 
                     for by the Contractor for the purpose of such 
                     manufacture of construction and for which the 
                     Contractor is obligated to make payment.

3.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1 and 2, the amounts 
       which the Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed in the event 
       of the giving of a termination notice under this section 25 shall 
       include, subject as hereinafter provided, the costs of the 
       Contractor of and incidental to the cancellation of obligations 
       incurred by the Contractor pursuant to the termination notice, the 
       cost of preparing the necessary accounts and statements with respect 
       to the Work performed to the effective date of such termination and 
       commitments made by the Contractor with respect to the terminated 
       portions of the Work, wages which the Contractor is obligated under 
       any laws or regulations for the time being in force, to pay to 
       employees whose services are no longer required by reason of such 
       termination, the costs of and incidental to the taking of an 
       inventory of materials, components, work in process and finished 
       work on hand at the effective date of the termination and other

       in part, of operations under the Contract provided always that 
       payment and reimbursement under the provisions of this subsection 
       shall be made only to the extent that is established to the 
       satisfaction of the Minister that the costs and expenses aforesaid 
       were actually incurred by the Contractor and that the same are 
       reasonable and are properly attributable to the termination of the 
       Work or the part thereof so terminated.

4.     In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the Contract and in subletting of any Work hereunder, the 
       Contractor, unless otherwise authorized by the Minister, shall 
       procure or sublet on terms that will enable the Contractor to 
       terminate any contracts entered into by the Contractor upon the same 
       conditions and terms as those provided for in this section in 
       respect of the termination of the Contract by the Minister and the 
       giving of a notice or notices as aforesaid and upon the same 
       conditions and terms in respect of reimbursement and profit as those 
       contained in this section and in the event of the termination of the 
       Contract as herein provided as regards all or any part of the Work, 
       the Contractor shall co-operate with Canada and the Minister and do 
       everything reasonably within its power at all times to minimize and 
       reduce the amount of Canada's obligations under the provisions of 
       this section.

5.     In case of disagreement as to the amount which the Contractor is 
       entitled to be reimbursed, the matter shall be referred to the 
       Federal Court.

6.     Upon reimbursement being made the Contractor as herein provided, 
       title to the materials, parts, plant, equipment and work in process 
       in respect of which such reimbursement is made shall pass to and 
       vest in Canada (the Contractor hereby agreeing to execute and 
       deliver all requisite instruments by way of further assurance) and 
       such materials, parts, plant, equipment and work in process shall be 
       delivered to the order of the Minister, but the materials thus taken 
       over will in no case be in excess of what would have been required 
       for performing the Contract in full if no notice has been given 
       under the provisions hereof.

7.     If it is established to the satisfaction of the Minister by the 
       Contractor that by reason of any action taken by the Minister under 
       the provisions of this section exceptional hardship has resulted to 
       the Contractor, then the Minister may, notwithstanding any other 
       provisions of this section, in his absolute discretion grant such 
       allowance (not to include in any case, however, any allowance or 
       compensation for loss of profit) to the Contractor as, in the 
       opinion of the Minister, is warranted by the circumstances.

8.     The Contractor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of any action taken or notice given by the 
       Minister under or pursuant to the provisions of this section except 
       as and to the extent in this section expressly provided.
