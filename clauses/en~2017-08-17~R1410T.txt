The Proponent must comply with the Policy and Directives, which can be found at <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em>.</li>
<li>Under the Policy, charges and convictions of certain offences against a Supplier, its affiliates or first tier sub-consultants, and other circumstances, will or may result in a determination by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) that the Supplier is ineligible to enter, or is suspended from entering into a contract with Canada. The list of ineligible and suspended Suppliers is contained in <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Integrity Database. The Policy describes how enquiries can be made regarding the ineligibility or suspension of Suppliers.</li>
<li>In addition to all other information required in the bid solicitation, the Proponent must provide the following:
      <ol type="a">
<li>by the time stated in the Policy, all information required by the Policy described under the heading “Information to be Provided when Bidding, Contracting or Entering into a Real Property Agreement”; and</li>

<h2 id="2017-08-17R1410Toverview-of-selection-procedure"><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI3 (2015-03-25) Overview of selection procedure
  </h2><p>The following is an overview of the selection procedure.</p>
<h3>3.1 Proposal</h3>
<ol>
<li>Proposals are submitted following a "two-envelope"
      procedure, in which Proponents submit the "technical" component of their proposal in one envelope and the proposed price of the services (price proposal) in a second envelope.</li>
<li>The information that Proponents are required to provide is set out in detail elsewhere in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>.</li>
<li>In response to the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>, interested Proponents submit a proposal in which they:
      <ol type="a">
<li>indicate whether the proposal is submitted by an individual firm or by a joint venture;</li>
<li>if the proposal is submitted by a joint venture, describe the proposed legal and working relationships of the joint venture and the benefits to be gained by the formation of the joint venture;</li>
<li>identify the prime consultants and key sub consultants and specialists proposed for inclusion in the Consultant Team, and the proposed organizational structure of the Team;</li>
<li>describe the extent to which proposed members of the Consultant Team have successfully performed services for projects comparable to the project which is the subject of the proposal;</li>
<li>identify the professional accreditation, experience, expertise and competence of the Consultant Team and Key Personnel proposed to be assigned to perform the required services.</li>
<li>comply with all other requirements set out in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Proposal evaluation and rating</h3>
<ol>
<li>Technical components of all responsive proposals are reviewed, evaluated and rated by a Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Evaluation Board in accordance with the criteria, components and weight factors set out in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>. Upon completion of the evaluation, Technical Ratings are established.</li>
<li>Proposals achieving the minimum Technical Score specified in the Submission Requirements and Evaluation section of the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr> are further considered.</li>
<li>The price envelopes of all responsive proposals are opened upon completion of the technical evaluation. When there are three or more responsive proposals, an average price is determined by adding all the price proposals together and dividing the total by the number of price proposals opened. This calculation will not be conducted when one or two responsive proposals are received.</li>
<li>All price proposals which are greater than 25 percent above the average price will cause their respective complete proposals to be set aside and receive no further consideration.</li>
<li>The remaining price proposals are rated as follows:
      <ol type="a">
<li>The lowest price proposal receives a Price Rating of 100.</li>
<li>The second, third, fourth and fifth lowest prices receive Price Ratings of 80, 60, 40, and 20 respectively. All other price proposals receive a Price Rating of 0.</li>
<li>On the rare occasion where two (or more) price proposals are identical, these price proposals receive the same rating and the corresponding number of following ratings are skipped.</li>
<li>The Price Rating is multiplied by a predetermined percentage factor to establish a Price Score.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A price proposal in excess of any maximum funding limit, when this limit has been set in the Supplementary Instructions to Proponents, may result in disqualification of the complete proposal.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.3 Total score</h3>
<ol>
<li>The total overall score (Total Score) assigned to each Proponent's complete proposal is calculated as the aggregate of:
      <ol type="a">
<li>the Technical Score (first envelope of the proposal), and</li>
<li>the Price Score (second envelope of the proposal).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Proponent receiving the highest Total Score is the first entity that the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Evaluation Board will recommend for the provision of the required services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.4 Notification</h3>

<li>A Proponent may not submit more than one proposal. This limitation also applies to the persons or entities in the case of a joint venture. If more than one proposal is received from a Proponent (or, in the case of a joint venture, from the persons or entities), all such proposals shall be rejected and no further consideration shall be given.</li>
<li>A joint venture is defined as an association of two or more parties which combine their money, property, knowledge, skills, time or other resources in a joint business enterprise agreeing to share the profits and the losses and each having some degree of control over the enterprise.</li>
<li>An arrangement whereby Canada contracts directly with a prime consultant who may retain sub-consultants or specialist consultants to perform portions of the services is not a joint venture arrangement. A sub-consultant or specialist consultant may, therefore, be proposed as part of the Consultant Team by more than one Proponent. The Proponent warrants that it has written permission from such sub-consultant or specialist consultant to propose their services in relation to the services to be performed.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding paragraph 3. above, in order to avoid any conflict of interest, or any perception of conflict of interest, a Proponent shall not include in its submission another Proponent as a member of its consultant team, as a sub-consultant or specialist consultant.</li>
<li>Any joint venture entered into for the provision of professional services or other services must be in full compliance with the requirements of any provincial or territorial law pertaining thereto in the Province or Territory in which the project is located.</li>

<li>an employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant included as part of the proposal has been declared ineligible, for selection for work with the department in accordance with the performance review procedure referred to in paragraph 1.(a), which would render the employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion of the requirement the employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant is to perform;</li>
<li>the Proponent is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>

<li>Financial capability Requirement: The Proponent must have the financial capability to fulfill this requirement. To determine the Proponent's financial capability, the Contracting Authority may, by written notice to the Proponent, require the submission of some or all of the financial information detailed below during the evaluation of proposals. The Proponent must provide the following information to the Contracting Authority within fifteen (15) working days of the request or as specified by the Contracting Authority in the notice:
      <ol type="a">
<li>Audited financial statements, if available, or the unaudited financial statements (prepared by the Proponent's outside accounting firm, if available, or prepared in-house if no external statements have been prepared) for the Proponent's last three fiscal years, or for the years that the Proponent has been in business if this is less than three years (including, as a minimum, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Retained Earnings, the Income Statement and any notes to the statements). </li>
<li>If the date of the financial statements in (a) above is more than five months before the date of the request for information by the Contracting Authority, the Proponent must also provide, unless this is prohibited by legislation for public companies, the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement), as of two months before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information. </li>
<li>If the Proponent has not been in business for at least one full fiscal year, the following must be provided:
          <ol type="i">
<li>the opening Balance Sheet on commencement of business (in the case of a corporation, the date of incorporation); and </li>
<li>the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement) as of two months before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A certification from the Chief Financial Officer or an authorized signing officer of the Proponent that the financial information provided is complete and accurate. </li>
<li>A confirmation letter from all of the financial institution(s) that have provided short-term financing to the Proponent outlining the total of lines of credit granted to the Proponent and the amount of credit that remains available and not drawn upon as of one month prior to the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information.</li>
<li>A detailed monthly Cash Flow Statement covering all the Proponent's activities (including the requirement) for the first two years of the requirement that is the subject of the bid solicitation, unless this is prohibited by legislation. This statement must detail the Proponent's major sources and amounts of cash and the major items of cash expenditures on a monthly basis, for all the Proponent's activities. All assumptions made should be explained as well as details of how cash shortfalls will be financed.</li>
<li>A detailed monthly Project Cash Flow Statement covering the first two years of the requirement that is the subject of the bid solicitation, unless this is prohibited by legislation.

All assumptions made should be explained as well as details of how cash shortfalls will be financed. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the Proponent is a joint venture, the financial information required by the Contracting Authority must be provided by each member of the joint venture. </li>
<li>If the Proponent is a subsidiary of another company, then any financial information in 1. (a) to (e) above required by the Contracting Authority must be provided by the ultimate parent company. Provision of parent company financial information does not by itself satisfy the requirement for the provision of the financial information of the Proponent, and the financial capability of a parent cannot be substituted for the financial capability of the Proponent itself unless an agreement by the parent company to sign a Parental Guarantee, as drawn up by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), is provided with the required information. </li>
<li>Financial Information Already Provided to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>: The Proponent is not required to resubmit any financial information requested by the Contracting Authority that is already on file at <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with the Contract Cost Analysis, Audit and Policy Directorate of the Policy, Risk, Integrity and Strategic Management Sector, provided that within the above-noted time frame:
      <ol type="a">
<li>the Proponent identifies to the Contracting Authority in writing the specific information that is on file and the requirement for which this information was provided; and </li>
<li>the Proponent authorizes the use of the information for this requirement. </li>
</ol>
      It is the Proponent's responsibility to confirm with the Contracting Authority that this information is still on file with <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>. </li>
<li>Other Information: Canada reserves the right to request from the Proponent any other information that Canada requires to conduct a complete financial capability assessment of the Proponent. </li>
<li>Confidentiality: If the Proponent provides the information required above to Canada in confidence while indicating that the disclosed information is confidential, then Canada will treat the information in a confidential manner as permitted by the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>., 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. A-1, section 20(1) (b) and (c). </li>
<li>Security: In determining the Proponent's financial capability to fulfill this requirement, Canada may consider any security the Proponent is capable of providing, at the Proponent's sole expense (for example, an irrevocable letter of credit from a registered financial institution drawn in favour of Canada, a performance guarantee from a third party or some other form of security, as determined by Canada). </li>
<li>In the event that a proposal is found to be non-compliant on the basis that the Proponent is considered not to be financially capable of performing the subject requirement, official notification shall be provided to the Proponent. </li>

  Conflict of interest—unfair advantage</h2>
<ol>
<li>In order to protect the integrity of the procurement process, Proponents are advised that Canada may reject a proposal in the following circumstances:
      <ol type="a">
<li>if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of their respective employees or former employees was involved in any manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li>if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of their respective employees or former employees had access to information related to the bid solicitation that was not available to other Proponents and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to give the Proponent an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The experience acquired by a Proponent who is providing or has provided the goods and services described in the bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating a conflict of interest. This Proponent remains however subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li>Where Canada intends to reject a proposal under this section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Proponent and provide the Proponent an opportunity to make representations before making a final decision. Proponents who are in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority before bid closing. By submitting a proposal, the Proponent represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Proponent acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
