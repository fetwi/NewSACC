<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in Canadian defence contracts awarded to United States 
(U.S.) contractors, for the provision of goods to be used directly in Canadian 
defence activities.  This will indicate to the U.S. contractors that a defence 
priority rating will be assigned and communicated to them shortly.

NOTE:

1.	A threshold of US$50,000 is included in the U.S. Defence Priorities and 
Allocations System regulations (15 CFR Part 700.17), where it is stated that for 
contracts under this value, a priority rating is not required "provided that 
delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of a priority 
rating."

2.	Tender Contract Distribution Unit will forward a copy of the Department of 
National Defence contracts, which have been awarded to U.S. contractors, to the 
Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer (DPAO), Public Works and Government 
Services Canada.  If the contracting officer wishes to provide a copy of the 
contract directly to the DPAO, it can be done by sending a PDF version of the 
contract to the following e-mail address: NCR ACQB Defence 
Priorities@pwgsc.gc.ca.

	Contracting officers must consult the Supply Manual, procedures 6B.195, 6B.196, 
and 7A.140 for more information on the application of a priority rating.
