<p>
  Use the following clause in contracts when the requirement is not subject to the
  <abbr title="greenhouse gas">
   GHG
  </abbr>
  Disclosure Standard but there is a requirement to include environmental considerations, and in competitive and non-competitive contracts when the
  <abbr title="greenhouse gas">
   GHG
  </abbr>
  Disclosure Standard applies but market readiness is low or cannot be determined.
 </p>
<p>
  Contracting officers must select one of the options provided.
 </p>
<p>
  Option 1: Use this option in resulting contract clauses for competitive requirements when point-rated evaluation criteria related to setting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions disclosure and reduction targets, or participation in the Net-Zero Challenge or equivalent are included in the solicitation but the successful bidder did not respond to the evaluation criteria. Alternatively this option can be included in competitive requirements where no solicitation clause was included, and non-competitive requirements subject to the
  <abbr title="greenhouse gas">
   GHG
  </abbr>
  Disclosure Standard, when market readiness is low or cannot be determined.
 </p>
<p>
  Option 2: Use this option for non-competitive requirements subject to the
  <abbr title="greenhouse gas">
   GHG
  </abbr>
  Disclosure Standard, and in contracts not subject to the
  <abbr title="greenhouse gas">
   GHG
  </abbr>
  Disclosure Standard where there is a requirement to include environmental considerations.
