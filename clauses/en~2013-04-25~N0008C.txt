<li value="1">This section applies despite any other provision of
the Contract and replaces the section of the general conditions
entitled "Liability". Any reference in this section to damages
caused by the Contractor also includes damages caused by its
employees, as well as its subcontractors, agents, and
representatives, and any of their employees. This section applies
regardless of whether the claim is based in contract, tort, or
another cause of action. The Contractor is not liable to Canada
with respect to the performance of or failure to perform the
Contract, except as described in this section and in any section of
the Contract pre-establishing any liquidated damages. The
Contractor is only liable for indirect, special or consequential
damages to the extent described in this section, even if it has
been made aware of the potential for those damages.</li>
<li value="2"><strong>Interruptions to Satellite Services</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Despite anything in the Contract to the contrary,
Canada agrees to indemnify the Contractor against all liability,
damages, or claims made against the Contractor by any third party
that relate to the Contractor's satellite service being interrupted
or unavailable, as long as the reason the Contractor's satellite
service was interrupted or unavailable was either:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">an event of force majeure, including, for example,
acts of God, meteors, fire, flood, weather conditions, Sun Transit
Period(s) (defined below), sun outages or other circumstances in
the space environment over which the Contractor has no control,
launch failure or other catastrophic failure of satellite, laws of
any governmental entity, acts of terrorism, insurrections,
embargoes, and wars; or</li>
<li value="2">a malfunction that occurs for any reason after the
satellite is launched, as long as the repairs cannot be made
remotely before the damage occurs, or the cost of making the
repairs is commercially unreasonable.</li></ol>
<p>This applies whether or not the event of force majeure or the
malfunction is foreseeable. Canada agrees that, in the event of
force majeure and/or malfunction as described above, Canada will
only be entitled to recover the service credits relating to
satellite service availability, if any, that are described in the
Contract.</p></li>
<li value="2">"<dfn>Sun Transit Period</dfn>" means the period when
the noise emissions from the sun degrade system performance at
earth stations below the specifications for the satellite services
to be provided by the Contractor under the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">Canada agrees that, if the satellite services being
provided by the Contractor under the Contract are interrupted or
unavailable for any reason not described in paragraph (a)(i) or
(ii), the amount that Canada can recover is subject to the limit
described in (3)(e) below or the service credits relating to
satellite service availability, if any, to which Canada is
entitled, whichever is more.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3"><strong>First Party Liability:</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">The Contractor is fully liable for all damages to
Canada, including indirect, special or consequential damages,
caused by the Contractor's performance or failure to perform the
Contract that relate to:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">any infringement of intellectual property rights to
the extent the Contractor breaches the section of the general
conditions entitled "Intellectual Property Infringement and
Royalties";</li>
<li value="2">physical injury, including death.</li></ol></li>
<li value="2">The Contractor is liable for all direct damages
affecting real or tangible personal property owned, possessed, or
occupied by Canada.</li>
<li value="3">Each of the Parties is liable for all direct damages
resulting from its breach of confidentiality under the Contract.
Each of the Parties is also liable for all indirect, special or
consequential damages in respect of its unauthorized disclosure of
the other Party's trade secrets (or trade secrets of a third party
provided by one Party to another under the Contract) relating to
information technology.</li>
<li value="4">The Contractor is liable for all direct damages
relating to any encumbrance or claim relating to any portion of the
Work for which Canada has made any payment. This does not apply to
encumbrances or claims relating to intellectual property rights,
which are addressed under (a) (i) above.</li>
<li value="5">The Contractor is also liable for any other direct
damages to Canada caused by the Contractor in any way relating to
the Contract, including:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">any breach of the warranty obligations under the
Contract, up to the total amount paid by Canada (including Applicable Taxes) for the goods and services affected by the breach
of warranty; and</li>
<li value="2"> any other direct damages, including all identifiable direct
costs to Canada associated with re-procuring the Work from another
party if the Contract is terminated either in whole or in part for
default, up to a total per Contract year for this subparagraph (ii)
of $ <var>____________</var>
(where each Contract year begins on the anniversary of the
Contract being issued). <span class="input-required"><kbd>(<em>Insert the amount from the appropriate commodity grouping.</em>)</kbd></span></li></ol></li>
<li value="6">If Canada's records or data are harmed as a result of
the Contractor's negligence or willful act, the Contractor's only
liability is, at the Contractor's own expense, to restore Canada's
records and data using the most recent back-up kept by Canada.
Canada is responsible for maintaining an adequate back-up of its
records and data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4"><strong>Third Party Claims</strong>:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Regardless of whether a third party makes its claim
against Canada or the Contractor, each Party agrees that it is
liable for any damages that it causes to any third party in
connection with the Contract as set out in a settlement agreement
or as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,
where the court determines that the Parties are jointly and
severally liable or that one Party is solely and directly liable to
the third party. The amount of the liability will be the amount set
out in the settlement agreement or determined by the court to have
been the Party's portion of the damages to the third party. No
settlement agreement is binding on a Party unless its authorized
representative has approved the agreement in writing.</li>
<li value="2">If Canada is required, as a result of joint and
several liability, to pay a third party in respect of damages
caused by the Contractor, the Contractor must reimburse Canada by
the amount finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be the Contractor's portion of the damages to the third party.
However, despite paragraph (a), with respect to special, indirect,
and consequential damages of third parties covered by this section,
the Contractor is only liable for reimbursing Canada for the
Contractor's portion of those damages that Canada is required by a
court to pay to a third party as a result of joint and several
liability that relate to the infringement of a third party's
intellectual property rights; physical injury of a third party,
including death; damages affecting a third party's real or tangible
personal property; liens or encumbrances on any portion of the
Work; or breach of confidentiality.</li>
<li value="3">The Parties are only liable to one another for
damages to third parties to the extent described in this paragraph
4.</li>
