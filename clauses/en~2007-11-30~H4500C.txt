       exists in respect to any materials, parts, work-in-process, or 
       finished work for which the Contractor intends to claim payment, the 
       Contractor agrees to inform the Contracting Authority without delay 
       and agrees, unless instructed otherwise by the Contracting Authority, 
       either:

       (a)    to cause the bank to remove such lien and to provide the 
              Contracting Authority with written confirmation from the bank; 
              or,

       (b)    to provide to the Contracting Authority an undertaking from 
              the bank that the bank will not make any claim under section 
              427 of the <em>Bank Act</em> on materials, parts, work-in-process, or 
              finished work in respect of which payment is made to the 
              Contractor under the Contract.

2.     Failure to inform the Contracting Authority of such lien or failure 
       to implement paragraph 1(a) or (b) above will constitute default 
       under the default section of the general conditions and will entitle 
       Canada to terminate the Contract.
