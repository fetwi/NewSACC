<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Payment by Canada for each delivery shall be made within:

       (a)    thirty (30) days following the date on which completed units 
              have been delivered at the location(s) specified in the 
              Contract and all other Work required to be performed by the 
              Contractor with respect to these units under the terms of the 
              Contract has been completed; or

       (b)    thirty (30) days following the date on which an invoice and 
              substantiating documentation are received according to the 
              terms of the Contract;

              whichever is later.

2.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the invoice or the 
   substantiating documentation, within fifteen (15) days of its receipt, 
   Canada shall notify the Contractor of the nature of the objection. "Form 
   of the invoice" means an invoice which contains or is accompanied by 
   such substantiating documentation as Canada requires. Failure by Canada 
   to act within fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified 
   in paragraph 1 of the clause to apply for the sole purpose of 
   calculating interest on overdue accounts.
