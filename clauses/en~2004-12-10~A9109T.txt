<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use this clause in all solicitation documents processed through the Automated 
Buyers Environment (ABE), since ABE contains an edit that prevents the release 
of a contract to a Canadian supplier that does not have a Procurement Business 
Number.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     For procurement purposes, Canada uses a unique Procurement Business 
       Number (PBN) to identify a supplier and its branches, divisions, or 
       offices, where appropriate.  The PBN is created using the entity's 
       Canada Revenue Agency Business Number.

2.     All Canadian suppliers are required to have a PBN prior to contract 
       award in order to receive a Public Works and Government Services 
       Canada (PWGSC) contract.  In exceptional circumstances, PWGSC may 
       decide to award, at its own discretion, a contract to a supplier 
       without a PBN.  Non-Canadian suppliers are strongly encouraged to 
       obtain a PBN.

3.     Suppliers may register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration 
       Information (SRI) service on line at the Contracts Canada Internet 
       site at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://contractscanada.gc.ca</strong>.  In order for suppliers to be 
       sourced by government buyers, they must complete the registration 
       process and activate their account in the SRI service.

4.     For non-Internet registration, contact the Contracts Canada InfoLine 
       at 1-800-811-1148 or (819) 956-3440, in the National Capital Area, 
       to obtain the telephone number of the nearest Supplier Registration 
       Agent.
