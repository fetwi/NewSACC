</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Prior to the purchasing of any spares estimated to be necessary for the 
performance of this Contract, a list of such spares shall be submitted to 
the Contracting Authority.  The Contracting Authority will forward the list 
of spares to the Technical Authority for review to determine if any 
existing stocks of spares belonging to Canada may be used as government 
issue in the performance of this Contract. When the list has been reviewed, 
the Contracting Authority shall advise the Contractor in writing of those 
spares, if any, which will be government issue under this Contract; 
provided that this clause shall not be construed as approval by Canada of 
the Contractor's estimates of the spares to be required in the performance 
of the Work; and provided further that this clause shall not be deemed to 
alter or modify any other provision of this Contract or relieve the 
Contractor from any responsibility in carrying out the Contract or impose 
any obligation on Canada.

The Contractor shall keep all such spares purchased or acquired by it, 
physically segregated from the Contractor-furnished material and shall 
furnish the Contracting Authority with an accounting of its acquisition, 
storage, handling and use of such spares as Canada may require.  The 
Contractor shall allow the Contracting and/or Technical Authority to have 
access to the Contractor's provisioning methods, allowing for the 
inspection of the inventories, accounting method, storage, handling, care, 
and the use of such spares.
