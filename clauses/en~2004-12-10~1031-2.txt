<strong>1031-2 01     (1992-04-01)  General Principle</strong>

The total cost of the Contract shall be the sum of the applicable direct 
and indirect costs which are, or are to be reasonably and properly incurred 
and/or allocated, in the performance of the Contract, less any applicable 
credits.  These costs shall be determined in accordance with the 
Contractor's cost accounting practices as accepted by the Crown and applied 
consistently over time.

<strong>1031-2 02     (1991-06-01)  Definition of a Reasonable Cost</strong>

1.     A cost is reasonable if, in nature and amount, it does not exceed 
       that which would be incurred by an ordinary prudent person in the 
       conduct of a competitive business.

2.     In determining the reasonableness of a particular cost, 
       consideration shall be given to:

       (a)    whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as normal 
              and necessary for the conduct of a contractor's business or 
              performance of the Contract;

       (b)    the restraints and requirements by such factors as generally 
              accepted sound business practices, arm's length  bargaining, 
              federal, provincial and local laws and regulations, and 
              Contract terms;

       (c)    the action that prudent business persons would take in the 
              circumstances, considering their responsibilities to the 
              owners of the business, their employees, customers, the 
              Government and public at large;

       (d)    significant deviations from the established practices of the 
              Contractor which may unjustifiably increase the Contract 
              costs; and

       (e)    the specifications, delivery schedule and quality 
              requirements of the particular contract as they affect costs.

<strong>1031-2 03     (2004-12-10)  Direct Costs</strong>

There are three categories of direct costs:

(a)    Direct Material Cost meaning the cost of materials which can be 
       specifically identified and measured as having been used or to be 
       used on the Contract and which are so identified and measured 
       consistently by the Contractor's cost accounting practices as 
       accepted by the Crown.

       (i)    These materials may include, in addition to materials 
              purchased solely for the Contract and processed by the 
              Contractor, or obtained from subcontractors, any other 
              materials issued from the Contractor's general stocks.

       (ii)   Materials purchased solely for the Contract or subcontracts 
              shall be charged to the Contract at the net laid-down cost to 
              the Contractor before cash discounts for prompt payment.

       (iii)  Materials issued from the Contractor's general stocks shall 
              be charged to the Contract in accordance with the method as 
              used consistently by the Contractor in pricing material 
              inventories.
 
(b)    Direct Labour Cost meaning that portion of gross wages or salaries 
       incurred for work which can be specifically identified and measured 
       as having been performed or to be performed on the Contract and 
       which is so identified and measured consistently by the Contractor's 
       cost accounting practices as accepted by the Crown.

(c)    Other Direct Costs meaning those applicable costs, not falling 
       within the categories of direct material or direct labour, but which 
       can be specifically identified and measured as having been incurred 
       or to be incurred in performance of the Contract and which are so 
       identified and measured consistently by the Contractor's costing 
       practices as accepted by the Crown. 

<strong>1031-2 04     (1991-06-01)  Indirect Costs</strong>

1      Indirect Costs (overhead) meaning those costs which, though 
       necessarily having been incurred during the period of the Contract 
       performance for the conduct of the Contractor's business in general, 
       cannot be identified and measured as directly applicable to 
       contracts.

2.     These Indirect Costs may include, but are not necessarily restricted 
       to, such items as:

       (a)    indirect materials and supplies(*);

       (b)    indirect labour;

       (c)    fringe benefits (the Contractor's contribution only);

       (d)    service expenses: expenses of a general nature such as power, 
              heat, light, operation and maintenance of general assets and 
              facilities;

       (e)    fixed/period charges: recurring charges such as property 
              taxes, rentals and reasonable provision for depreciation;

       (f)    general and administrative expenses: including remuneration 
              of executive and corporate officers, office wages and 
              salaries and expenses such as stationery, office supplies, 
              postage and other necessary administration and management 
              expenses;

       (g)    selling and marketing expenses associated with the products 
              or services being acquired under the Contract;

       (h)    general research and development expenses as considered 
              applicable by the Crown.  

(*)    For supplies of similar low-value, high-usage items the costs of 
       which meet the above definition of Direct Material Costs but for 
       which it is economically expensive to account for these costs in the 
       manner prescribed for direct costs, then they may be deemed to be 
       indirect costs for the Contract purposes. 

<strong>1031-2 05     (2004-12-10)  Allocation of Indirect Costs</strong>

Indirect costs shall be accumulated in appropriate indirect cost pools, 
reflecting a contractor's organizational or operational lines and these 
pools subsequently allocated to contracts in accordance with the following 
two principles:

(a)    the costs included in a particular indirect cost pool should have a 
       similarity of relationship with each contract to which that indirect 
       cost pool is subsequently distributed; further, the costs included 
       in an indirect cost pool should be similar enough in their 
       relationship to each other that the allocation of the total costs in 
       the pool provides a result which would be similar to that achieved 
       if each cost within that pool were separately distributed;

(b)    the allocation basis for each indirect cost pool should reflect, as 
       far as possible, the causal relationship of the pooled costs to the 
       contracts to which these costs are distributed. 

<strong>1031-2 6      (1991-06-01)  Credits</strong>

The applicable portion of any income, rebate, allowance, or any other 
credit relating to any applicable direct or indirect cost, received by or 
accruing to the Contractor, shall be credited to the Contract.

<strong>1031-2 07     (2004-12-10)  Non-applicable Costs</strong> 
Notwithstanding that the following costs may have been or may be reasonably 
and properly incurred by the Contractor during the performance of the 
Contract, they are considered non-applicable costs to the Contract:

(a)    allowance for interest on invested capital, bonds, debentures, bank 
       or other loans together with related bond discounts and finance 
       charges;

(b)    legal, accounting and consulting fees in connection with financial 
       reorganization, security issues, capital stock issues, obtaining of 
       patents and licenses and prosecution of claims against the Crown;

(c)    losses on investments, bad debts and expenses for the collection 
       thereof;

(d)    losses on other contracts;

(e)    federal and provincial income taxes, excess profit taxes or surtaxes 
       and/or special expenses in connection therewith;

       directors where proceeds accrue to the Contractor;

(h)    amortization of unrealized appreciation of assets;

(i)    depreciation of assets paid for by the Crown;

(j)    fines and penalties;

(k)    expenses and depreciation of excess facilities;

(l)    unreasonable compensation for officers and employees;

(m)    product development or improvement expenses not associated with the 
       product being acquired under the Contract;

(n)    advertising, except reasonable advertising of an industrial or 
       institutional character placed in trade, technical or professional 
       journals for the dissemination of information for the industry or 
       institution;

(o)    entertainment expenses;

(p)    donations except those to charities registered under the <em>Income Tax 
       Act</em>;

(q)    dues and other memberships other than regular trade and professional 
       associations;

(r)    fees, extraordinary or abnormal for professional advice in regard to 
       technical, administrative or accounting matters, unless approval 
       from the Contracting Authority is obtained.
