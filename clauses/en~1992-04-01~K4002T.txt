<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations to which the 
Canadian Content (Priority Groups) policy is applicable and in respect of which 
every bidder is being invited to include a certification of Canadian Content 
(that is, where the competition is being conditionally limited to bids 
qualifying for inclusion in Priority Group 1). See SPM Directive 3010.  
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>If this clause is signed and dated, the Bidder represents and warrants that, 
of the goods and/or services being offered to Canada, no less than 80 
percent of the bid price consists of goods and services of Canadian origin, 
and that the bid therefore qualifies for inclusion in Priority Group 1 as 
defined in DSS's Supply Policy Manual Directive 3010.

Bids that include this representation and warranty may be given preference 
over other bids, in accordance with the procedures set out in Directive 
3010.

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation 
and warranty to evaluate bids and may rely upon such representation and 
warranty to enter into any contract resulting from this bid. Such 
representation and warranty of Canadian Content may be verified in such 
manner as the Minister may reasonably require.

Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such covenant, 
the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting from this 
bid as being in default.
