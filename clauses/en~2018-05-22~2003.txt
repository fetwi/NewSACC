<ol>
<li>The <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em> (the “Policy”) in effect on the date the bid solicitation is issued, and all related Directives in effect on that date, are incorporated by reference into, and form a binding part of the bid solicitation. The Bidder must comply with the Policy and Directives, which can be found at <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em>. </li>
<li>Under the Policy, charges and convictions of certain offences against a Supplier, its affiliates or first tier subcontractors, and other circumstances, will or may result in a determination by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) that the Supplier is ineligible to enter, or is suspended from entering into a contract with Canada. The list of ineligible and suspended Suppliers is contained in
            <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Integrity Database. The Policy describes how enquiries can be made regarding the ineligibility or suspension of Suppliers.</li>
<li>In addition to all other information required in the bid solicitation, the Bidder must provide the following:
            <ol type="a">
<li>by the time stated in the Policy, all information required by the Policy described under the heading “Information to be Provided when Bidding, Contracting or Entering into a Real Property Agreement”; and</li>
<li>with its bid, a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy. The list of foreign criminal charges and convictions must be submitted using an Integrity Declaration Form, which can be found at Declaration form for procurement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Subject to subsection 5, by submitting a bid in response to this bid solicitation, the Bidder certifies that:

<li>it understands that certain domestic and foreign criminal charges and convictions, and other circumstances, as described in the Policy, will or may result in a determination of ineligibility or suspension under the Policy;</li>
<li>it is aware that Canada may request additional information, certifications, and validations from the Bidder or a third party for purposes of making a determination of ineligibility or suspension;</li>
<li>it has provided with its bid a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy;</li>

<li>it is not aware of a determination of ineligibility or suspension issued by
                    <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> that applies to it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Where a Bidder is unable to provide any of the certifications required by subsection 4, it must submit with its bid a completed Integrity Declaration Form, which can be found at Declaration form for procurement.</li>
<li>Canada will declare non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information requested is incomplete or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in a certification or declaration is found by Canada to be false or misleading in any respect. If Canada establishes after award of the Contract that the Bidder provided a false or misleading certification or declaration, Canada may terminate the Contract for default. Pursuant to the Policy, Canada may also determine the Bidder to be ineligible for award of a contract for providing a false or misleading certification or declaration.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Canada will make available Notices of Proposed Procurement (NPP), bid solicitations and related documents for download through the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). Canada is not responsible and will not assume any liabilities whatsoever for the information found on websites of third parties. In the event an NPP, bid solicitation or related documentation would be amended, Canada will not be sending notifications. Canada will post all amendments, including significant enquiries received and their replies, using
            <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>. It is the sole responsibility of the Bidder to regularly consult
            <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr> for the most up-to-date information. Canada will not be liable for any oversight on the Bidder's part nor for notification services offered by a third party.</li>
<li>Bids will remain open for acceptance for a period of not less than 60 days from the closing date of the bid solicitation, unless specified otherwise in the bid solicitation. Canada reserves the right to seek an extension of the bid validity period from all responsive bidders in writing, within a minimum of 3 days before the end of the bid validity period. If the extension is accepted by all responsive bidders, Canada will continue with the evaluation of the bids. If the extension is not accepted by all responsive bidders, Canada will, at its sole discretion, either continue with the evaluation of the bids of those who have accepted the extension or cancel the solicitation.</li>
<li>Bid documents and supporting information may be submitted in either English or French.</li>
<li>Bids received on or before the stipulated bid solicitation closing date and time will become the property of Canada and will not be returned. All bids will be treated as confidential, subject to the provisions of the
             Access to Information Act (
            <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr> 1985,
            <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> A-1) and the
             Privacy Act (

            <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> P-21).</li>
<li>Unless specified otherwise in the bid solicitation, Canada will evaluate only the documentation provided with a bidder's bid. Canada will not evaluate information such as references to Web site addresses where additional information can be found, or technical manuals or brochures not submitted with the bid.</li>
<li>A bid cannot be assigned or transferred in whole or in part.</li>

<p><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> will return or delete bids delivered after the stipulated solicitation closing date and time, unless they qualify as a delayed bid as described in section 07.</p>
<p>For late bids submitted using means other than the Canada Post Corporation's epost Connect service, the physical bid will be returned.</p>
<p>For bids submitted electronically, the late bids will be deleted. As an example, bids submitted using Canada Post Corporation's epost Connect service, conversations initiated by the Bid Receiving Unit via the epost Connect service pertaining to a late bid, will be deleted. Records will be kept documenting the transaction history of all late bids submitted using epost Connect. </p>

<ol>
<li>A bid delivered to the specified Bid Receiving Unit after the solicitation closing date and time but before the contract award date may be considered, provided the bidder can prove the delay is due solely to a delay in delivery that can be attributed to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a foreign country). Private courier (Purolator

            <ol type="a">
<li>the name of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li>the Procurement Business Number of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li>the name of the representative of the joint venture,
                    <abbr title="That is">i.e.</abbr> the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf, if applicable;</li>
<li>the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the information is not clearly provided in the bid, the Bidder must provide the information on request from the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li>The bid and any resulting contract must be signed by all the members of the joint venture unless one member has been appointed to act on behalf of all members of the joint venture. The Contracting Authority may, at any time, require each member of the joint venture to confirm that the representative has been appointed with full authority to act as its representative for the purposes of the bid solicitation and any resulting contract. If a contract is awarded to a joint venture, all members of the joint venture will be jointly and severally or solidarily liable for the performance of any resulting contract.</li>

<ol>
<li>In order to protect the integrity of the procurement process, bidders are advised that Canada may reject a bid in the following circumstances:
            <ol type="a">
<li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees was involved in any manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees had access to information related to the bid solicitation that was not available to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing or has provided the goods and services described in the bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li>Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2018-05-222003entire-requirement">19 (2007-11-30) Entire requirement</h2>
<p>The bid solicitation documents contain all the requirements relating to the bid solicitation. Any other information or documentation provided to or obtained by a bidder from any source are not relevant. Bidders should not assume that practices used under previous contracts will continue, unless they are described in the bid solicitation. Bidders should also not assume that their existing capabilities meet the requirements of the bid solicitation simply because they have met previous requirements.</p>
