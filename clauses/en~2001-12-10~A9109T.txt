<pre>1.     As a potential supplier to the Government of Canada an important 
       feature is the Procurement Business Number (PBN) created using the 
       Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Business Number to uniquely 
       identify a company and its branches, divisions, or offices, where 
       appropriate. 

2.     All Canadian companies are required to have a PBN prior to contract 
       award in order to receive a Public Works and Government Services 
       Canada (PWGSC) contract.  In exceptional circumstances, PWGSC may 
       decide to award, at its own discretion, a contract to a company 
       without a PBN.  Non-Canadian companies are strongly encouraged to 
       obtain a PBN.

3.     Companies may register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration 
       Information (SRI) Service on line at the Contracts Canada Internet 
       site at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline"><a href="http://contractscanada.gc.ca" rel="external">http://contractscanada.gc.ca</a>.</strong>  In order for companies to be 
       sourced by government buyers, they must complete the registration 
       process and activate their account in the SRI service.

4.     For non-Internet registration, please contact the Contracts Canada 
       InfoLine at 1-800-811-1148 or (819) 956-3440, in the National 
       Capital Area, to obtain the telephone number of the Supplier 
       Registration Agent nearest you.
