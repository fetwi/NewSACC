<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all "Limitation of Expenditure" and "Ceiling Price" 
contracts awarded to contractors other than Canadian universities, affiliated 
institutions, and colleges when the Contractor's time-keeping system, hours 
charged, direct expenses, and rate certification are subject to discretionary 
audit.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The following are subject to government audit before or after 
       payment is made:

       (a)    Amounts claimed under the terms and conditions of the 
              Contract, as computed in accordance with the Basis of Payment, 
              including time charged and salaries paid for labour charges 
              based on salaries times a firm negotiated multiplier.

       (b)    The accuracy of the Contractor's time recording system.

       (c)    The estimated amount of profit in any firm-priced element, 
              firm time rate, firm overhead rate, or firm salary multiplier, 
              for which the Contractor has provided the appropriate 
              certification. The purpose of such audit would be to 
              determine whether the actual profit earned on a single 
              contract if only one exists, or the aggregate of actual 
              profit earned by the Contractor on a series of negotiated 
              contracts containing one or more of the aforementioned prices, 
              time rates or multipliers, and received during a particular 
              period selected, is fair and reasonable based on the 
              estimated amount of profit included in earlier certification 
              (s).

       (d)    Any firm-priced element, firm time rate, firm overhead rate, 
              or firm salary multiplier for which the Contractor has 
              provided a "most favoured customer" certification.  The 
              purpose of such audit would be to determine whether the 
              Contractor has charged anyone else, including the Contractor'
              s most favoured customer, lower prices, rates or multipliers, 
              for like quality and quantity of goods or services.

2.     Any payments made pending completion of the audit shall be regarded 
       as interim payments only and shall be adjusted to the extent 
       necessary to reflect the results of the audit.  If there has been 
       any overpayment, it shall be refunded promptly to Canada.
