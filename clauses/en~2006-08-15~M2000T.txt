<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) 
       requires that some organizations bidding for federal government 
       contracts, valued at $200,000 or more (including all applicable 
       taxes), make a formal commitment to implement employment equity, as 
       a condition precedent to contract award.  If the Offeror is subject 
       to the Program, evidence of its commitment must be provided before 
       the issuance of a standing offer.

       Offerors that have been declared "Ineligible Contractors" by the 
       Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (HRSD) are no 
       longer eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold 
       for solicitation of bids as set out in the <em>Government Contracts 
       Regulations</em> (currently at $25,000, including all applicable taxes), 
       either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by the Department 
       of HRSD, or following their voluntary withdrawal from the Program 
       for a reason other than the reduction in their workforce.  Any offer 
       from ineligible offerors will not be considered for issuance of a 
       standing offer.

2.     The Offeror certifies its status with FCP-EE, as follows:

       The Offeror

       (a)    (    )        is not subject to FCP-EE, having a workforce of 
                            less than 100 permanent full or part-time 
                            employees in Canada,

       (b)    (    )        is not subject to FCP-EE, being a regulated 
                            employer under the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>;

       (c)    (    )        is subject to the requirements of FCP-EE, 
                            having a workforce of 100 or more permanent 
                            full or part-time employees in Canada, but has 
                            not previously obtained a certificate number 
                            from the Department of HRSD, (having not bid on 
                            requirements of $200,000 or more), in which 
                            case a duly signed certificate of commitment is 
                            provided herewith (attached);

       (d)    (    )        is subject to FCP-EE, and has a valid 
                            certification number as follows: _______ (e.g. 
                            has not been declared "Ineligible Contractor" 
                            by the Department of HRSD).

3.     If the Offeror does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 2. 
       (a) or (b), the Program requirements do apply, and as such, the 
       Offeror is required to submit to the Department of HRSD form LAB 
       1168, Certificate of Commitment to Implement Employment Equity, DULY 
       SIGNED or a valid Certificate number confirming its adherence to the 
       FCP-EE.

4.     The Offeror acknowledges that Canada will rely on this certification 
       to issue a standing offer .  Should a verification by Canada 
       disclose a misrepresentation on the part of the Offeror, the Canada 
       will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       standing offer as being in default, to terminate it pursuant to the 
       Default provisions of the Contract and set aside the Standing Offer.

5.     In all cases, the Offeror is required to produce evidence or 
       supporting information on demand before issuance of a standing offer, 
       if such evidence is not included with its offer.

       Signature of authorized representative:  _________________.
