<pre>1.     The attached Security Requirements Check List (SRCL) identifies the 
       security requirements for the destruction of PROTECTED information 
       at the PROTECTED A and B levels using approved shredding equipment 
       on the Contractor/Offeror's premises.

2.     The client department must ensure that only PROTECTED material no 
       higher than PROTECTED B level is provided to the Contractor/Offeror 
       for destruction under any resulting Contract/Standing Offer.

3.     The Contractor/Offeror must, at all times during the performance of 
       the Contract/Standing Offer, hold a valid Designated Organization 
       Screening with approved Document Safeguarding at the level of 
       PROTECTED B, issued or approved by the Canadian and International 
       Industrial Security Directorate (CIISD), Public Works and Government 
       Services Canada (PWGSC).

4.     The Contractor/Offeror personnel performing the shredding services 
       and/or requiring access to PROTECTED information, assets or 
       sensitive work site(s) must EACH hold a valid ENHANCED RELIABILITY 
       screening, granted or approved by CIISD/PWGSC.

5.     Should the Contractor/Offeror choose to utilize the services of 
       mentally challenged individuals, then ENHANCED RELIABILITY screening 
       will NOT be required; however, these individuals must be under the 
       constant supervision of an authorized company representative who 
       must hold the required level of ENHANCED RELIABILITY screening.

6.     Subcontracts which contain security requirements are NOT to be 
       awarded without the prior written permission of CIISD/PWGSC.

7.     The Contractor/Offeror must comply with the provisions of the:

       (a)    Security Requirements Check List, attached at Annex _____;
       (b)    <em>Industrial Security Manual</em> (June 1992).
