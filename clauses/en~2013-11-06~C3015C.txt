<li value="1">The foreign currency component (FCC) is defined as the portion of the price or rate that will be directly affected by exchange rate fluctuation.  The <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> should include all related taxes, duties and other costs paid by the Bidder and which are to be included in the adjustment amount.</li>
<li value="2">For each line item where a <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> is identified, Canada assumes the risks and benefits for exchange rate fluctuation, as shown in the Basis of Payment.  For such items, the exchange rate fluctuation amount is determined in accordance with the provision of this clause.</li>
<li value="3">The total price paid by Canada on each invoice will be adjusted at the time of payment, based on the <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> and the exchange rate fluctuation provisions in the contract.  The exchange rate adjustment amount will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
<br/>
<dfn>Adjustment</dfn> = FCC x  Qty  x  ( i<sub>1</sub> - i<sub>0</sub> ) / i<sub>0</sub>
<br/>where formula variables correspond to:
<dl>
<dt><strong>FCC</strong></dt>
<dd>Foreign Currency Component (per unit)</dd>
<dt><strong>i<sub>0</sub></strong></dt> <dd>Initial exchange rate (<abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per unit of foreign currency [e.g. <abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>1]) </dd>
<dt><strong>i<sub>1</sub></strong></dt><dd> exchange rate for adjustments (<abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per unit of foreign currency [e.g. <abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>1])</dd>
<dt><strong>Qty</strong></dt> <dd>quantity of units</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li value="4">The initial exchange rate is typically set as the noon rate as published by the Bank of Canada on the solicitation closing date.</li>
<li value="5">For goods, the exchange rate for adjustment will be the noon rate as published by the Bank of Canada on the date the goods were delivered.  For services, the exchange rate for adjustment will be the noon rate on the last business day of the month for which the services were performed.  For advance payments, the exchange rate for adjustment will be the noon rate on the date the payment was due.  The most recent noon rate will be used for non-business days.</li>
<li value="6">The Contractor must indicate the total exchange rate adjustment amount (either upward, downward or no change) as a separate item on each invoice or claim for payment submitted under the Contract.  Where an adjustment applies, the Contractor must submit with their invoice form <a class="gov" href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/forms/formulaires-forms-eng.html#f450" rel="external">PWGSC-TPSGC 450<img alt="The information is only accessible to federal government department and agency employees." class="gov-publiserve-icon" height="16" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA0AAAANCAQAAADY4iz3AAAAEUlEQVR42mNkwAkYR6UolgIACvgADsuK6xYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" width="20"/></a>, Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments.</li>
<li value="7">The exchange rate adjustment will only be applied where the exchange rate fluctuation is greater than 2% (increase or decrease), calculated in accordance with column 8 of form <a class="gov" href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/forms/formulaires-forms-eng.html#f450" rel="external">PWGSC-TPSGC 450<img alt="The information is only accessible to federal government department and agency employees." class="gov-publiserve-icon" height="16" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA0AAAANCAQAAADY4iz3AAAAEUlEQVR42mNkwAkYR6UolgIACvgADsuK6xYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" width="20"/></a> (i.e [ i<sub>1</sub> - i<sub>0</sub> ) / i<sub>0</sub>]).</li>
<li value="8">Canada reserves the right to audit any revision to costs and prices under this clause.</li>
