<h2 id="2015-07-032006general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The process normally starts with a Request for Standing Offers
(RFSO) that suppliers may obtain through the Government Electronic
Tendering Service (GETS). A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> is an invitation to suppliers to
provide <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with a standing offer. The quantity of goods, level
of services and estimated expenditure specified in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> are
only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing
offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A
standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a
Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to
departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not
constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods,
services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or
several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>

In addition, Offerors must respond to Requests for Standing Offers (RFSO) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, and that accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the RFSO, Standing Offer (SO) and any resulting contracts, and submit offers as well as enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.</li>
<li>By submitting an offer, Offerors confirm that they understand that being convicted of certain offences will render them ineligible to be issued a standing offer or to be awarded a contract.

<li>
Period of Ineligibility for Providing False or Misleading Information<br/>
The Offeror confirms that it understands that where it has made a false declaration or provided false or misleading information under these Integrity Provisions, the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr> will declare an Offeror to be ineligible to be issued a standing offer or be awarded a contract for a period of ten years.

The period of suspension is effective from the date of determination by the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr>. A period of suspension does suspend all other periods of ineligibility that may be imposed on an Offeror by the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr>.</li>
<li>
Third Party Validation<br/>
The Offeror confirms that it understands that where it or any of the Offeror's Affiliates has been subject to a period of ineligibility to be issued a standing offer or to be awarded a contract, for which the Canadian Pardons and the Foreign Pardons subsections do not apply, the Offeror must provide by the Request for Standing Offers (RFSO) closing date, a confirmation from an independent third party, recognized in advance by the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr>, confirming that measures have been put in place in order to avoid the reoccurrence of such wrongdoings that led to the convictions.

<li>
Public Interest Exception<br/>

</li>
<li>Canada may only issue a standing offer with an Offeror under this subsection where the ineligible Offeror has concluded an Administrative Agreement with the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr>, on such terms and conditions that are necessary to safeguard the integrity of the procurement process and can apply to any procurement.

has been appointed with full authority to act as its representative
for the purposes of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any resulting standing offer. If a

for the performance of any contract resulting from a call-up
against the standing offer.</li>

their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> or in any situation of

<li value="2">if the Offeror, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> that was not available to other
offerors and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to
give the Offeror an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by an offeror who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This offeror remains however subject to the
criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject an offer under this
section, the Standing Offer Authority will inform the Offeror and
provide the Offeror an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Offerors who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Standing Offer Authority
before the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> closing. By submitting an offer, the Offeror
represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of
interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Offeror acknowledges
that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a
conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict
of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>

also not assume that their existing capabilities meet the
requirements of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> simply because they have met previous
requirements.</p>
