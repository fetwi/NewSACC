accordance with the Basis of Payment, including time charged.</li>
<li value="2">The accuracy of the Contractor's time recording
system.</li>
<li value="3">The estimated amount of profit in any firm-priced
element, firm time rate, firm overhead rate, or firm salary
multiplier, for which the Contractor has provided the appropriate
certification. The purpose of the audit is to determine whether the
actual profit earned on a single contract if only one exists, or
the aggregate of actual profit earned by the Contractor on a series
of negotiated contracts containing one or more of the prices, time
rates or multipliers mentioned above, during a particular period
selected, is reasonable and justifiable based on the estimated
amount of profit included in earlier price or rate
certification(s).</li>
<li value="4">Any firm-priced element, firm time rate, firm
overhead rate, or firm salary multiplier for which the Contractor
has provided a "most favoured customer" certification. The purpose
of such audit is to determine whether the Contractor has charged
anyone else, including the Contractor's most favoured customer,
lower prices, rates or multipliers, for like quality and quantity
of goods or services.</li>
