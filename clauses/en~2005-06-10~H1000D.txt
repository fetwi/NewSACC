<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Payment by Canada to the Contractor for the Work shall be made 
       within:

       (a)    thirty (30) days following the date on which all of the Work 
              has been delivered at the delivery point specified in the 
              Contract, not the ultimate destination, and all other Work 
              required to be performed by the Contractor under the terms of 
              the Contract has been completed; or 

       (b)    thirty (30) days following the date on which an invoice and 
              substantiating documentation are received according to the 
              terms of the Contract;

       whichever date is the later.

2.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the invoice or the 
       substantiating documentation, within fifteen (15) days of its 
       receipt, Canada shall notify the Contractor of the nature of the 
       objection. "Form of the invoice" means an invoice which contains or 
       is accompanied by such substantiating documentation as Canada 
       requires.  Failure by Canada to act within fifteen (15) days will 
       only result in the date specified in subsection 1 of the clause to 
       apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest on overdue 
       accounts.
