<strong>05Acceptance of Tender</strong>

1.     Her Majesty may accept any tender, whether it is the lowest or not, 
       or may reject any and all tenders.

2.     Without limiting the generality of Clause 5.1, Her Majesty may 
       reject any tender, based on unfavourable assessment as to;

(a)    the adequacy of the tendered price to carry out the work and, in the 
              case of a tender providing unit prices, whether the unit 
              prices reasonably reflect the cost of performing the work 
              related to those prices;
(b)    whether the Tenderer has the necessary management structure, skilled 
              personnel, experience and equipment to perform competently 
              the work under the contract; and

(c)    the Tenderer's performance on other contracts.
 
3.     In assessing the Tenderer's performance on other contracts pursuant 
       to clause 5.2.3, Her Majesty may consider, but not be limited to, 
       such matters as;

(a)    the efficiency and workmanship of the Tenderer in performing the 
              work; and

(b)    the extent to which the Tenderer executed the work in accordance 
              with terms and conditions of the contract.

4.     Her Majesty may reject a bid where any of the following 
       circumstances is present:

(a)    the Tenderer, or any employee or subcontractor included as part of 
              the Tender, has been convicted under section 121 ("<em>Frauds on 
              the government</em>" and "<em>Contractor subscribing to election fund</em>"), 
              124 ("<em>Selling or purchasing office</em>") or 418 ("<em>Selling 
              defective stores to Her Majesty</em>") of the <em>Criminal Code</em>; or

(b)    the Tenderer's bidding privileges are suspended or are in the 
              process of being suspended;

(c)    the bidding privileges of an employee or subcontractor included as 
              part of the Tender have been suspended or are in the process 
              of being suspended, which suspension or pending suspension 
              would render that employee or subcontractor ineligible to bid 
              on the Work, or the portion of the Work the employee or 
              subcontractor is to perform;

(d)    with respect to current or prior transaction with the Government of 
              Canada;

(1)    the Tenderer is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its 
                     activities are rendered inoperable for an extended 
                     period;

(2)    evidence, satisfactory to Her Majesty, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent 
                     misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law 
                     protecting individuals against any manner of 
                     discrimination, has been received with respect to the 
                     Tenderer, any of its employees or any subcontractor 
                     included as part of its Tender;

(3)    the Minister has previously exercised or intends to exercise the 
                     contractual remedy of taking the work out of the 
                     contractor's hands with respect to a Contract with the 
                     Tenderer, any of its employees or any subcontractor 
                     included as part of its Tender; or

(4)    Her Majesty determines that the Tenderer's performance on other 
                     contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as 
                     well as the extent to which the Tenderer executed the 
                     work in accordance with contractual terms and 
                     conditions, is sufficiently poor to jeopardize the 
                     successful completion of the requirement being bid on.

5.     Where Her Majesty intends to reject a Tender pursuant to a provision 
       of clause 5.4, other than subclause 5.4.2, the Minister will so 
       inform the Tenderer and provide the Tenderer then (10 days within 
       which to make representations prior to making a final decision on 
       the Tender rejection.
