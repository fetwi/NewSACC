proposed in its offer will be available to perform the Work
resulting from a call-up against the Standing Offer as required by
Canada's representatives and at the time specified in a call-up or
agreed to with Canada's representatives. If for reasons beyond its

individual named in its offer, the Offeror may propose a substitute
with similar qualifications and experience. The Offeror must advise
the Standing Offer Authority of the reason for the substitution and
provide the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed
replacement. For the purposes of this clause, only the following
reasons will be considered as beyond the control of the Offeror:
death, sickness, maternity and parental leave, retirement,
resignation, dismissal for cause or termination of an agreement for
default.</p>
<p>If the Offeror has proposed any individual who is not an
employee of the Offeror, the Offeror certifies that it has the
permission from that individual to propose his/her services in
relation to the Work to be performed and to submit his/her
résumé to Canada. The Offeror must, upon request from the
Standing Offer Authority, provide a written confirmation, signed by
the individual, of the permission given to the Offeror and of
his/her availability. Failure to comply with the request may result
in the offer being declared non-responsive.</p>
