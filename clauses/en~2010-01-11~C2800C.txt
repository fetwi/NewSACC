<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in Canadian defence contracts awarded to United States 
(U.S.) contractors, for the provision of goods to be used directly in Canadian 
defence activities.  This will indicate to the U.S. contractors that a defence 
priority rating will be assigned and communicated to them shortly.

NOTE:

1.	A threshold of US$50,000 is included in the U.S. Defense Priorities and 
Allocations System regulation (15 CFR Part 700.17) where it is stated that for 
contracts under this value, a priority rating is not required "provided that 
delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of a priority 
rating."

2.	The Tender Contract Distribution Unit will forward a copy of the Department 
of National Defence contracts, which have been awarded to U.S. contractors, to 
the Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer (DPAO), Public Works and 
Government Services Canada.  If the contracting officer wishes to provide a copy 
of the contract directly to the DPAO, it can be done by sending a PDF version of 
the contract by e-mail to: ACQB Defence Priorities.

For more information on the application of a priority rating, consult 3.35.25.5 
of the Supply Manual.</pre>
