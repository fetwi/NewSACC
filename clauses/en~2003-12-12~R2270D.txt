1.     By giving notice in writing to the Contractor, the Minister may take 
       all or any part of the Work out of the Contractor's hands, and may 
       employ such means as the Minister sees fit to have the Work 
       completed if the Contractor

       (a)    fails to remedy any delay in the commencement or default in 
              the execution of the Work to the satisfaction of the 
              Departmental Representative within six (6) days of the 
              Minister giving written notice to the Contractor to do so;

       (b)    defaults in the completion of any part of the Work within the 
              time fixed by the Contract for its completion;

       (c)    becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy and has 
              neither made a proposal to its creditors nor filed a notice 
              of intention to make such a proposal pursuant to the <em>
              Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>;

       (d)    abandons the Work;

       (e)    makes an assignment contrary to GC1.3; and or

       (f)    otherwise fails to observe or perform any of the provisions 
of the Contract.

2.     If the whole or any part of the Work is taken out of the Contractor'
       s hands, the Contractor's right to any further payment that is due 
       or accruing due under the Contract is extinguished.

3.     The Contractor shall be liable to pay Canada, upon demand, an amount 
       that is equal to the sum of all losses and damages incurred or 
       sustained by Canada in respect of the Contractor's failure to 
       complete the Work.

4.     If the whole or any part of the Work that is taken out of the 
       Contractor's hands pursuant to subsection 1 of GC7.1 is completed by 
       Canada, the Departmental Representative shall calculate the amount, 
       if any, of the holdback or progress claims that had accrued and was 
       due prior to the date on which the Work was taken out of the 
       Contractor's hands.

5.     If it is determined that there is an amount that is not required for 
       the purposes of having the Work performed or of compensating Canada 
       for any other loss or damage incurred or sustained by reason of the 
       Contractor's default, Canada may then pay the Contractor the amount 
       determined not to be required pursuant to subsection 4 of GC7.1.

<strong>GC7.2  Effect of Taking the Work Out of the Contractor's Hands</strong>

1.     The taking of the Work or part thereof out of the Contractor's hands 
       pursuant to subsection 1 of GC7.1 does not operate so as to relieve 
       or discharge the Contractor from any obligations under the Contract 
       or imposed upon the Contractor by law except the obligation to 
       complete the performance of that part of the Work that was taken out 
       of the Contractor's hands.

2.     All Plant and Material and the interest of the Contractor in all 
       real property, licenses, powers and privileges acquired, used, 
       provided or consumed by the Contractor under the Contract shall 
       continue to be the property of Canada without compensation to the 
       Contractor.

3.     When the Departmental Representative certifies that any Plant, 
       Material or any interest of the Contractor referred to in GC7.2, is 
       no longer required for the purpose of the Work, or that it is not in 
       the interests of Canada to retain that Plant, Material or interest, 
       it shall revert to the Contractor. 
<strong>GC7.3  Suspension of the Contract</strong>

1.     The Minister may, upon giving notice in writing to the Contractor, 
       suspend the performance of the Work at any time.  The Contractor 
       shall comply with such notice immediately, subject to any conditions 
       that may be stipulated in the notice.

2.     If the Minister suspends the Work for thirty (30) days or less the 
       Contractor shall, subject to its remedy under GC5.9, complete the 
       Work when called upon to do so.  If the Minister suspends the Work 
       for a period in excess of thirty (30) days, the Contractor may 
       request that the Minister terminate the Contract pursuant to GC7.4.

3.     It is the responsibility of the Contractor to  mitigate all costs 
       during the suspension period.

<strong>GC7.4  Termination of the Contract</strong>

1.     The Minister may terminate the Contract at any time by giving notice 
       of termination in writing to the Contractor and upon receipt of such 
       notice the Contractor shall cease all operations in performance of 
       the Contract, subject to any conditions that may be stipulated in 
       the notice.

2.     Termination under subsection 1 of GC7.4 shall not relieve the 
       Contractor of any legal or contractual obligations other than that 
       portion of Work that remains to be completed at the time of the 
       termination.

3.     Payment, in event of termination under this subsection, shall be 
       made pursuant to the provision of GC5.8.
