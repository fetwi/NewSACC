<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Compliance with the certifications the Bidder provides to Canada is subject 
   to verification by Canada during the bid evaluation period (before award 
   of a contract) and after contract award.  The Contracting Authority will 
   have the right to ask for additional information to verify the Bidder's 
   compliance with the  certifications before award of a contract.  The Bid 
   will be declared non-responsive if it is determined that any 
   certification made by the Bidder is untrue, whether made knowingly or 
   unknowingly.  Any failure to comply with the certifications or to comply 
   with the request of the Contracting Authority for additional information 
   will also render the bid non-responsive.
