<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Section 04 of DSS-MAS 9601-7, "Canada to Own Intellectual Property 
       Rights in Foreground Information", is deleted and replaced by the 
       following:

       <strong>04     License to Intellectual Property Rights in Background 
              Information</strong>

       1.     Without restricting the scope of any license or other right 
              in the Background Information that Canada may otherwise hold, 
              the Contractor hereby grants to Canada a non-exclusive, 
              perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, fully-paid and 
              royalty-free license to exercise such of the Intellectual 
              Property Rights in any Background Information incorporated 
              into the Work or necessary for the performance of the Work as 
              may be required in order for Canada to exercise its 
              Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground Information.  
              The Contractor agrees to make any such Background Information 
              (including, in the case of Software, source code) promptly 
              available to Canada for any such purpose.

       2.     The Contractor acknowledges that Canada may wish to award 
              contracts for any of the purposes contemplated in subsection 
              1 and that such contract awards may follow a competitive 
              process.  The Contractor agrees that Canada's license in 
              relation to the Intellectual Property Rights in the 
              Background Information includes the right to disclose the 
              Background Information to bidders for such contracts and to 
              sub-license or otherwise authorize the use of that 
              information by any contractor engaged by Canada solely for 
              the purpose of carrying out such a contract.  Canada shall 
              require bidders and the contractor not to use or disclose any 
              Background Information except as may be necessary to bid for 
              or to carry out that contract.

       3.     Where the Intellectual Property Rights in any Background 
              Information are owned by a Subcontractor at any tier, the 
              Contractor shall either obtain a license from that 
              Subcontractor that permits compliance with subsections 1 and 
              2 or arrange for the Subcontractor to convey directly to 
              Canada the same rights by execution of the form provided for 
              that purpose by the Minister, in which case the Contractor 
              shall deliver that form to the Minister, duly completed and 
              executed by the Subcontractor, no later than the time of 
              disclosure to Canada of that Background Information.

       4.     Notwithstanding subsection 1, the license set out therein 
              shall not apply to any Software that is subject to detailed 
              license conditions that are set out elsewhere in the Contract.
