</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>In the performance of the Work described herein, the Contractor shall 
conform to the requirements of:

       ISO/IEC 17025:1999 General requirements for the competence of 
       testing and calibration laboratories.

It is not the intent of this clause to require that the Contractor be 
registered to the applicable standard; however, the Contractor's quality 
management system must address each requirement contained in the standard.

Assistance for Government Quality Assurance (GQA):

The Contractor shall provide the Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) 
with the accommodation and facilities required for the proper 
accomplishment of GQA and shall provide any assistance required by the QAR 
for evaluation, verification, validation, documentation or release of 
product.

The QAR shall have the right of access to any area of the Contractor's or 
Subcontractor's facilities where any part of the Work is being performed.  
The QAR shall be afforded unrestricted opportunity to evaluate and verify 
Contractor conformity with Quality System procedures and to validate 
product conformity with contract requirements.  The Contractor shall make 
available for reasonable use by the QAR the equipment necessary for all 
validation purposes.  Contractor personnel shall be made available for 
operation of such equipment as required.

When the QAR determines that GQA is required at a Subcontractor's 
facilities, the Contractor shall provide for this in the purchasing 
document and forward copies to the QAR, together with relevant technical 
data as the QAR may request.

The Contractor shall notify the QAR of non-conforming product received from 
a Subcontractor when the product has been subject to GQA.
