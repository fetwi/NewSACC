<strong>06/91</strong>

Every right or power of the Minister under the Contract or otherwise shall 
be cumulative and non-exclusive.  

<strong>9224   03     Status of the Contractor</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

This is a contract for research and development and related scientific 
activities and for the performance of the Work. The Contractor is engaged 
as an independent contractor for the sole purpose of performing the Work. 
Neither the Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee, 
servant or agent of Her Majesty. The Contractor agrees to be solely

Insurance, Workmen's Compensation, or Income Tax. 

<strong>9224   04     Entire Agreement</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

The Contract constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with 
respect to the subject matter of the Contract and supersedes all previous 
negotiations, communications and other agreements, whether written or oral,

There are no terms, obligations, covenants, representations, statements or 
conditions other than those contained herein. 

<strong>9224   05     Replacement of Personnel</strong>

Contract to perform the Work, unless the Contractor is unable to do so for 
reasons which are beyond its control.  

(2) Should the Contractor at any time be unable to provide their services, 
it shall be responsible for providing replacement persons who shall be of 
similar ability and attainment and who shall be acceptable to both the 
Scientific Authority and Science Procurement Officer. At least thirty (30) 
days, where possible, in advance of the date upon which replacement persons 
are to commence work, the Contractor shall notify in writing both the 
Scientific Authority and the Science Procurement Officer of:       

       (a) the reason for the removal of the named personnel from the Work;

       (b) the names of the proposed replacement persons; and       
 
       (c) the qualifications and experience of the proposed replacement 
       persons.  

(3) In no event shall the Contractor allow performance of the Work by 
unauthorized replacement persons.  

(4) Acceptance of a replacement person by the Scientific Authority and the 
Science Procurement Officer shall not relieve the Contractor from 
responsibility for failure to meet the requirements of the Contract. 

<strong>9224   06     Access to Work</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) The Minister and the Scientific Authority shall have access at all 
reasonable times to the Work and to the premises where any part of the Work 
is being performed, and may make such examinations and tests of the Work as 
the Minister or Scientific Authority may think fit. The Contractor shall 
provide all assistance which the Minister or the Scientific Authority may 
reasonably require for the performance of such examinations or tests of the 
Work.  

(2) The Contractor shall notify the Science Procurement Officer and the 
Scientific Authority prior to the occurrence of any critical test, trials 
or examinations of the Work required under the Contract, as to the specific 
time and location of such test, trial or examination.

<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) All the Deliverables furnished or rendered under the Contract shall be 
subject to inspection by the Scientific Authority prior to acceptance.

the requirements of the Contract, the Scientific Authority shall have the 
right to reject it or require its correction. 

(3) The Contractor shall adhere to the Scientific Authority's reasonable 
interpretation of the Work statement set out in the Contract.  

(4) Inspection or acceptance shall not relieve the Contractor from 
responsibility for failure to meet the requirements of the Contract. 

<strong>9224   08     Warranty by Contractor</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) The Contractor warrants that it is competent to perform the Work and 
that it has the necessary qualifications including knowledge and skill with 
the ability to use them effectively in performing the Work.

diligent and efficient manner and to provide a quality of service at least 
equal to that which contractors generally would expect of a like contractor 
in a like situation.  

(3) Notwithstanding acceptance of the Deliverables or any part thereof, the 
Contractor further warrants that the Deliverables shall be of such quality 
as to clearly demonstrate that the Contractor has performed the Work in 
accordance with the above undertaking.  

(4) Notwithstanding prior acceptance of any Prototypes, and without 
restricting any other term of the Contract or any condition, warranty or 
provision implied or imposed by law, the Contractor, if requested by the 
Minister to do so at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of 
delivery, shall redo, correct or make good, at its own expense, any 
Prototype, excluding Crown Property furnished by Her Majesty incorporated 
therein, which fails to conform to the requirements of the Contract and 
deliver such Prototype which has been redone, corrected or made good to the 
Scientific Authority provided that where, in the opinion of the Minister, 
it is not expedient to remove a Prototype which does not conform to the 
requirements of the Contract from its location, the Contractor shall make 
good the Prototype at such location, and shall be paid the actual Costs 
incurred in so doing (including reasonable travelling and living expenses) 
with no allowance thereon by way of overhead or profit, less a sum 
equivalent to the Cost of making good the Prototype had it been made good 
at the Contractor's plant.  

(5) In the event that a warranty of a supplier to the Contractor is for a 
time period less than the time period stated in subsection (4) above, then, 
unless the Contractor advised the Science Procurement Officer and the 
Scientific Authority in writing prior to acceptance, the above warranty 
period shall apply.

Work.

       are properly identified and timely disclosed to Her Majesty; and     

       (b) forward immediately and without delay, in writing, all

<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) Time is of the essence of the Contract.  

(2) Any delay by the Contractor in performing its obligations under the 
Contract which is caused by an event beyond the control of the Contractor, 
and which could not have been circumvented by the Contractor without 
incurring unreasonable cost, through the use of alternative sources, 
work-around plans, or other means, constitutes an excusable delay. Events 
may include but are not restricted to acts of God, acts of Her Majesty, 
acts of local or provincial governments, fires, floods, epidemics, 
quarantine restrictions, strikes or labour unrest, freight embargoes and 
unusually severe weather.  

(3) The time for completing the Work which has been or is likely to be 
delayed by reason of an excusable delay shall be extended by a period equal 
to the length of the excusable delay, provided that the Contractor shall 
give notice, in writing, of any excusable delay to the Minister within two 
(2) weeks of the start of the excusable delay. The notice shall contain a 
description of the delay and of the portion of the Work affected by the 
delay.  

(4) Within two (2) weeks from the date of the giving of notice of excusable 
delay, the Contractor shall deliver a description, in writing, of its 
work-around plans including alternative sources and any other means that it 
will utilize to overcome the delay and endeavour to prevent any further 
delay. The description shall be in form, substance and detail satisfactory 
to the Minister.  

(5) If the Contractor should not give the notice of excusable delay, or 
should not deliver its work-around plans in accordance with the times 
stipulated in this section, any delay shall not constitute an excusable 
delay.  

(6) The Contractor shall implement such work-around plans only where the 
plans will not cause any additional Cost to Her Majesty. In the event the 
implementation of such work-around plans will cause additional Cost to Her 
Majesty, it may be authorized by a change to the Contract. 

<strong>9224   19     Patent, Industrial Design and Copyright</strong>
<strong>06/91  Claims</strong>

(1) The Contractor shall indemnify Her Majesty against all costs, charges 
and expenses whatsoever, including legal costs or fees, that Her Majesty 
sustains or incurs in or about all claims, actions, suits and proceedings 
for the infringement or alleged infringement of any patent, registered 
industrial design or copyright based upon the use of any Invention in 
connection with the performance of its obligations under the Contract or 
for the use of or disposal by Her Majesty of anything furnished pursuant to 
the Contract.  

(2) Upon notice in writing from the Minister that any such claim, action, 
suit or proceeding has been made, the Contractor shall, at its own expense, 
provide the necessary assistance to Her Majesty to settle or litigate the 
same.

proceedings for the payment of royalties in respect of any model, plan, 
design or specification supplied by or on behalf of Her Majesty to the 
Contractor, but this indemnity shall apply only to the Contract.

Contractor or any of its Subcontractors will or may be obligated to pay or 
proposes to pay for or in respect of the carrying out of the Contract, and 
the basis thereof, and the parties to whom the same are payable, and shall 
promptly advise the Minister of any and all claims or arrangements made or 
proposed which would or might result in further or different payments by 
way of royalties being made by the Contractor or any of its Subcontractors.  

(5) If and to the extent that the Minister so directs, the Contractor shall 
not pay, and shall direct its Subcontractors not to pay any royalties in 
respect of the carrying out of the Contract.  

(6) From and after the giving of any such direction, and subject to 
compliance by the Contractor with the foregoing provisions, Her Majesty 
shall relieve and indemnify the Contractor from and against all claims, 
actions or proceedings for payment of such royalties as are covered by such 
direction.  

(7) The Contract Price shall be reduced by the amount of the royalties 
included therein to which the indemnity provided in paragraph (6) above 
applies.

Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall 
indemnify and save harmless Her Majesty and the Minister from and against 
any and all claims, damages, loss, costs and expenses which they or either 
of them may at any time incur or suffer as a result of or arising out of,       

       (a) any injury to persons (including injuries resulting in death) or 
       loss of or damage to property of others which may be or be alleged 
       to be caused by or suffered as a result of the performance of the 
       Work or any part thereof, except to the extent caused by or due to 
       Her Majesty; and        
       (b) any liens, attachments, charges or other encumbrances or claims 
       upon or in respect of any materials, work in process or finished 
       Deliverables furnished to, or in respect of which any payment has 
       been made by, Her Majesty. 

<strong>9224   21     Termination, Suspension, Change</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) The Minister may, by giving notice to the Contractor, terminate or 
suspend the Contract as regards all or any part of the Work, or change the 
scope of the Work or any portion of the Work. The Contractor shall 
immediately comply with the requirements of any such notice and, in so 
doing, take every reasonable action that will minimize the Cost of 
performing the Contract and complying with the notice.  

(2) When, as a result of a notice mentioned in subsection (1):      

       (a) any suspension or change in the scope of the Work results in an 
       increase or decrease in the Cost directly related to the performance 
       of the Contract, the Price of the Contract shall be adjusted by the 
       amount of such increase or decrease in Cost; or       

       (b) the Work or any portion of the Work is terminated, the 
       Contractor shall be paid for all finished Deliverables delivered and 
       accepted, and for all materials or work in process delivered and 
       acceptable to Her Majesty, such actual Costs to the Contractor which 
       the Minister considers reasonable in terms of the Contract, plus the 
       proportional part of any fee applicable thereto, and any other Cost 
       directly and necessarily incurred as a result of the termination; 
       but in no event shall the aggregate of the price paid to date and 
       any amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph exceed the total 
       Contract Price. 

<strong>9224   22     Default</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) The Minister may, by written notice of default given to the Contractor, 
terminate the whole or any part of the Contract if, 

       (a) the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or has a receiving 
       order made against it, or makes an assignment for the benefit of 
       creditors, or if an order is made or resolution passed for the
