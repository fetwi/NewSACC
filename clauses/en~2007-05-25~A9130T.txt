<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     As the resulting Contract will require the production of or access 
       to controlled goods that are subject to the <em>Defence Production Act</em>, 
       R.S. 1985, c.D-1, bidders are advised that within Canada only 
       persons who are registered, exempt or excluded under the Controlled 
       Goods Program (CGP) are lawfully entitled to examine, possess or 
       transfer controlled goods.  Details on how to register under the GCP 
       are available at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://www.cgp.gc.ca</strong>, and registration is carried 
       out as follows:

       (a)    When the bid solicitation includes controlled goods 
              information or technology, the Bidder must be registered, 
              exempt or excluded under the CGP before receiving the bid 
              solicitation.  Requests for technical data packages or 
              specifications related to controlled goods should be made in 
              writing to the Contracting Authority identified in the bid 
              solicitation and must contain the CGP registration number or 
              written proof of exemption or exclusion of the Bidder and of 
              any other person to whom the Bidder will give access to the 
              controlled goods.

       (b)    When the bid solicitation does not include controlled goods 
              information or technology but the resulting Contract requires 
              the production of or access to controlled goods, the 
              successful Bidder and any subcontractor who will be producing 
              or accessing controlled goods must be registered, exempt or 
              excluded under the CGP before examining, possessing or 
              transferring controlled goods.

       (c)    When the successful Bidder and any subcontractor proposed to 
              examine, possess or transfer controlled goods are not 
              registered, exempt or excluded under the CGP at time of 
              contract award, the successful Bidder and any subcontractor 
              must, within seven (7) working days from receipt of written 
              notification of contract award, ensure that the required 
              application(s) for registration or exemption are submitted to 
              the CGP.  No examination, possession or transfer of 
              controlled goods must be performed until the successful 
              Bidder has provided proof, satisfactory to the Contracting 
              Authority, that the successful Bidder and any subcontractor 
              are registered, exempt, or excluded under the CGP.

       Failure to provide proof, satisfactory to the Contracting Authority, 
       that the successful Bidder and any subcontractor are registered, 
       exempt or excluded under the CGP, within thirty (30) days from 
       receipt of written notification of contract award, will be 
       considered a default under the resulting Contract except to the 
       extent that Canada is responsible for the failure due to delay in 
       processing the application.

2.     Bidders are advised that all information on the Application for 
       Registration (or exemption) Form will be verified and errors or 
       inaccuracies may cause significant delays and/or result in denial of 
       registration or exemption.
