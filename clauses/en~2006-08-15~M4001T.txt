<pre>1.     This procurement is limited to Canadian goods and/or services as 
       defined in clause K4000D.

2.     The Offeror represents and warrants that, of the goods and services 
       being offered, no less than 80 percent of the offer price consists 
       of Canadian goods and/or services as defined in clause K4000D.

3.     The Offeror acknowledges that Canada relies upon such representation 
       and warranty to evaluate offers and to issue a standing offer as a 
       result of this request for standing offers.  Such representation and 
       warranty of Canadian content may be verified in such manner as 
       Canada may reasonably require.

4.     Should a verification by Canada disclose a breach of such covenant, 
       Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       Standing Offer as being in default.

5.     Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph and to include it with 
       the offer will render the offer non-responsive.
