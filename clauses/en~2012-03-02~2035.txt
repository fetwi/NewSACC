<h2>2035 02 (2008-05-12) Standard Clauses and Conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public Works and Government
Services Act</cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada ">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. 16, the clauses and conditions
identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2>2035 03 (2008-05-12) Powers of Canada</h2>
<p>All rights, remedies, powers and discretions granted or acquired
by Canada under the Contract or by law are cumulative, not
exclusive.</p>
<h2>2035 04 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent contractor engaged by Canada to
perform the Work. Nothing in the Contract is intended to create a
partnership, a joint venture or an agency between Canada and the
other Party or Parties. The Contractor must not represent itself as
an agent or representative of Canada to anyone. Neither the
Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee or
agent of Canada. The Contractor is responsible for all deductions
and remittances required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2>2035 05 (2012-03-02) Conduct of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor represents and warrants that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">it is competent to perform the Work;</li>
<li value="2">it has everything necessary to perform the Work,
including the resources, facilities, labour, technology, equipment,
and materials; and</li>
<li value="3">it has the necessary qualifications, including
knowledge, skill, know-how and experience, and the ability to use
them effectively to perform the Work.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">perform the Work diligently and efficiently;</li>
<li value="2">except for Government Property, supply everything
necessary to perform the Work;</li>
<li value="3">use, as a minimum, quality assurance procedures,
inspections and controls generally used and recognized by the
industry to ensure the degree of quality required by the
Contract;</li>
<li value="4">select and employ a sufficient number of qualified
people;</li>
<li value="5">perform the Work in accordance with standards of
quality acceptable to Canada and in full conformity with the
Specifications and all the requirements of the Contract;</li>
<li value="6">provide effective and efficient supervision to ensure
that the quality of workmanship meets the requirements of the
Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">The Work must not be performed by any person who, in the opinion of Canada, is incompetent, unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly.</li>
<li value="4">All services rendered under the Contract must, at the
time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform
to the requirements of the Contract. If the Contractor is required
to correct or replace the Work or any part of the Work, it will be
at no cost to Canada.</li>
<li value="5">Canada's facilities, equipment and personnel are not
available to the Contractor to perform the Work unless the Contract
specifically provides for it. The Contractor is responsible for
advising the Contracting Authority in advance if it requires access
to Canada's facilities, equipment or personnel to perform the Work.
The Contractor must comply and ensure that its employees and
subcontractors comply with all security measures, standing orders,
policies or other rules in force at the site where the Work is
performed.</li>
<li value="6">Unless the Contracting Authority orders the
Contractor to suspend the Work or part of the Work pursuant to
section 28, the Contractor must not stop or suspend the Work or
part of the Work pending the settlement of any dispute between the
Parties about the Contract.</li>
<li value="7">The Contractor must provide all reports that are
required by the Contract and any other information that Canada may
reasonably require from time to time.</li>
<li value="8">The Contractor is fully responsible for performing
the Work. Canada will not be responsible for any negative
consequences or extra costs if the Contractor follows any advice
given by Canada unless the Contracting Authority provides the
advice to the Contractor in writing and includes a statement
specifically relieving the Contractor of any responsibility for
negative consequences or extra costs that might result from
following the advice.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 06 (2010-01-11) Subcontracts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Except as provided in subsection 2, the Contractor
must obtain the Contracting Authority's written consent before
subcontracting or permitting the subcontracting of any part of the
Work. A subcontract includes a contract entered into by any
subcontractor at any tier to perform any part of the Work.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor is not required to obtain consent for
subcontracts specifically authorized in the Contract. The
Contractor may also without the consent of the Contracting
Authority:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">purchase "off-the-shelf" items and any standard
articles and materials that are ordinarily produced by
manufacturers in the normal course of business;</li>
<li value="2">subcontract any portion of the Work as is customary
in the carrying out of similar contracts; and;</li>
<li value="3">permit its subcontractors at any tier to make
purchases or subcontract as permitted in paragraphs (a) and
(b).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">In any subcontract other than a subcontract referred
to in paragraph 2.(a), the Contractor must, unless the Contracting
Authority agrees in writing, ensure that the subcontractor is bound
by conditions compatible with and, in the opinion of the
Contracting Authority, not less favourable to Canada than the
conditions of the Contract.</li>
<li value="4">Even if Canada consents to a subcontract, the
Contractor is responsible for performing the Contract and Canada is
not responsible to any subcontractor. The Contractor is responsible
for any matters or things done or provided by any subcontractor
under the Contract and for paying any subcontractors for any part
of the Work they perform.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 07 (2008-05-12) Specifications</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All Specifications provided by Canada or on behalf of
Canada to the Contractor in connection with the Contract belong to
Canada and must be used by the Contractor only for the purpose of
performing the Work.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contract provides that Specifications
furnished by the Contractor must be approved by Canada, that
approval will not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to
meet all requirements of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 08 (2008-05-12) Replacement of Specific Individuals</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If specific individuals are identified in the
Contract to perform the Work, the Contractor must provide the
services of those individuals unless the Contractor is unable to do
so for reasons beyond its control.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor is unable to provide the services
of any specific individual identified in the Contract, it must
provide a replacement with similar qualifications and experience.
The replacement must meet the criteria used in the selection of the
Contractor and be acceptable to Canada. The Contractor must, as
soon as possible, give notice to the Contracting Authority of the
reason for replacing the individual and provide:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the name, qualifications and experience of the
proposed replacement; and</li>
<li value="2">proof that the proposed replacement has the required
security clearance granted by Canada, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor must not, in any event, allow
performance of the Work by unauthorized replacement persons. The
Contracting Authority may order that a replacement stop performing
the Work. In such a case, the Contractor must immediately comply
with the order and secure a further replacement in accordance with
subsection 2. The fact that the Contracting Authority does not
order that a replacement stop performing the Work does not relieve
the Contractor from its responsibility to meet the requirements of
the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 09 (2008-05-12) Time of the Essence</h2>
<p>It is essential that the Work be performed within or at the time
stated in the Contract.</p>
<h2>2035 10 (2008-05-12) Excusable Delay</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any
obligation under the Contract that is caused by an event that
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">is beyond the reasonable control of the
Contractor,</li>
<li value="2">could not reasonably have been foreseen,</li>
<li value="3">could not reasonably have been prevented by means
reasonably available to the Contractor, and</li>
<li value="4">occurred without the fault or neglect of the
Contractor,</li>
</ol>
<p>will be considered an "Excusable Delay" if the Contractor
advises the Contracting Authority of the occurrence of the delay or
of the likelihood of the delay as soon as the Contractor becomes
aware of it. The Contractor must also advise the Contracting
Authority, within fifteen (15) working days, of all the
circumstances relating to the delay and provide to the Contracting
Authority for approval a clear work around plan explaining in
detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to
minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Any delivery date or other date that is directly
affected by an Excusable Delay will be postponed for a reasonable
time that will not exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="3">However, if an Excusable Delay has continued for
thirty (30) days or more, the Contracting Authority may, by giving
notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the Contract. In
such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim
against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other
loss arising out of the termination or the event that contributed
to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately
to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated
at the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Unless Canada has caused the delay by failing to meet
an obligation under the Contract, Canada will not be responsible
for any costs incurred by the Contractor or any of its
subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="5">If the Contract is terminated under this section, the
Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to
Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting
Authority, any completed parts of the Work not delivered and
accepted before the termination and anything that the Contractor
has acquired or produced specifically to perform the Contract.
Canada will pay the Contractor:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the value, of all completed parts of the Work
delivered to and accepted by Canada, based on the Contract Price,
including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee
included in the Contract Price; and</li>
<li value="2">the Cost to the Contractor that Canada considers
reasonable in respect of anything else delivered to and accepted by
Canada.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total amount paid by Canada under the Contract to the date
of termination and any amounts payable under this subsection must
not exceed the Contract Price.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 11 (2008-05-12) Inspection and Acceptance of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance
by Canada. Inspection and acceptance of the Work by Canada do not
relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for defects or other
failures to meet the requirements of the Contract. Canada will have
the right to reject any Work that is not in accordance with the
requirements of the Contract and require its correction or
replacement at the Contractor's expense.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must provide representatives of Canada
access to all locations where any part of the Work is being
performed at any time during working hours. Representatives of
Canada may make examinations and such tests of the Work as they may
think fit. The Contractor must provide all assistance and
facilities, test pieces, samples and documentation that the
representatives of Canada may reasonably require for the carrying
out of the inspection. The Contractor must forward such test pieces
and samples to such person or location as Canada specifies.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor must inspect and approve any part of
the Work before submitting it for acceptance or delivering it to
Canada. The Contractor must keep accurate and complete inspection
records that must be made available to Canada on request.
Representatives of Canada may make copies and take extracts of the
records during the performance of the Contract and for up to three
(3) years after the end of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 12 (2008-05-12) Invoice Submission</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name.
The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment;
invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must
indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</li>
<li value="2">Invoices must show:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the date, the name and address of the client
department, item or reference numbers, deliverable and/or
description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number
(CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial
code(s);</li>
<li value="2">details of expenditures in accordance with the Basis
of Payment, exclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized
Sales Tax (HST) (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price,
fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as
applicable);</li>
<li value="3">deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li value="5">if applicable, the method of shipment together with
date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">If applicable, the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> must be specified on
all invoices as a separate item. All items that are zero-rated,
exempt or to which the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> does not apply, must be
identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li value="4">By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 13 (2010-08-16) Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Municipal Taxes
<p>Municipal Taxes do not apply.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Provincial Taxes
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Excluding legislated exceptions, federal government
departments and agencies are not required to pay any sales tax
payable to the province in which the taxable goods or services are
delivered. This exemption has been provided to federal government
departments and agencies under the authority of one of the
following:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Exemption Licence Numbers,
for the provinces of:
<p>Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250</p>
<p>Manitoba 390-516-0</p>
</li>
<li value="2">for Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, the
Northwest Territories and Nunavut, an Exemption Certification,
which certifies that the goods or services purchased are not
subject to the provincial/territorial sales and consumption taxes
because they are purchased by the federal government with Canada
funds for the use of the federal government.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Currently, in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, the
Northwest Territories and Nunavut, there is no general PST.
However, if a PST is introduced in Alberta, the Yukon Territory,
the Northwest Territories or Nunavut, the sales tax exemption
certificate would be required on the purchasing document.</li>
<li value="3">Federal departments must pay the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in the
participating provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Ontario and British Columbia.</li>
<li value="4">The Contractor is not exempt from paying PST under
the above Exemption Licence Numbers or Exemption Certification. The
Contractor must pay the PST on taxable goods or services used or
consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with
applicable provincial legislation), including material incorporated
into real property.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Changes to Taxes and Duties
<p>If there is any change to any tax or duty payable to any level
of government in Canada after the bid submission date that affects
the costs of the Work to the Contractor, the Contract Price will be
adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the cost to the
Contractor. However, there will be no adjustment for any change
that increases the cost of the Work to the Contractor if public
notice of the change was given before bid submission date in
sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the
effect of the change on its cost. There will be no adjustment if
the change takes effect after the date required by the Contract for
delivery of the Work.</p>
</li>
<li value="4">GST or <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>
<p>The estimated <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>, if applicable, is included in the
total estimated cost on page 1 of the Contract. The <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> is
not included in the Contract Price but will be paid by Canada as
provided in the Invoice Submission section above. The Contractor
agrees to remit to Canada Revenue Agency any amounts of <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> and <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>
paid or due.</p>
</li>
<li value="5">Tax Withholding of 15 Percent
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. 1 (5th
Supp.) and the <cite>Income Tax Regulations</cite>, Canada must
withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in
respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is a
non-resident unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver. The
amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in
respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 14 (2010-01-11) Transportation Costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2>2035 15 (2010-01-11) Transportation Carriers' Liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2>2035 16 (2008-05-12) Payment Period</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada's standard payment period is thirty (30) days.
The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31<sup>st</sup> day following that date and interest will be paid automatically in accordance with the section 17.</li>
<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within fifteen (15) days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 17 (2008-12-12) Interest on Overdue Accounts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">For the purpose of this section:
<p><dfn>"Average Rate"</dfn> means the simple arithmetic mean of the
Bank Rates in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time each day during the
calendar month immediately before the calendar month in which
payment is made;</p>
<p><dfn>"Bank Rate"</dfn> means the rate of interest established from
time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the
Bank of Canada makes short term advances to members of the Canadian
Payments Association;</p>
<p><dfn>"date of payment"</dfn> means the date of the negotiable
instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada to pay any
amount under the Contract;</p>
<p>an amount becomes <dfn>"overdue"</dfn> when it is unpaid on the first day following the day on which it is due and payable according to the Contract.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Canada will pay to the Contractor simple interest at
the Average Rate plus 3 percent per year on any amount that is
overdue, from the date that amount becomes overdue until the day
before the date of payment, inclusive. The Contractor is not
required to provide notice to Canada for interest to be
payable.</li>
<li value="3">Canada will pay interest in accordance with this
section only if Canada is responsible for the delay in paying the
Contractor. Canada will not pay interest on overdue advance
payments.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 18 (2008-05-12) Compliance with Applicable Laws</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must comply with all laws applicable
to the performance of the Contract. The Contractor must provide
evidence of compliance with such laws to Canada at such times as
Canada may reasonably request.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must obtain and maintain at its own
cost all permits, licenses, regulatory approvals and certificates
required to perform the Work. If requested by the Contracting
Authority, the Contractor must provide a copy of any required
permit, license, regulatory approvals or certificate to
Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 19 (2008-05-12) Ownership</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, the Work
or any part of the Work belongs to Canada after delivery and
acceptance by or on behalf of Canada.</li>
<li value="2">However if any payment is made to the Contractor for
or on account of any Work, either by way of progress or milestone
payments, that work paid for by Canada belongs to Canada upon such
payment being made. This transfer of ownership does not constitute
acceptance by Canada of the Work or any part of the Work and does
not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">Despite any transfer of ownership, the Contractor is
responsible for any loss or damage to the Work or any part of the
Work until it is delivered to Canada in accordance with the
Contract. Even after delivery, the Contractor remains responsible
for any loss or damage to any part of the Work caused by the
Contractor or any subcontractor.</li>
<li value="4">Upon transfer of ownership to the Work or any part of
the Work to Canada, the Contractor must, if requested by Canada,
establish to Canada's satisfaction that the title is free and clear
of all claims, liens, attachments, charges or encumbrances. The
Contractor must execute any conveyances and other instruments
necessary to perfect the title that Canada may require.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 20 (2008-05-12) Copyright</h2>
<p>In this section, <dfn>"Material"</dfn> means anything that is
created by the Contractor as part of the Work under the Contract,
that is required by the Contract to be delivered to Canada and in
which copyright subsists. <dfn>"Material"</dfn> does not include anything created by the Contractor before the date of the Contract.</p>
<p>Copyright in the Material belongs to Canada and the Contractor
must include the copyright symbol and either of the following
notice on the Material: Â© Her Majesty the Queen in right of
Canada <var>(year)</var> or <span lang="fr-CA">Â© Sa MajestÃ© la Reine du chef du Canada <var>(annÃ©e)</var></span>.</p>
<p>The Contractor must not use, copy, divulge or publish any
Material except as is necessary to perform the Contract. The
Contractor must execute any conveyance and other documents relating
to copyright in the Material as Canada may require.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide at the request of Canada a written
permanent waiver of moral rights, in a form acceptable to Canada,
from every author that contributed to the Material. If the
Contractor is the author of the Material, the Contractor
permanently waives its moral rights in the Material.</p>
<h2>2035 21 (2008-05-12) Translation of Documentation</h2>
<p>The Contractor agrees that Canada may translate in the other
official language any documentation delivered to Canada by the
Contractor that does not belong to Canada under section 20. The
Contractor acknowledges that Canada owns the translation and that
it is under no obligation to provide any translation to the
Contractor. Canada agrees that any translation must include any
copyright notice and any proprietary right notice that was part of
the original. Canada acknowledges that the Contractor is not
responsible for any technical errors or other problems that may
arise as a result of the translation.</p>
<h2>2035 22 (2008-05-12) Confidentiality</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must keep confidential all information

subcontractor any information necessary to perform the subcontract
as long as the subcontractor agrees to keep the information
confidential and that it will be used only to perform the
subcontract.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor agrees to use any information provided

the Contract. The Contractor acknowledges that all this information
remains the property of Canada or the third party, as the case may
be. Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, the Contractor must

an obligation to the other Party not to disclose the information;
or</li>
<li value="3">is developed by a Party without use of the

</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">Wherever possible, the Contractor must mark or
identify any proprietary information delivered to Canada under the
Contract as <q>"Property of <var>(Contractor's name)</var>, permitted Government uses defined under Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC) Contract <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <var>(fill in Contract Number)</var>"</q>. Canada will not be liable
for any unauthorized use or disclosure of information that could
have been so marked or identified and was not.</li>
<li value="6">If the Contract, the Work, or any information
referred to in subsection 1 is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET,
CONFIDENTIAL, or PROTECTED by Canada, the Contractor must at all
times take all measures reasonably necessary for the safeguarding
of the material so identified, including those set out in the <cite>PWGSC Industrial Security Manual</cite> and its supplements and any other instructions issued by Canada.</li>

CONFIDENTIAL, or PROTECTED, by Canada, representatives of Canada
are entitled to inspect the Contractor's premises and the premises
of a subcontractor at any tier for security purposes at any time

and ensure that any subcontractor complies with, all written
instructions issued by Canada dealing with the material so
identified, including any requirement that employees of the
Contractor or of any subcontractor execute and deliver declarations

</ol>
<h2>2035 23 (2008-05-12) Government Property</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All Government Property must be used by the
Contractor solely for the purpose of the Contract and remains the
property of Canada. The Contractor must maintain adequate
accounting records of all Government Property and, whenever
feasible, mark it as being the property of Canada.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care
of all Government Property while it is in its possession or subject
to its control. The Contractor is responsible for any loss or
damage resulting from its failure to do so other than loss or
damage caused by ordinary wear and tear.</li>
<li value="3">All Government Property, unless it is installed or
incorporated in the Work, must be returned to Canada on demand. All
scrap and all waste materials, articles or things that are
Government Property must, unless provided otherwise in the
Contract, remain the property of Canada and must be disposed of
only as directed by Canada.</li>
<li value="4">At the time of completion of the Contract, and if
requested by the Contracting Authority, the Contractor must provide
to Canada an inventory of all Government Property relating to the
Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 24 (2008-05-12) Liability</h2>
<p>The Contractor is liable for any damage caused by the
Contractor, its employees, subcontractors, or agents to Canada or
any third party. Canada is liable for any damage caused by Canada,
its employees or agents to the Contractor or any third party. The
Parties agree that no limitation of liability or indemnity
provision applies to the Contract unless it is specifically
incorporated in full text in the Articles of Agreement. Damage
includes any injury to persons (including injury resulting in
death) or loss of or damage to property (including real property)
caused as a result of or during the performance of the
Contract.</p>
<h2>2035 25 (2008-05-12) Intellectual Property Infringement and
Royalties</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor represents and warrants that, to the
best of its knowledge, neither it nor Canada will infringe any
third party's intellectual property rights in performing or using
the Work, and that Canada will have no obligation to pay royalties
of any kind to anyone in connection with the Work.</li>
<li value="2">If anyone makes a claim against Canada or the
Contractor concerning intellectual property infringement or
royalties related to the Work, that Party agrees to notify the
other Party in writing immediately. If anyone brings a claim
against Canada, according to <cite>Department of Justice
Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes (1985)">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. J-2, the Attorney General of Canada must
have the regulation and conduct of all litigation for or against
Canada, but the Attorney General may request that the Contractor
defend Canada against the claim. In either case, the Contractor
agrees to participate fully in the defence and any settlement
negotiations and to pay all costs, damages and legal costs incurred
or payable as a result of the claim, including the amount of any
settlement. Both Parties agree not to settle any claim unless the
other Party first approves the settlement in writing.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor has no obligation regarding claims
that were only made because:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Canada modified the Work or part of the Work without
the Contractor's consent or used the Work or part of the Work
without following a requirement of the Contract; or</li>
<li value="2">Canada used the Work or part of the Work with a
product that the Contractor did not supply under the Contract
(unless that use is described in the Contract or the manufacturer's
specifications); or</li>
<li value="3">the Contractor used equipment, drawings,
specifications or other information supplied to the Contractor by
Canada (or by someone authorized by Canada); or</li>
<li value="4">the Contractor used a specific item of equipment or
software that it obtained because of specific instructions from the
Contracting Authority; however, this exception only applies if the
Contractor has included the following language in its own contract
with the supplier of that equipment or software: <q>"<var>[Supplier name]</var>
acknowledges that the purchased items will be used by the
Government of Canada. If a third party claims that equipment or
software supplied under this contract infringes any intellectual
property right, <var>[supplier name]</var>, if requested to do so by either
<var>[Contractor name]</var> or Canada, will defend both <var>[Contractor name]</var> and
Canada against that claim at its own expense and will pay all
costs, damages and legal fees payable as a result of that
infringement."</q> Obtaining this protection from the supplier is the
Contractor's responsibility and, if the Contractor does not do so,
it will be responsible to Canada for the claim.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">If anyone claims that, as a result of the Work, the
Contractor or Canada is infringing its intellectual property
rights, the Contractor must immediately do one of the following:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">take whatever steps are necessary to allow Canada to
continue to use the allegedly infringing part of the Work; or</li>
<li value="2">modify or replace the Work to avoid intellectual
property infringement, while ensuring that the Work continues to
meet all the requirements of the Contract; or</li>
<li value="3">take back the Work and refund any part of the
Contract Price that Canada has already paid.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Contractor determines that none of these alternatives can
reasonably be achieved, or if the Contractor fails to take any of
these steps within a reasonable amount of time, Canada may choose
either to require the Contractor to do (c), or to take whatever
steps are necessary to acquire the rights to use the allegedly
infringing part(s) of the Work itself, in which case the Contractor
must reimburse Canada for all the costs it incurs to do so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 26 (2008-05-12) Amendment and Waivers</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">To be effective, any amendment to the Contract must
be done in writing by the Contracting Authority and the authorized
representative of the Contractor.</li>
<li value="2">While the Contractor may discuss any proposed
modifications to the Work with other representatives of Canada,
Canada will not be responsible for the cost of any modification
unless it has been incorporated into the Contract in accordance
with subsection 1.</li>
<li value="3">A waiver will only be valid, binding or affect the
rights of the Parties if it is made in writing by, in the case of a
waiver by Canada, the Contracting Authority and, in the case of a
waiver by the Contractor, the authorized representative of the
Contractor.</li>
<li value="4">The waiver by a Party of a breach of any condition of
the Contract will not be treated or interpreted as a waiver of any
subsequent breach and therefore will not prevent that Party from
enforcing of that term or condition in the case of a subsequent
breach.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 27 (2008-05-12) Assignment</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must not assign the Contract without
first obtaining the written consent of the Contracting Authority.
Any assignment made without that consent is void and will have no
effect. The assignment will be effective upon execution of an
assignment agreement signed by the Parties and the assignee.</li>
<li value="2">Assignment of the Contract does not relieve the
Contractor from any obligation under the Contract and it does not
impose any liability upon Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 28 (2008-05-12) Suspension of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contracting Authority may at any time, by written
notice, order the Contractor to suspend or stop the Work or part of
the Work under the Contract for a period of up to one hundred
eighty (180) days. The Contractor must immediately comply with any
such order in a way that minimizes the cost of doing so. While such
an order is in effect, the Contractor must not remove any part of
the Work from any premises without first obtaining the written
consent of the Contracting Authority. Within these one hundred
eighty (180) days, the Contracting Authority must either cancel the
order or terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, under section
29 or section 30.</li>
<li value="2">When an order is made under subsection 1, unless the
Contracting Authority terminates the Contract by reason of default
by the Contractor or the Contractor abandons the Contract, the
Contractor will be entitled to be paid its additional costs
incurred as a result of the suspension plus a fair and reasonable
profit.</li>
<li value="3">When an order made under subsection 1 is cancelled,
the Contractor must resume work in accordance with the Contract as
soon as practicable. If the suspension has affected the
Contractor's ability to meet any delivery date under the Contract,
the date for performing the part of the Work affected by the
suspension will be extended for a period equal to the period of
suspension plus a period, if any, that in the opinion of the
Contracting Authority, following consultation with the Contractor,
is necessary for the Contractor to resume the Work. Any equitable
adjustments will be made as necessary to any affected conditions of
the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 29 (2008-05-12) Default by the Contractor</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any
of its obligations under the Contract, the Contracting Authority
may, by giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate for
default the Contract or part of the Contract. The termination will
take effect immediately or at the expiration of a cure period
specified in the notice, if the Contractor has not cured the
default to the satisfaction of the Contracting Authority within
that cure period.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent,
makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the
benefit of any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors,
or if a receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a
receiving order is made against the Contractor, or an order is made
or a resolution passed for the winding down of the Contractor, the
Contracting Authority may, to the extent permitted by the laws of
Canada, by giving written notice to the Contractor, immediately
terminate for default the Contract or part of the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">If Canada gives notice under subsection 1 or 2, the
Contractor will have no claim for further payment except as
provided in this section. The Contractor will be liable to Canada
for all losses and damages suffered by Canada because of the
default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including
any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work
from another source. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to
Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at
the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Upon termination of the Contract under this section,
the Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to
Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting
Authority, any completed parts of the Work, not delivered and
accepted before the termination and anything the Contractor has
acquired or produced specifically to perform the Contract. In such
a case, subject to the deduction of any claim that Canada may have
against the Contractor arising under the Contract or out of the
termination, Canada will pay or credit to the Contractor:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the value, of all completed parts of the Work
delivered to and accepted by Canada, based on the Contract Price,
including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee
included in the Contract Price; and</li>
<li value="2">the cost to the Contractor that Canada considers
reasonable in respect of anything else delivered to and accepted by
Canada.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total amount paid by Canada under the Contract to the date
of the termination and any amount payable under this subsection
must not exceed the Contract Price.</p>
</li>
<li value="5">Title to everything for which payment is made to the
Contractor will, once payment is made, pass to Canada unless it
already belongs to Canada under any other provision of the
Contract.</li>
<li value="6">If the Contract is terminated for default under
subsection 1, but it is later determined that grounds did not exist
for a termination for default, the notice will be considered a
notice of termination for convenience issued under subsection 1 of
section 30.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 30 (2008-05-12) Termination for Convenience</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">At any time before the completion of the Work, the
Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the
Contractor, terminate for convenience the Contract or part of the
Contract. Once such a notice of termination for convenience is
given, the Contractor must comply with the requirements of the
termination notice. If the Contract is terminated in part only, the
Contractor must proceed to complete any part of the Work that is
not affected by the termination notice. The termination will take
effect immediately or, as the case may be, at the time specified in
the termination notice.</li>
<li value="2">If a termination notice is given pursuant to
subsection 1, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid, for costs
that have been reasonably and properly incurred to perform the
Contract to the extent that the Contractor has not already been
paid or reimbursed by Canada. The Contractor will be paid:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">on the basis of the Contract Price, for all completed
work that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the
Contract, whether completed before, or after the termination in
accordance with the instructions contained in the termination
notice;</li>
<li value="2">the Cost to the Contractor plus a fair and reasonable
profit for all work terminated by the termination notice before
completion; and</li>
<li value="3">all costs incidental to the termination of the Work
incurred by the Contractor but not including the cost of severance
payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer
required, except wages that the Contractor is obligated by statute
to pay.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Canada may reduce the payment in respect of any part
of the Work, if upon inspection, it does not meet the requirements
of the Contract.</li>
<li value="4">The total of the amounts, to which the Contractor is
entitled to be paid under this section, together with any amounts
paid, due or becoming due to the Contractor must not exceed the
Contract Price. The Contractor will have no claim for damages,
compensation, loss of profit, allowance arising out of any
termination notice given by Canada under this section except to the
extent that this section expressly provides. The Contractor agrees
to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment
that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 31 (2008-05-12) Accounts and Audit</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must keep proper accounts and records
of the cost of performing the Work and of all expenditures or
commitments made by the Contractor in connection with the Work,
including all invoices, receipts and vouchers. The Contractor must
retain records, including bills of lading and other evidence of
transportation or delivery, for all deliveries made under the
Contract.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contract includes payment for time spent by
the Contractor, its employees, representatives, agents or
subcontractors performing the Work, the Contractor must keep a
record of the actual time spent each day by each individual
performing any part of the Work.</li>
<li value="3">Unless Canada has consented in writing to its
disposal, the Contractor must retain all the information described
in this section for six (6) years after it receives the final
payment under the Contract, or until the settlement of all
outstanding claims and disputes, whichever is later. During this
time, the Contractor must make this information available for
audit, inspection and examination by the representatives of Canada,
who may make copies and take extracts. The Contractor must provide
all reasonably required facilities for any audit and inspection and
must furnish all the information as the representatives of Canada
may from time to time require to perform a complete audit of the
Contract.</li>
<li value="4">The amount claimed under the contract, calculated in
accordance with the Basis of Payment provision in the Articles of
Agreement, is subject to government audit both before and after
payment is made. If an audit is performed after payment, the
Contractor agrees to repay any overpayment immediately on demand by
Canada. Canada may hold back, deduct and set off any credits owing
and unpaid under this section from any money that Canada owes to
the Contractor at any time (including under other contracts). If
Canada does not choose to exercise this right at any given time,
Canada does not lose this right.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 32 (2008-05-12) Right of Set-off</h2>
<p>Without restricting any right of set-off given by law, Canada
may set-off against any amount payable to the Contractor under the
Contract, any amount payable to Canada by the Contractor under the
Contract or under any other current contract. Canada may, when
making a payment pursuant to the Contract, deduct from the amount
payable to the Contractor any such amount payable to Canada by the
Contractor which, by virtue of the right of set-off, may be
retained by Canada.</p>
<h2>2035 33 (2008-05-12) Notice</h2>
<p>Any notice under the Contract must be in writing and may be
delivered by hand, courier, mail, facsimile or other electronic
method that provides a paper record of the text of the notice. It
must be sent to the Party for whom it is intended at the address
stated in the Contract. Any notice will be effective on the day it
is received at that address. Any notice to Canada must be delivered
to the Contracting Authority.</p>
<h2>2035 34 (2008-05-12) Conflict of Interest and Values and Ethics
Codes for the Public Service</h2>

the provisions of the <cite>Conflict of Interest Act</cite>, 2006,
 <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. 9, s. 2, the <cite>Conflict of Interest Code for Members of the House
of Commons</cite>, the <cite>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service</cite> or all other codes of values and ethics applicable within specific organizations cannot derive any direct benefit resulting from the Contract.</p>
<h2>2035 35 (2008-05-12) No Bribe or Conflict</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor declares that no bribe, gift, benefit,
or other inducement has been or will be paid, given, promised or
offered directly or indirectly to any official or employee of
Canada or to a member of the family of such a person, with a view
to influencing the entry into the Contract or the administration of
the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must not influence, seek to influence
or otherwise take part in a decision of Canada knowing that the
decision might further its private interest. The Contractor must
have no financial interest in the business of a third party that
causes or would appear to cause a conflict of interest in
connection with the performance of its obligations under the
Contract. If such a financial interest is acquired during the
period of the Contract, the Contractor must immediately declare it
to the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor warrants that, to the best of its
knowledge after making diligent inquiry, no conflict exists or is
likely to arise in the performance of the Contract. In the event
the Contractor becomes aware of any matter that causes or is likely
to cause a conflict in relation to the Contractor's performance
under the Contract, the Contractor must immediately disclose such
matter to the Contracting Authority in writing.</li>
<li value="4">If the Contracting Authority is of the opinion that a
conflict exists as a result of the Contractor's disclosure or as a
result of any other information brought to the Contracting
Authority's attention, the Contracting Authority may require the
Contractor to take steps to resolve or otherwise deal with the
conflict or, at its entire discretion, terminate the Contract for
default. Conflict means any matter, circumstance, interest, or
activity affecting the Contractor, its personnel or subcontractors,
which may or may appear to impair the ability of the Contractor to
perform the Work diligently and independently.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2035 36 (2008-05-12) Survival</h2>
<p>All the Parties' obligations of confidentiality, representations
and warranties set out in the Contract as well as the provisions,
which by the nature of the rights or obligations might reasonably
be expected to survive, will survive the expiry or termination of
the Contract.</p>
<h2>2035 37 (2008-05-12) Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of the Contract is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
that provision will be removed from the Contract without affecting
any other provision of the Contract.</p>
<h2>2035 38 (2008-05-12) Successors and Assigns</h2>

for the convenience of Canada in accordance with section 30.</li>
