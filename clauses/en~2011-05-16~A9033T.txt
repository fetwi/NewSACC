<ol type="1">
<li value="1"><strong>Financial Capability Requirement</strong>:
The Bidder must have the financial capability to fulfill this
requirement. To determine the Bidder's financial capability, the
Contracting Authority may, by written notice to the Bidder, require
the submission of some or all of the financial information detailed
below during the evaluation of bids. The Bidder must provide the
following information to the Contracting Authority within fifteen
(15) working days of the request or as specified by the Contracting
Authority in the notice:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Audited financial statements, if available, or the
unaudited financial statements (prepared by the Bidder's outside
accounting firm, if available, or prepared in-house if no external
statements have been prepared) for the Bidder's last three fiscal
years, or for the years that the Bidder has been in business if
this is less than three years (including, as a minimum, the Balance
Sheet, the Statement of Retained Earnings, the Income Statement and
any notes to the statements).</li>
<li value="2">If the date of the financial statements in (a) above
is more than five months before the date of the request for
information by the Contracting Authority, the Bidder must also
provide, unless this is prohibited by legislation for public
companies, the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a
Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement), as of two
months before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests
this information.</li>
<li value="3">If the Bidder has not been in business for at least
one full fiscal year, the following must be provided:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the opening Balance Sheet on commencement of business
(in the case of a corporation, the date of incorporation); and</li>
<li value="2">the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a
Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement) as of two months
before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this
information.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">A certification from the Chief Financial Officer or
an authorized signing officer of the Bidder that the financial
information provided is complete and accurate.</li>
<li value="5">A confirmation letter from all of the financial
institution(s) that have provided short-term financing to the
Bidder outlining the total of lines of credit granted to the Bidder
and the amount of credit that remains available and not drawn upon
as of one month prior to the date on which the Contracting
Authority requests this information.</li>
<li value="6">A detailed monthly Cash Flow Statement covering all
the Bidder's activities (including the requirement) for the first
two years of the requirement that is the subject of the bid
solicitation, unless this is prohibited by legislation. This
statement must detail the Bidder's major sources and amounts of
cash and the major items of cash expenditures on a monthly basis,
for all the Bidder's activities. All assumptions made should be
explained as well as details of how cash shortfalls will be
financed.</li>
<li value="7">A detailed monthly Project Cash Flow Statement
covering the first two years of the requirement that is the subject
of the bid solicitation, unless this is prohibited by legislation.
This statement must detail the Bidder's major sources and amounts
of cash and the major items of cash expenditures, for the
requirement, on a monthly basis. All assumptions made should be
explained as well as details of how cash shortfalls will be
financed.</li>
</ol></li>
<li value="2">If the Bidder is a joint venture, the financial
information required by the Contracting Authority must be provided
by each member of the joint venture.</li>
<li value="3">If the Bidder is a subsidiary of another company,
then any financial information in 1. (a) to (f) above required by
the Contracting Authority must be provided by the ultimate parent
company. Provision of parent company financial information does not
satisfy the requirement for the provision of the financial
information of the Bidder, and the financial capability of a parent
cannot be substituted for the financial capability of the Bidder
itself unless an agreement by the parent company to sign a Parental
Guarantee, as drawn up by Public Works and Government Services
Canada (PWGSC), is provided with the required information.</li>
<li value="4"><strong>Financial Information Already Provided to
PWGSC</strong>: The Bidder is not required to resubmit any
financial information requested by the Contracting Authority that
is already on file at <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with the Contract Cost Analysis, Audit
and Policy Directorate of the Policy, Risk, Integrity and Strategic
Management Sector, provided that within the above-noted time frame:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Bidder identifies to the Contracting Authority in
writing the specific information that is on file and the
requirement for which this information was provided; and</li>
<li value="2">the Bidder authorizes the use of the information for
this requirement.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the Bidder's responsibility to confirm with the
Contracting Authority that this information is still on file with
PWGSC.</p>
</li>
<li value="5"><strong>Other Information</strong>: Canada reserves
the right to request from the Bidder any other information that
Canada requires to conduct a complete financial capability
assessment of the Bidder.</li>
<li value="6"><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: If the Bidder
provides the information required above to Canada in confidence
while indicating that the disclosed information is confidential,
then Canada will treat the information in a confidential manner as
permitted by the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes (1985)">R.S.</abbr>,
1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. A-1, Section 20(1) (b) and (c).</li>
<li value="7"><strong>Security</strong>: In determining the
Bidder's financial capability to fulfill this requirement, Canada
may consider any security the Bidder is capable of providing, at
the Bidder's sole expense (for example, an irrevocable letter of
credit from a registered financial institution drawn in favour of
Canada, a performance guarantee from a third party or some other
form of security, as determined by Canada).</li>
