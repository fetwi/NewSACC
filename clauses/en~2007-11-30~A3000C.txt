<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor warrants that the certification of compliance with 
       the definition of an Aboriginal business set out in the Requirements 
       for the Set-aside Program for Aboriginal Business submitted by the 
       Contractor is accurate and complete.

2.     The Contractor must keep proper records and documentation relating 
       to the accuracy of the certification provided to Canada. The 
       Contractor must not, without obtaining prior written consent of the 
       Contracting Authority, dispose of any such records or documentation 
       supporting the accuracy of the certification until the expiration of 
       six (6) years after final payment under the Contract, or until 
       settlement of all outstanding claims and disputes, resulting from a 
       dispute under the Contract, whichever is later. All such records and 
       documentation must at all times during the retention period be open 
       to audit, inspection and examination by representatives of Canada, 
       who may make copies and take extracts. The Contractor must provide 
       all facilities for such audits, inspections and examinations, and 
       must furnish all such information as the representatives of Canada 
       may from time to time require with respect to such records and 
       documentation.

3.     Nothing in this clause must be interpreted as limiting the rights 
       and remedies which Canada  may otherwise have pursuant to the 
       Contract.
