<pre>1.     Payment by Canada for the Work shall be made within:

       (a)    thirty (30) days following the date on which all of the Work 
              has been delivered at the location(s) specified in the 
              Contract and all other Work required to be performed by the 
              Contractor under the terms of the Contract has been completed; 
              or 

       (b)    thirty (30) days following the date on which an invoice and 
              substantiating documentation are received according to the 
              terms of the Contract;

       whichever is later.

2.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the invoice or the 
       substantiating documentation, within fifteen (15) days of its 
       receipt, Canada shall notify the Contractor of the nature of the 
       objection. "Form of the invoice" means an invoice which contains or 
       is accompanied by such substantiating documentation as Canada 
       requires. Failure by Canada to act within fifteen (15) days will 
       only result in the date specified in paragraph 1 of the clause to 
       apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest on overdue 
       accounts.
