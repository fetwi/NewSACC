<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Persons in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada, are bound by 
       economic sanctions imposed by Canada.  As a result, the Government 
       of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services that originate, 
       either directly or indirectly, from the countries or persons subject 
       to economic sanctions.

       Details on existing sanctions can be found at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/trade/
       sanctions-e.asp</strong>

2.     It is a condition of this Standing Offer and of any ensuing call-ups, 
       if any, that the Offeror not supply to the Government of Canada any 
       goods or services which are subject to economic sanctions.

3.     By law, the Offeror must comply with changes to the regulations 
       imposed during the life of the Standing Offer.  During the 
       performance of any call-up under the Standing Offer, should the 
       imposition of sanctions against a country or person or the addition 
       of a good or service to the list of sanctioned goods and services 
       prevent the Offeror from performing all or part of its obligations 
       pursuant to a call-up made against this Standing Offer, the Offeror 
       shall treat the situation as a force majeure.  The Offeror shall 
       forthwith inform Canada of the situation; the procedures applicable 
       to force majeure shall then apply.
