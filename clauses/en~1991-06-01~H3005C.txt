<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Milestone payments will be made in accordance with the Schedule of 
       Milestones attached as Annex "_____", provided that:

       (a)    the Contractor submits a claim for payment on form DSS-MAS 
              1111, Claim for Progress Payment. A sample is attached as 
              Annex "_____";

       (b)    all of the certificates appearing on the said form are signed 
              by the respective persons indicated thereon or their delegate; 
              and

       (c)    all reports required for the milestone claimed have been 
              received and accepted by the Scientific Authority.

2.     The claim must show the following:

       (a)    amount currently claimed;

       (b)    total of all previous claims against the Contract and the 
              extensions of the total to date;

       (c)    Requisition Number (RN), Financial Code (FC), and Contract 
              Number as shown on page 1 of this Contract.

3.     The Contractor shall prepare and certify an original and four (4) 
       copies of its claim on form DSS-MAS 1111.  The claim will be 
       forwarded to the Science Contracting Officer who will certify the 
       claim and forward it to the Scientific Authority for certification 
       and payment.

4.     The balance of the amount payable will be made following:

       (a)    delivery and acceptance of all deliverable items;

       (b)    the approval of the final claim by the Science Contracting 
              Officer and by the Scientific Authority.

5.     Payment by Canada to the Contractor for the Work shall be made:

       (a)    in the case of a milestone payment other than the final 
              payment, within thirty (30) days following the date of 
              receipt of a duly completed milestone claim on form DSS-MAS 
              1111;

       (b)    in the case of a final payment, within thirty (30) days 
              following the date of receipt of a duly completed final 
              milestone claim, on form DSS-MAS 1111, or within thirty (30) 
              days following the date on which the Work is completed, 
              whichever date is the later; 

       (c)    if Canada has any objection to the form of the milestone 
   claim, within fifteen (15) days of its receipt, Canada shall notify the 
   Contractor of the nature of the objection. "Form of the claim" means a 
   claim which contains or is accompanied by such substantiating 
   documentation as Canada requires.  Failure by Canada to act within 
   fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified in 
   subparagraphs 5(a) and (b) of this clause applying for the sole purpose 
   of calculating interest on overdue accounts.
