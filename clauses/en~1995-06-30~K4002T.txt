<pre>By executing this representation and warranty, the Bidder represents and 
warrants that, of the goods and services being offered to Canada, no less 
than 80 percent of the bid price consists of Canadian goods and Canadian 
services, as defined in the clause K4000D - Canadian Content Definition.

Bids that include this representation and warranty will be given preference 
over other bids, if there are three (3) or more bids with a valid 
certification. 

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation 
and warranty to evaluate bids and may rely upon such representation and 
warranty to enter into any contract resulting from this bid. Such 
representation and warranty of Canadian Content may be verified in such 
manner as the Minister may reasonably require.

Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such covenant, 
the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting from this 
bid as being in default.   

Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature block 
immediately following this paragraph or to include it with the bid may 
render the bid non-responsive.
