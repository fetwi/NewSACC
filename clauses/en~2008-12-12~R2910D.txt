<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
 These Insurance Terms are applicable to the majority of construction contracts 
that require insurance coverage for Commercial General Liability and Builder's 
Risk/Installation Floater.

Contracting officers must consult
 <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">
  PWGSC
 </abbr>
 Risk Management Advisory Services, at:
 
  NCR.RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca
 
 if the suggested limits of liability are not 
considered adequate.

Builder's Risk/Installation Floater insurance is generally not required for 
contracts were there is no work/property to ensure, such as paving, asbestos 
abatement and dredging.

Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance might not be sufficient or 
appropriate for certain construction contracts.  For work taking place on the 
airside of an airport,
 <abbr title="Commercial General Liability">
  CGL
 </abbr>
 should be substituted with Aviation Liability 
Insurance (G2030C). For work done from a floating plant or with a dredge,
 <abbr title="Commercial General Liability">
  CGL
 </abbr>
 should be substituted with Marine Liability Insurance (G5003C).
