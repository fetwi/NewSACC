<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>If any lien under section 427 of the Bank Act exists in respect to any 
materials, parts, work in process, or finished work for which the 
Contractor intends to claim payment, the Contractor agrees to inform the 
Minister without delay and agrees, unless otherwise instructed by the 
Minister, either

       1.  to cause the bank to remove such lien and to furnish the 
       Minister with written confirmation from the bank; or,

       2.  to furnish or cause to be furnished to the Minister an 
       undertaking from the bank to the Minister that the bank will not 
       make any claim under section 427 of the Bank Act on materials, parts, 
       work in process, or finished work in respect of which payment is 
       made to the Contractor under this Contract.

Failure to inform the Minister of such lien or failure to implement 
   paragraph 1. or 2. above shall constitute default under the clause 
   entitled "Default by Contractor" in the General Conditions of the 
   Contract and shall entitle the Minister to terminate the Contract.
