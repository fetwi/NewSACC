<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated
expenditure specified in a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) are
only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing
offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A
standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a
Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to
departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not
constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods,
services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or
several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2>01 Code of Conduct and Certifications - Offer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">
Offerors must comply with the <cite><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">Code of Conduct for Procurement</a></cite>.  In addition to the <cite><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">Code of Conduct for Procurement</a></cite>, offerors must a) respond to Requests for Standing Offers (RFSO) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, b) accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>, Standing Offers and resulting contracts, c) submit offers and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.
</li>
<li value="2">
Offerors further understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be issued a Standing Offer and awarded a contract.  Canada will declare non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada.  If it is determined, after issuance of a Standing Offer, that the Offeror made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to set aside the Standing Offer and to terminate for default any resulting contracts.  The Offeror will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested.  The Offeror and any of the Offeror’s parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any standing offer arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer.  Canada may verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.

For the purpose of this section, business concerns, organizations and individuals are Offeror’s affiliates if:

<li value="5">
The Offeror must diligently maintain the list up-to-date by informing Canada in writing of any change occuring during the validity period of the offer, and must also provide Canada with the corresponding Consent Forms.  The Offeror will also be required to diligently maintain the list and to provide Consent Forms during the period of any standing offer and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer.</li>
<li value="6">
By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies to be aware, and that its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates are aware, that Canada may verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.
