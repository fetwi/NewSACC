<li value="1">To comply with the <cite><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">
Code of Conduct for Procurement</a></cite>, proponents must respond to bid
solicitations in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner,
accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements
stipulated in the bid solicitation and resulting contract, submit
bids and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all
obligations of the Contract. To ensure fairness, openness and

anti-competitive activity in the bidding process for contracts for
the provision of goods or services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">By submitting a proposal, the Proponent certifies
that neither the Proponent nor any of the Proponent's Affiliates
has ever been convicted of a criminal offence in respect of the
activities stated in (a) or (b) above or is the subject of
outstanding criminal charges in respect of such activities filed
subsequent to September 1, 2010.</li>
<li value="3"><p>Proponents further understand that the commission of
certain offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a
contract. By submitting a proposal, the Proponent certifies that
neither the Proponent nor any of the Proponent's Affiliates has
ever been convicted or is the subject of outstanding criminal
charges in respect of an offence under any of the following
provisions:</p>
<p>Section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor

<li value="5">Except in the limited circumstances set out in
subsection 6 below, the Contracting Authority will declare
non-responsive any proposal in respect of which the information
contained in the certifications contemplated above is determined to
be untrue in any respect by the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="6">Subsection 5 has no application in the circumstances
where a proponent has pled guilty of an offence contemplated in
Section 1, 1. (b) and the Proponent has provided with its proposal
an assurance from the Competition Bureau of Canada indicating that
the Proponent has been granted leniency, or in the circumstances
where the Proponent provides documentation from the National Parole
Board that the Proponent has obtained a criminal pardon in relation
to such offence.</li>

<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI3 (2011-05-16) Overview
of Selection Procedure</h2>
<h3>3.1 Proposal</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Proposals are submitted following a "two-envelope"
procedure, in which Proponents submit the "technical" component of
their proposal in one envelope and the proposed price of the
services (price proposal) in a second envelope.</li>
<li value="2">The information that Proponents are required to
provide is set out in detail elsewhere in the RFP.</li>
<li value="3">In response to the RFP, interested Proponents submit
a proposal in which they:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">indicate whether the proposal is submitted by an
individual firm or by a joint venture;</li>
<li value="2">if the proposal is submitted by a joint venture,
describe the proposed legal and working relationships of the joint
venture and the benefits to be gained by the formation of the joint
venture;</li>
<li value="3">identify the prime consultants and key sub
consultants and specialists proposed for inclusion in the
Consultant Team, and the proposed organizational structure of the
Team;</li>
<li value="4">describe the extent to which proposed members of the
Consultant Team have successfully performed services for projects
comparable to the project which is the subject of the
proposal;</li>
<li value="5">identify the professional accreditation, experience,
expertise and competence of the Consultant Team and Key Personnel
proposed to be assigned to perform the required services.</li>
<li value="6">comply with all other requirements set out in the
RFP.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Proposal Evaluation and Rating</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Technical components of all responsive proposals are
reviewed, evaluated and rated by a Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) Evaluation Board in accordance with the
criteria, components and weight factors set out in the RFP. Upon
completion of the evaluation, Technical Ratings are
established.</li>
<li value="2">Proposals achieving the minimum Technical Score
specified in the Submission Requirements and Evaluation section of
the RFP are further considered.</li>
<li value="3">The price envelopes of all responsive proposals are
opened upon completion of the technical evaluation. When there are
three or more responsive proposals, an average price is determined
by adding all the price proposals together and dividing the total
by the number of price proposals opened. This calculation will not
be conducted when one or two responsive proposals are
received.</li>
<li value="4">All price proposals which are greater than 25 percent
above the average price will cause their respective complete
proposals to be set aside and receive no further
consideration.</li>
<li value="5">The remaining price proposals are rated as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">The lowest price proposal receives a Price Rating of
100.</li>
<li value="2">The second, third, fourth and fifth lowest prices
receive Price Ratings of 80, 60, 40, and 20 respectively. All other
price proposals receive a Price Rating of 0.</li>
<li value="3">On the rare occasion where two (or more) price
proposals are identical, these price proposals receive the same
rating and the corresponding number of following ratings are
skipped.</li>
<li value="4">The Price Rating is multiplied by a predetermined
percentage factor to establish a Price Score.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="6">A price proposal in excess of any maximum funding
limit, when this limit has been set in the Supplementary
Instructions to Proponents, may result in disqualification of the
complete proposal.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.3 Total Score</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The total overall score (Total Score) assigned to
each Proponent's complete proposal is calculated as the aggregate
of:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Technical Score (first envelope of the proposal),
and</li>
<li value="2">the Price Score (second envelope of the
proposal).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Proponent receiving the highest Total Score is
the first entity that the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Evaluation Board will recommend be
approached in order to finalize details of an agreement for the
provision of the required services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.4 Notification</h3>
<p>PWGSC normally expects to advise in writing unsuccessful
Proponents within one week after <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has entered into a
contractual arrangement with the successful Proponent.</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI4 (2010-08-16)
Procurement Business Number</h2>
<p>Canadian Proponents are required to have a Procurement Business

Canada</a> Web site. For non-Internet registration, Proponents may
contact the nearest <a href="http://www.contractscanada.gc.ca/pcif-srpc-eng.html" rel="external">Supplier
Registration Agent</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI5 (2003-05-30)
Responsive Proposals</h2>
<p>To be considered responsive, a proposal must meet all of the
mandatory requirements set out in the RFP. No further consideration
in the selection procedure will be given to a Proponent submitting
a non-responsive proposal.</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI6 (2011-05-16)
Completion of Submission</h2>
<p>The Proponent shall base the proposal on the applicable proposal

the Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax as may be
applicable, and</li>
<li value="3">exchange rate fluctuation protection is not offered,
and</li>
<li value="4">any request for exchange rate fluctuation protection
will not be considered, and may render the proposal
non-responsive.</li>
</ol>

Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive bid process,
enquiries and other communications regarding the RFP must be
directed only to the Contracting Authority identified in the RFP.
Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the proposal
being declared non-responsive.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to
proponents, significant enquiries received and the replies to such
enquiries will be provided simultaneously to proponents to which
the RFP has been sent, without revealing the sources of the
enquiries.</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI9 (2011-05-16)
Limitation of Submissions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A proponent may not submit more than one proposal.
This limitation also applies to the persons or entities in the case
of a joint venture. If more than one proposal is received from a
proponent (or, in the case of a joint venture, from the persons or
entities), all such proposals shall be rejected and no further
consideration shall be given.</li>
<li value="2">A joint venture is defined as an association of two
or more parties which combine their money, property, knowledge,
skills, time or other resources in a joint business enterprise
agreeing to share the profits and the losses and each having some
degree of control over the enterprise.</li>
<li value="3">An arrangement whereby Canada contracts directly with
a prime consultant who may retain sub-consultants or specialist
consultants to perform portions of the services is not a joint
venture arrangement. A sub-consultant or specialist consultant may,
therefore, be proposed as part of the Consultant Team by more than
one Proponent.</li>
<li value="4">Notwithstanding paragraph 3. above, in order to avoid
any conflict of interest, or any perception of conflict of
interest, no person or entity acting as an individual Proponent or
as part of a joint venture Proponent, shall be proposed as a member
of another Proponent's Consultant Team, either as a sub-consultant
or specialist consultant or as part of another joint venture
Proponent. Failure to comply with this limitation will result in
all submissions so involved being rejected.</li>
<li value="5">Any joint venture entered into for the provision of
professional services or other services must be in full compliance
with the requirements of any provincial or territorial law
pertaining thereto in the Province or Territory in which the
project is located.</li>

Territory in which the project is located.</li>
<li value="2">By virtue of submission of a proposal, the Proponent
certifies that the Proponent's Consultant Team and Key Personnel
are in compliance with the requirements of subsection 1 above. The
Proponent acknowledges that <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> reserves the right to verify any
information in this regard and that false or erroneous
certification may result in the proposal being declared
non-responsive.</li>

Rejection of Proposal</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may reject a proposal where any of the
following circumstances is present:

selection, following unsatisfactory performance in a previous
project as determined in accordance with the department's
performance review procedures;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant
included as part of the proposal has been declared ineligible, for
selection for work with the department in accordance with the
performance review procedure referred to in paragraph 1.(a), which
would render the employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant
ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion of the
requirement the employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant
is to perform;</li>
<li value="3">with respect to current or prior transactions with
the Government of Canada,
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the Proponent is bankrupt or where, for whatever
reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended
period;</li>

fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law
protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has
been received with respect to the Proponent, any of its employees,
any sub-consultant or any specialist consultant included as part of
the proposal;</li>
<li value="3">Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of taking
the services out of the consultant's hands, suspension or
termination for default with respect to a contract with the
Proponent, any of its employees, any sub-consultant or any
specialist consultant included as part of the proposal;</li>
<li value="4">Canada determines that the Proponent's performance on other
contracts, including the quality of the services provided and the
quality and timeliness of the delivery of the project, is
sufficiently poor to jeopardize the successful completion of the
requirement being bid on.</li>

precedent to contract award. If the Proponent, or, if the Proponent
is a joint venture and if any member of the joint venture, is
subject to the <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program ">FCP</abbr>, evidence of its commitment must be provided
before the award of the Contract.</p>
<p>Firms who have been declared ineligible contractors by Human
Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer
eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold for
solicitation of bids as set out in the <cite>Government Contracts
Regulations</cite>. Firms may be declared ineligible contractors
either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, or
following their voluntary withdrawal from the <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program ">FCP</abbr> for a reason
other than the reduction of their workforce to less than 100
employees. Any bids from ineligible contractors, including a bid
from a joint venture that has a member who is an ineligible
contractor, will be declared non-responsive.</p></li>

<li value="1">if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of
interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available
to other proponents and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or
appear to give the Proponent an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a proponent who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in
itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage
or creating a conflict of interest. This proponent remains however
subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a proposal under this
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Proponent and
provide the Proponent an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Proponents who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a proposal, the Proponent
represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of
interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Proponent
acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to
determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an
appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
