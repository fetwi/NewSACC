<pre>The following clauses must be incorporated into the conditions of the 
Contractor's Errors and Omissions Liability and Product Liability coverages:

(A)    "<strong>Litigation Rights</strong>:  It is understood and agreed that where any suit 
       is instituted for or against Canada which the Insurer, or Insurers 
       would, but for this clause, have the right to pursue or defend on 
       behalf of Canada under this insurance policy, the Insurer shall 
       promptly contact the Attorney General of Canada to agree on the 
       legal strategies by sending a registered letter to:

       Senior General Counsel
       Civil Litigation Section
       Department of Justice
       Kent and Wellington Streets
       Ottawa, Ontario  K1A 0H8

       The notification must be followed, within a reasonable period, by an 
       information copy to the Contracting Authority.

       The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right to co-defend 
       any action brought against Canada.  However, all expenses incurred 
       by Canada to co-defend such actions would be at Canada's expense."

(B)    "<strong>Notice of Cancellation or Amendments of Insurance Coverage</strong>:  The 
       Insurer agrees to give the Contracting Authority at least fifteen 
       (15) days' prior written notice of any policy cancellation or any 
       changes in the policy coverage."
