       Contractor of the correctness of that decision or direction, or 
       prevent the Contractor from taking whatever action the Contractor 
       considers appropriate in the circumstances.

       incurred by the Contractor in carrying out the protested decision or 
       direction.

8)     Costs referred to in paragraph 7) of GC8 shall be calculated in
