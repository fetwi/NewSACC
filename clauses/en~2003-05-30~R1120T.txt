1.     Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) intends to 
       retain an individual consulting firm or joint venture to provide the 
       professional services for the project as set out in this Request for 
       Proposal (RFP).

2.     Because of the considerable time and expense involved in the 
       preparation, submission and evaluation of full proposals, Proponents 
       responding to this RFP are requested to submit a proposal in two 
       phases.  Phase One proposals cover only the qualifications, 
       experience and organization of the proposed Consultant Team.  
       Following evaluation and rating of these proposals, Proponents are 
       advised of their competitive standing and have the opportunity to 
       decide whether or not to continue their participation by submitting 
       a Phase Two proposal.  Phase Two proposals cover the detailed 
       approach to the work, and the pricing offered.  A combination of the 
       Phase One and Phase Two submissions constitutes the final proposal.  
       This procedure follows "open tendering" procedures in the context of 
       Canada's trade agreements.  It is followed, however, whether or not 
       the procurement is covered by any trade agreement.

3.     Initially, firms are invited to submit a proposal in the first phase 
       of the selection procedure outlined herein.  Only the Phase One 
       information asked for in the RFP is to be included in the Phase One 
       proposal, and evaluation and rating of Phase One proposals will be 
       carried out only on the Phase One information requested.
