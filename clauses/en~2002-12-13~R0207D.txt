<strong>DR 01  (13/12/02)    Interpretation</strong>

1.1    In these Dispute Resolution Conditions and in the Rules attached 
       hereto, "arbitral question of law" means a question of law that:

       1.1.1  is capable of determination by arbitration under the laws of 
                     Canada, and

       1.1.2  does not involve interpretation or application of public law 
              of Canada, including without limitation any matter of 
              constitutional, administrative, criminal or tax law, and

       1.1.3  concerns: 

              1.1.3.1       the formation, validity, interpretation, 
                     application or enforce ability of the contract;

                     discharge of the contract;

              1.1.3.3       the rights, duties, obligations or remedies of 
                     parties created by or pursuant to the contract; or

              1.1.3.4       any other issue of private law that may arise 
                     between parties relative to performance of the 
                     contract;

       "dispute" means any disagreement regarding any issue identified by 
       the Contractor in the notice submitted to the Engineer in accordance 
       with DR 3.2, and includes any claim by the Contractor arising from 
       such disagreement and any counterclaim by Her Majesty, but does not 
       include any claim by either party for punitive or exemplary damages, 
       injury to persons, death, or any claim based on an allegation of 
       libel or slander;

       "working day" means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or a 
       holiday which is observed by the construction industry in the area 
       of the place of the work.

1.2    The alternative dispute resolution procedures set out in these 
       Dispute Resolution Conditions do not apply to any claim by Her 
       Majesty against the Contractor except any counterclaim in a dispute 
       as defined in this DR 01 Interpretation, including, but not limited 
       to, any claim of set off regarding any amount due to Her Majesty 
       under GC37 of the General Conditions.

<strong>DR 02  (13/12/02)    Consultation and Co-operation</strong>

2.1    The parties agree to maintain open and honest communication 
       throughout the performance of the contract.

2.2    The parties agree to consult and cooperate with each other in the 
       furtherance of the work and the resolution of problems or 
       differences which may arise.

<strong>DR 03  (13/12/02)    Authority of Engineer</strong>

3.1    Any difference between the parties to the contract of any nature 
       arising out of or in connection with the contract which could result 
       in a claim by the Contractor against Her Majesty, and which is not 
       settled by consultation and cooperation as envisaged in DR 02 
       Consultation and Co-
operation, shall be resolved in the first instance by the Engineer, whose 
written decision or direction shall be final and binding subject only to 
the provisions of these Dispute Resolution Conditions "G."  Such written 
decision or direction includes, but is not limited to, any written decision 
or direction by the Engineer under any provision of the General Conditions.

3.2    The Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted the decision or 
       direction of the Engineer referred to in DR 3.1 and to have 
       expressly waived and released Her Majesty from any claim in respect 
       of the particular matter dealt within that decision or direction 
       unless, within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of the 
       decision or direction, the Contractor submits to the Engineer a 
       written notice of dispute requesting formal negotiation under DR 04 
       Negotiation.  Such notice shall refer specifically to DR 04 
       Negotiation and shall specify the issues in contention and the 
       relevant provisions of the contract.

3.3    The giving of a written notice in accordance with DR 3.2 shall not 
       relieve the Contractor from complying with the decision or direction 
       that is the subject of the dispute.  Such compliance, however, shall 
       not be construed as an admission by the Contractor of the 
       correctness of such decision or direction. 

3.4    If a dispute is not resolved promptly, the Engineer shall give such 
       instructions as, in the Engineer's opinion, are necessary for the 
       proper performance of the work and to prevent delays pending a 
       resolution of the matter.  Unless the Minister terminates the 
       contract, orders the Contractor to suspend the work, or takes the 
       work out of the hands of the Contractor, the Contractor shall 
       continue to perform the work in accordance with the provisions and 
       requirements of the contract and the instructions of the Engineer.  
       Such performance shall not prejudice any claim that the Contractor 
       may have.

3.5    Nothing in these Dispute Resolution Conditions relieves the 
       Contractor from its obligation to provide any other notice required 
       by the Contract within the time specified in the Contract, including, 
       but not limited to, any notice required under GC35 of the General 
       Conditions.

4.1    Within ten (10) working days after receipt by the Engineer of a 
       notice referred to in DR 3.2, or within such other period of time as 
       may be mutually agreed to, the parties shall commence formal 
       negotiations in order to resolve the dispute.  Negotiations shall 
       occur initially between representatives of the Contractor and Her 
       Majesty who play a direct supervisory role in the performance or 
       management of the contract.

4.2    If the representatives referred to in DR 4.1 are unable to resolve 
       some or all of the issues which are the subject of the negotiations 
       within ten (10) working days, the parties shall refer the remaining 
       issues which are in dispute to a second level of negotiation between 
       a principal or principals of the Contractor and a senior level 
       manager or senior level managers representing Her Majesty.
 
4.3    If negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) 
       working days from the date of delivery of the notice referred to in 
       DR 3.2, or within such longer period as may have been agreed to by 
       the parties, the Contractor may, by giving written notice to the 
       Engineer, in accordance with GC11 of the General Conditions, within 
       ten (10) working days from the end of such period, request that 
       mediation be undertaken to assist the parties to reach agreement on 
       the outstanding issues.

4.4    If the Contractor does not request mediation within the period 
       permitted by DR 4.3, the Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted 
       the decision or direction of the Engineer under DR 3.1 and to have 
       expressly waived and released Her Majesty from any claim in respect 
       of the particular matter dealt within that decision or direction.

       mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the current issue of

       of construction contract disputes attached hereto as Dispute 
       Resolution  Rules for Mediation (Construction Contract).

5.2    If a Project Mediator has not previously been appointed for the 
       purposes of the contract, a Project Mediator shall be appointed in 
       accordance with Dispute Resolution  Rules for Mediation forthwith

       mediation.

5.3    If the dispute has not been resolved within 

       5.3.1  ten (10) working days following the appointment of a Project 
              Mediator in accordance with DR 5.2, if a Project Mediator was

       5.3.2  ten (10) working days following receipt by the Engineer of a 
              written notice in accordance with DR 4.3, if a Project 
              Mediator was previously appointed, or 

       5.3.3  such other longer period as may have been agreed to by the 
              parties, 

       the Project Mediator shall terminate the mediation by giving written 
       notice to the parties stating the effective date of termination.

       the Public Works and Government Services Canada rules for 
       arbitration of construction contract disputes attached hereto as
