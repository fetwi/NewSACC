<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Contractor represents and warrants that the Statement of Canadian 
Content attached to this Contract is accurate and complete, using the 
Definition of Canadian Content set out in that Statement.  The Contractor 
acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation and warranty 
to enter into this Contract.  Such representation and warranty of Canadian 
content may be verified in such manner as the Minister may reasonably 
require.

Should a verification by the Minister disclose that the Work does not 
contain the amount of Canadian content that is set out in the Statement of 
Canadian Content, Canada shall be paid, upon written request, the amount of $0.10 
for each dollar of shortfall.

Nothing in this clause shall be interpreted as limiting the rights and 
remedies which Canada or the Minister may otherwise have in relation to or 
pursuant to this Contract.

The Parties acknowledge that the actual damages which would be sustained by 
Canada in the event of such shortfall would be impracticable or extremely 
difficult to ascertain and the aforesaid amounts are stipulated to be fair 
estimates of such actual damages.

The Parties acknowledge that section 37 of the Federal Court Act, Revised 
Statutes of Canada (1985), Chapter F7 applies to this Contract.  Canada 
shall have the right to holdback, drawback, deduct and set off from and 
against the amount of any monies owning at any time by Canada to the 
Contractor any liquidated damages owing and unpaid under this clause; 
provided that in respect of any such holdback, deduction or set off the 
Minister shall provide a statement for such amount setting forth the amount 
and method of calculation.

In this clause, "shortfall" means the difference (measured in dollars) 
   between the amount of Canadian content in the Work as set out in the 
   Statement of Canadian Content and the amount of such content as 
   disclosed in a verification by the Minister where the amount disclosed 
   in the verification is less than the amount in the Statement.
