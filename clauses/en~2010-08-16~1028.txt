<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If any part of the Specifications provides for a
method of construction or for the supply and/or use of materials,
equipment or parts which are not specified with particularity, the
Contractor will have the right of selection provided that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the construction so performed and the materials,
equipment and parts so supplied and/or used are in accordance with
good marine building practice for the type and class of Vessels
covered by the Contract, and</li>
<li value="2">the Specifications and drawings and all other
Contract requirements are fully complied with.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Inspector is the final judge of the quality,
quantity and suitability of the workmanship, parts, materials,

purposes of the Work and as to the meaning or interpretation of the
Specifications. Its decision with regard to the foregoing matters,

production of the Work are not in accordance with the provisions of
the Contract. The Contractor must immediately at its own expense
replace or otherwise make good to the satisfaction of the Inspector
any part of the materials or Work which may have been rejected by
the Inspector. Canada will not be liable for any work done,
materials, or parts delivered or assembly made by the Contractor,
unless and until the same are approved by the Inspector as
evidenced by its certificate in writing.</p>
<h2 id="drawings-and-models-prepared-by-contractor">1028 05 (2010-08-16) Drawings &amp; Models Prepared by
Contractor</h2>

have been prepared by the Contractor pursuant to the Contract are
the sole property of Canada and may be used as Canada sees
fit.</li>
<li value="2">Approval of the drawings, whether express or implied,
does not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility under the
Contract to deliver a vessel that will meet the performance
requirements in the Specifications.</li>
<li value="3">Where modifications are requested to the drawings
before their approval, the Contractor will be deemed to have
accepted such modifications and to have agreed that they do not
constitute a change in Specifications and that they will not affect
the performance of the vessel adversely, unless it notifies Canada,
in writing, within fourteen (14) days after receipt by it or notice
of the modification, that it considers that such modification
constitutes a change in specification or that it will adversely
affect the performance of the Vessel. If the Contractor does not
withdraw such notice, it will be relieved of any liability for
failure of the Vessel to perform in accordance with the warranty
insofar as such failure can be shown to be the direct result of
such modification.</li>

modifications of, changes in or additions to the Specifications,
changes in methods of shipment or packing and in the place or time
of delivery. The Contractor must comply with all directions given
by Canada with respect of the foregoing. If any such suspension,
modification, change or addition result in an increase or decrease
in the Cost of the Work, the Contract Price will be adjusted
accordingly provided that the Contractor will in no event be
entitled to compensation for any loss of anticipated profits and
provided further that minor increases or decreases in cost will be
disregarded.</li>
<li value="2">Any adjustment to the Contract Price made pursuant to
paragraph 1 will be ascertained and agreed to by the Parties before
the purchase of any materials or the commencement of any work by
the Contractor.</li>
<li value="3">If the Contractor proposes to make a claim for
adjustment of the Contract Price pursuant to paragraph 1, it must
provide notice to Canada of its intention to do so within thirty
(30) days of the date that it received information that a change
within the scope of paragraph 1 has been made. Failure by the

change.</li>

may require from time to time at the Contractor's shipyard.</li>
