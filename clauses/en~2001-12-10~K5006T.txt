<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in which the 
special procedures under the CKTEA are applicable (see Supply Manual) and where 
competition is being conditionally limited to bids offering Canadian or Korean 
Goods and Services.  This clause is to be used for multi-item requirements that 
are being certified on an individual item basis and where the bidder is to list 
in the clause those items in its bid that are to be considered Canadian or 
Korean Goods and Services. 

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K5000D CKTEA Definitions.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is subject to a preference for Canadian and/or 
       Korean Goods and Services as defined in clause K5000D, CKTEA 
       Definitions.

2.     On an item-by-item basis, items that include this representation and 
       warranty will be given preference over other bids, if there are  two 
       or more bids with a valid certification.  Bids may be accepted in 
       whole or in part.

3.     The Bidder represents and warrants that, of the Goods and Services 
       being offered, the following items are Canadian or Korean Goods or 
       Services as defined in clause K5000D, CKTEA Definitions:

       ____________________

       ____________________

       ____________________

       ____________________

       ____________________

       ____________________

       ____________________

4.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this bid. Such representation and warranty 
       of Canadian and/or Korean content may be verified in such manner as 
       the Minister may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       covenant, the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract 
       resulting from this bid as being in default.

6.     If a Bidder is unable to verify the origin of Goods or Services 
       offered in the bid, then the bid will be considered non-responsive.

7.     Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph and to include it with 
       the bid will result in all Goods and Services offered being treated 
       as non-Canadian and non-Korean.
