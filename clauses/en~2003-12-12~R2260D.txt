<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><strong>GC 6.1 Changes in the Work</strong>

1.     The Minister, or the Departmental Representative under the authority 
       of the Minister, shall have the right to order additional Work, 
       dispense with, or change the whole or any part of the Work described 
       in the Plans and Specifications or Scope of the Work.

2.     The Departmental  Representative shall decide whether anything done 
       or not done as a result of directions given under subsection 1 of GC 
       6.1 has increased or decreased the cost of the Work to the 
       Contractor and where the cost of the Work has increased or decreased, 
       the amount payable under the Contract shall be increased or 
       decreased by an amount calculated in accordance with GC5.9.

3.     Any change in the terms of the Contract, other than changes that may 
       be ordered by the Minister or the Departmental Representative 
       pursuant to subsection 1 of GC 6.1, may be made only by agreement in 
       writing between Canada and the Contractor.

<strong>GC 6.2 Changes in Subsurface Conditions</strong> <strong>and Delays by Canada</strong>

1.     No extra payment shall be made to the Contractor for any extra 
       expense, loss or damage for any reason unless the Minister or the 
       Departmental Representative under the authority of the Minister 
       shall certify that such extra expense, loss or damage is directly 
       attributable to

       (a)    a substantial difference between the subsurface conditions as 
              indicated in the Plans and Specifications or Scope of Work 
              and the actual conditions found at the site of the Work; or

       (b)    the neglect or delay by Canada, occurring after the date of 
award of the Contract,

              (i)    in providing any information or the doing of any act 
                     which Canada is required expressly by the Contract to 
                     do or as required by a known custom of the trade; or

              (ii)   in suspending the Work pursuant to GC 7.3.

2.     The Contractor shall, within ten (10) days immediately after 
       encountering such subsurface conditions or such neglect or delay, 
       give written notice to the Departmental Representative of a claim 
       for such extra expense, loss or damage.  Failure to provide such 
       written notice shall render the claim null and void.

3.     The amount of any extra payment made under this section shall be 
       calculated in accordance with GC 5.9.

4.     If, in the opinion of the Departmental Representative, any 
       difference in subsurface conditions referred to in subsection 1 of 
       GC 6.2 results in a savings to the Contractor, the amount of said 
       savings shall be deducted from the Contract Amount owing to the 
       Contractor.

<strong>GC 6.3 Extension of Time</strong><span class="wsStyleUnderline"></span>

1.     Upon written application by the Contractor made before the date 
       fixed for the completion of the Work, the Departmental 
       Representative under the authority of the Minister, may extend the 
       time for completion of the Work if, in the opinion of the 
       Departmental Representative, causes beyond the control of the 
       Contractor have delayed its completion.

2.     If the Contractor does not complete the Work by the day fixed for 
       its completion, but completes it thereafter, the Contractor shall

       (a)    pay all Canada's inspection costs relating to the Work 
              incurred after the stipulated completion date; and

       (b)    compensate Canada for any loss or damage resulting from the 
              failure by the Contractor to complete the Work by the 
              completion date fixed by the Contract.
