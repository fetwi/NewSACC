</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Contractor and any of his subcontractors shall ensure that all test 
facilities used for Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) compliance testing 
are recognized by DND as having the necessary specific capabilities. They 
shall further ensure that all facilities in the United States to be used 
for EMC compliance testing are recognized under the National Voluntary 
Accreditation program (NVLAP) as having the necessary specific capabilities.  

Facilities other than Canadian and U.S. must be recognized under an 
equivalent certification program that is acceptable to DND.  Contractors 
and subcontractors with test facilities not recognized, but used to perform 
EMC compliance testing, shall take action to have their capabilities 
reviewed prior to commencement of any EMC compliance testing and the 
facility must be acceptable to the DND Quality Assurance Authority.  

Testing will be witnessed by government personnel when judged necessary by 
the DND Quality Assurance Authority or his/her delegated representative.  
This requirement is in addition to any other quality assurance clauses.  

Where the necessary and specific capabilities for EMC compliance testing 
are found lacking, no further testing shall proceed until such time as the 
Contractor rectifies the situation to the satisfaction of the DND Quality 
Assurance Authority or his/her delegated representative.
