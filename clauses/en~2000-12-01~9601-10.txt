engaged as an employee, servant or agent of <em>Canada</em>.


<strong>9601-10       03     (01/12/92)    Amendments and Waivers</strong>

No amendment to the <em>Contract</em> shall be effective unless it is incorporated 
into the <em>Contract</em> by written amendment executed by the authorized 
representatives of the <em>Minister</em> and of the <em>Contractor</em>.  No waiver shall be 
valid, binding or affect the rights of the Parties unless it is made in 
writing by, in the case of a waiver by <em>Canada</em>, the authorized 
representative of <em>Canada</em> and, in the case of a waiver by the <em>Contractor</em>, 
the authorized representative of the <em>Contractor</em>.  The waiver by a <em>Party</em> of 
a breach of any term or condition of the <em>Contract</em> shall not prevent the 
enforcement of that term or condition by that <em>Party</em> in the case of a 
subsequent breach, and shall not be deemed or construed a waiver of any 
subsequent breach.

       (b)    it has the necessary qualifications, including knowledge and 
              skill, to perform the <em>Work</em>, together with the ability to use

       any purported assignment made without that consent is void and of no 
       effect.

2.     No assignment of the <em>Contract</em> shall relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from any 
       obligation under the <em>Contract</em> or impose any liability upon <em>Canada</em> or 
       the <em>Minister</em>, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the <em>Minister</em>.


<strong>9601-10       07     (01/12/92)    Time of the Essence</strong>

In the event of any delay in performance of the <em>Work</em> due to force majeure, 
the time for performance shall be extended for a period equivalent to the 
time lost by reason of the force majeure, provided, however, that the <em>
Contractor</em> has advised the <em>Minister</em> of the event of force majeure as soon 
as the <em>Contractor</em> has become aware of it, and provided further that, in the 
event that the period of force majeure exceeds 30 days, the <em>Minister</em> may, 
by giving written notice to the <em>Contractor</em>, terminate the <em>Contract</em>, at no 
cost to <em>Canada</em>, as regards all or any part of the <em>Work</em> not completed. If a

shall be refunded to the <em>Minister</em> upon written demand therefor. In this 
section, "force majeure" means fire, flood, riots, acts of the enemy, acts

              establishes to the satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> that such 
              parts of the <em>Work</em> will be free from all claims, liens, 
              attachments, charges or encumbrances; and 

       (d)    in the case of payment in respect of finished work, the 
              finished work has been inspected by <em>Canada</em> and accepted as 
              being in accordance with the <em>Contract</em>, including the <em>
              Specifications</em>.

2.     The <em>Minister</em> shall notify the <em>Contractor</em>, within 15 days of receipt 
       of an invoice, of any inadequacy of the invoice or of the supporting 
       documentation, and where any such notice is given within that period 
       the date for payment of the amount invoiced shall be postponed until 
       the <em>Contractor</em> remedies the inadequacy to the satisfaction of the <em>
       Minister</em>.

       interest established from time to time by the Bank of Canada as the

       by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an 
       amount <em>due and payable</em>;

       an amount is "<em>due and payable</em>" when it is due and payable by <em>Canada</em> 
       to the <em>Contractor</em> in accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em>; and

       an amount becomes "<em>overdue</em>" when it is unpaid on the first day

       that is imposed under sales or excise tax legislation of the 
       Government of Canada and which affects the <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em> of 
       the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Contract Price</em> shall be adjusted to reflect the 
       increase or decrease in the <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     There shall be no adjustment under subsection 2 in respect of any 
       change that would increase the <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em> of the Work if 
       public notice of the change was given before the <em>bid</em> submission date

       effect on its <em>Cost</em> before that date.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall forward to the <em>Minister</em> a certified statement 
       showing the increase or decrease in <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em> that is

       caused by the <em>Contractor</em> or any Subcontractor after such delivery.

4.     Any vesting of title referred to in subsection 2 shall not 
       constitute acceptance by <em>Canada</em> of the materials, parts,

       Contractor</em> of its obligation to perform the <em>Work</em> in accordance with 
       the <em>Contract</em>.

       Contract</em>, or such lesser cost as may be required to transport the 
       Work or part thereof to another location directed by the Technical

       is made against the <em>Contractor</em>, or an order is made or a resolution 
       passed for the winding up of the <em>Contractor</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may, upon

       by <em>Canada</em> and for all losses and damages which may be suffered by <em>
       Canada</em> by reason of the default or occurrence upon which the notice 
       was based, including any increase in the cost incurred by <em>Canada</em> in 
       procuring the <em>Work</em> from another source.  Nothing in this section

2.     In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to 
       subsection 1, the <em>Contractor</em> shall be entitled to be paid, to the 
       extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for 
       purposes of performing the <em>Contract</em> and to the extent that the <em>
       Contractor</em> has not already been so paid or reimbursed by <em>Canada</em>:

       (a)    on the basis of the <em>Contract Price</em>, for all completed work 
              that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the <em>
              Contract</em>, whether completed before, or after and in 
              compliance with the instructions contained in the termination 
              notice;

              payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer 
              required by reason of the termination except wages that the <em>
              Contractor</em> is obligated by statute to pay them and except for 
              reasonable severance payments or damages paid to employees 
              hired to perform the <em>Contract</em> whose hiring was expressly 
              required by the <em>Contract</em> or approved in writing by the <em>
              Minister</em> for the purpose of the <em>Contract</em>.

3.     The <em>Minister</em> may reduce the payment in respect of any of the <em>Work</em> to 
       the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in meeting the 
       requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.

4.     Notwithstanding anything in subsection 2, the total of the amounts 
       to which the <em>Contractor</em> is entitled under paragraphs 2(a) and (b), 
       together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to the <em>
       Contractor</em> under other provisions of the <em>Contract</em>, shall not exceed 
       the <em>Contract Price</em> or the portion thereof that is applicable to the 
       part of the <em>Work</em> that is terminated.

5.     In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the <em>Contract</em> and in the subcontracting of any of the <em>Work</em>, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall, unless otherwise authorized by the <em>Minister</em>, place 
       purchase orders and subcontracts on terms that will enable the <em>
       Contractor</em> to terminate the same upon terms and conditions similar 
       in effect to those provided in this section, and generally, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall co-operate with the <em>Minister</em> and do everything 
       reasonably within its power at all times to minimize the amount of <em>
       Canada</em>'s obligations in the event of a termination under this 
       section.

6.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of, or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of, any action taken or termination notice 
       given by the <em>Minister</em> under this section, except to the extent that
