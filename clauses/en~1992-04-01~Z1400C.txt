<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<p><abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may at any time, by a written order, and without notice to
the sureties, make changes, within the general scope of this
Contract, in any one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">drawings, designs, or specifications, where the
supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government in accordance therewith;</li>
<li value="2">method of shipment or packing; and</li>
<li value="3">place of delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the costs
of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the
Work under this Contract, whether changed or not changed by any
such order, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the Contract
Price or delivery schedule, or both, and the Contract shall be
modified in writing accordingly. Any claim by the Contractor for
adjustment under this clause must be asserted within twenty (20)
days from the date of receipt by the Contractor of the notification
of change, provided, however, that <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, if it decides that the
facts justify such action, may receive and act upon any such claim
asserted at any time prior to final payment under this Contract.
Where the cost of property made obsolete or excess as a result of a
change is included in the Contractor's claim for adjustment, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>
shall have the right to prescribe the manner of disposition of such
property. Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute
concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause of
this Contract entitled "Disputes". However, nothing in this clause
shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the Contract as
changed.</p>
