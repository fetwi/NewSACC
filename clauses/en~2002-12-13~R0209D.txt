5.1    No later than ten (10) working days following the date of

       Coordinator shall assemble and provide the parties with a list of 
       qualified private sector arbitrators obtained from an independent 
       and impartial entity, together with instructions to each party to 
       individually and confidentially select and rank their preferred and 
       fully acceptable choices of arbitrator in descending order.

5.2    Within ten (10) working days of receipt of the list referred to in 
       RA 5.1, each party shall comply with the instructions accompanying 
       the list(s) and shall deliver the completed listing to the 
       Coordinator.

5.3    Within two (2) working days following receipt of the completed 
       listings, the Coordinator shall select the highest common ranked 
       arbitrator to act as the Tribunal for the purposes of the 
       arbitration. 

5.4    In the event of a tie, the Coordinator shall consult both parties to 
       re-evaluate their rankings in order to assist the Coordinator in 
       selecting a single arbitrator acceptable to both parties.   If the 
       parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, the Coordinator shall 
       forthwith provide the parties with a second list of arbitrators and 
       the procedure shall be repeated. 

5.5    In the event that, following the repeated procedure, the Coordinator 
       again fails to select a single arbitrator acceptable to both parties,

       appointed by each of the parties and the third arbitrator appointed 
       by these two (2) arbitrators. 

5.6    The Tribunal shall in any event be composed of a person or persons 
       who have experience in the subject matter of the dispute and are 
       independent of either party.  Without limiting the generality of the 
       foregoing, the Tribunal shall be at arm's length from both parties 
       and shall not be composed of members of any company, firm, or agency 
       which advises either party, nor shall the Tribunal be composed of a 
       person or persons who are otherwise regularly retained by such 
       parties.

5.7    The parties agree that they shall jointly enter into an agreement 
       with the selected Tribunal, which agreement shall be in a form 
       drafted by the Coordinator and agreed to by the parties.

5.8    The parties agree that they shall each bear their own costs.  Fees
