If any part of the specifications provides for a method of construction or

requirements are fully complied with. Subject to the foregoing, the

Majesty within thirty (30) days thereafter for any such assessments, taxes,

<strong>1029   08     (06/91)       Where Vessel Remains in Commission</strong>


If the vessel is to remain in commission while the work is being carried 
out, then 

       (a) the work shall be carried out on the vessel at such place as the 
       vessel is from time to time berthed, provided that every endeavour 
       shall be made consistent with the necessity for speedy execution of 
       the work to have the vessel berthed at such place as will facilitate 
       the work required to be performed thereon by the Contractor;

       (b) the Contractor shall not be in charge of or responsible for the 
       care and protection of the vessel but shall be liable for all loss 
       or damage or personal injury (to persons other than those in the 
       employ of the Contractor) resulting from any negligent or wrongful 
       act or omission on the part of the Contractor, its officers, 
       servants, agents or employees during the carrying out of the work.  
       If any such loss or damage should occur to the vessel or to the work, 
       the Contractor shall forthwith, unless otherwise directed by the 
       Minister or the Inspector and subject to such conditions as the

       restore and/or replace the vessel and/or the work so lost or 
       destroyed.  The Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Her 
       Majesty and the Minister against and from all loss, damages, costs 
       and expenses arising from or in any way connected with any and all

       occasioned as aforesaid.  

<strong>1029   09     (06/91)       Where Vessel out of Commission</strong>

       ground the vessel, it shall be berthed where it will not touch the 
       ground at either high or low water;

       (b) the Contractor shall be in charge of and be entirely responsible 
       for the care and efficient protection of the vessel from the time of 
       delivery thereof to the Contractor until redelivered to and accepted

       Inspector and thereafter acknowledge receipt of the items set forth 
       therein; upon completion of the work, if such items are accounted 
       for to the satisfaction of the Inspector, a clearance will be given 
       to the Contractor;

       (d) the Contractor shall provide the necessary warehouse or storage 
       accommodation for and maintain in good conditions, lubricated, 
       painted and protected from the weather, all equipment, fittings, 
       articles or things temporarily removed from the vessel during the 
       work or which may be supplied to the Contractor by Her Majesty for 
       stowing or fitting in place on board the vessel prior to delivery 
       thereof to Her Majesty, and shall redeliver the same to Her Majesty 
       in as good condition as when so removed by or supplied to the 
       Contractor.  The Contractor shall also provide safe storage 
       accommodation for any part or parts of the vessel permanently 
       removed until the same are disposed of as hereinbefore provided;

       (e) the Contractor shall take the usual and proper precautions to

       fittings, stores or things left in the vessel which might become 
       damaged by exposure;

       (f) if the work hereunder necessitates the removal of stores and no 
       secure place of stowage is available on board the vessel, the 
       Contractor shall provide the necessary labour for removal and a 
       secure place for storage.  The Contractor shall furnish receipts for 
       such stores.  The Contractor undertakes that such stores shall be 
       well and carefully stored and not mingled with property of a similar 
       nature;

       (g) the Contractor shall be liable for all loss or damage of or to 
       the vessel or the work and for personal injury (to persons other 
       than those in the employ of the Contractor) resulting from any 
       negligent or wrongful act or omission on the part of the Contractor, 
       its officers, servants, agents or employees from the time of the 
       taking over of the vessel until delivery of the vessel and final 
       acceptance of the work pursuant to the provisions hereof.  If any 
       such loss or damage should occur prior to such delivery and final 
       acceptance, the Contractor shall forthwith (unless otherwise 
       directed by the Minister or the Inspector and subject to such 
       conditions as the Minister or the Inspector may impose), at its own 
       expense, repair, restore and/or replace the vessel and/or the work 
       so lost or damaged. Neither Her Majesty nor the Minister shall be in 
       any manner responsible or liable for any loss or damage which shall 
       or may happen to the vessel and/or the work, or any part or parts 
       thereof (prior to delivery as herein provided), or for any injury 
       including injuries resulting in death, to any person or persons, or

       connection with the vessel, or caused by or resulting from or in any 
       way arising out of the work, and the Contractor shall indemnify and 
       save harmless Her Majesty and the Minister against and from all loss, 
       costs, damages and expenses arising from or in any way connected 
       with any and all claims for or in respect of such loss, damages or 
       injuries.  

<strong>1029   10     (06/91)       Insurance</strong>

out of the contract; and the Contractor further agrees that, in the event 
of any loss or liability covered by the said insurance being suffered or 
incurred by or in relation to the vessel or to the work, the said insurance

may appear.  

<strong>1029   11     (06/91)       Public Ceremony</strong><strong></strong>

(1) The security (if any) referred to in the agreement shall be held and 
retained by Her Majesty as security for the due and complete performance, 
observance and fulfilment by the Contractor of all the covenants and 
provisions of the contract.  Unless and until the security is forfeited to 
Her Majesty as herein provided, Her Majesty shall remit any revenues and 
income therefrom (provided that Her Majesty shall in no event be obligated 
to invest moneys as interest or otherwise) to the Contractor, and in the 
case of interest coupons, or dividend coupons payable to bearer, shall 
deliver the same to the Contractor as and when they mature.  In the event 
of any default by the Contractor in fulfilment of any of the terms and 
conditions of the contract, the security shall (without prejudice to any 
and all other rights and recourses accruing to Her Majesty) be forfeited to 
and retained by Her Majesty as liquidated damages and not as a penalty but, 
if the Contractor shall have duly performed, observed and fulfilled all the 
covenants, terms and conditions of the contract, the security shall be 
returned to the Contractor.  

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Minister may, at his discretion, 
authorize a return of the security to the Contractor at any time before the 
Contractor has fulfilled all its obligations under the contract.  In such 
event, the return of the security shall not prejudice any rights or 
recourse accruing to Her Majesty under the contract.
