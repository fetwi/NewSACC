       performed the Services as determined by the Departmental 
       Representative.  Payment in respect of a Service, or part of a 
       Service, is not to be deemed a waiver of Canada's rights of set-off

<strong>GC 5.2 (30/05/03)    Fee Arrangement(s) for Services</strong>

1.     The fee to be paid to the Consultant for the Services described 
       herein, shall be determined by one or more of the following 
       arrangements as specified in the Agreement Particulars:

       (a)    Percentage Fee

              The calculation of the total fee recognizes the variability 
              of the Construction Cost Estimate as the Project develops.  
              The fee for the various Services of the Project development 
              shall be calculated on the basis of the following formula:

              An amount equal to F x A
              Where F = the percentage specified in the Agreement 
              Particulars, and A = as follows:

              (i)    At Analysis of Project Requirements and Design Concept: 
                     A = the Construction Cost Estimate at the time of 
                     signing the Agreement.

              (ii)   At Design Development:
                     A = the accepted preliminary Construction Cost 
                     Estimate prepared on completion of the design concept 
                     documents.

              (iii)  At Construction Documents:
                     A = the accepted updated Construction Cost Estimate 
                     prepared on completion of the design development 
                     documents.

              (iv)   At Tender Call and Tender Evaluation:
                     A = the accepted final Construction Cost Estimate 
                     prepared on completion of the construction documents.

              (v)    At Construction and Contract Administration and Post 
                     Construction Warranty Review:
                     A = the Construction Contract Award Price.

              The total fee is adjusted in accordance with the terms of any 
              authorization pursuant to GC 5.8.

       (b)    Fixed Fee

              The fixed fee may be in the form of a fixed lump sum or an 
              amount made up of fixed unit prices multiplied by a number of 
              units of deliverables in the amount(s) specified in the 
              Agreement Particulars. 
       (c)    Time Based Fee

              (i)    Principals and executives, and other personnel 
                     approved in that capacity by the Departmental 
                     Representative shall be paid at the hourly rate 
                     specified in the Agreement Particulars.

              (ii)   Staff approved by the Departmental Representative 
                     shall be paid at Payroll Cost multiplied by the 
                     factor(s) specified in the Agreement Particulars, 
                     except that the multiplying factor shall not be 
                     applied to the premium portion of authorized overtime 
                     included in Payroll Cost.

              (iii)  Normal Working Hours
                     The normal working hours per day for principals, 
                     executives and Consultant's employees, shall be deemed 
                     to be seven and a half (7.5) hours of any day during 
                     which they are actually engaged in the performance of 
                     the Services.

              (iv)   Travel Time
                     Travel time during normal working hours, that is 
                     related to the Project and authorized by the 
                     Departmental Representative, shall be chargeable as 
                     time worked.

                     Travel time outside normal working hours, that is 
                     related to the Project and authorized by the 
                     Departmental Representative, shall be chargeable up to 
                     a maximum of three (3) hours per day, unless otherwise 
                     authorized.

              (v)    Maximum Amount(s) Payable
                     The maximum amount(s) that applies (apply) to the 
                     Services to be carried out at time rates shall be as

       and payable to the Consultant directly to the claimant 
       Sub-Consultant.

2.     For the purposes of subsection 1 a claim shall be considered lawful

              Representative and signed by the Consultant authorizing 
              payment of the said claim or claims.

3.     A payment made pursuant to subsection 1 is, to the extent of the 
       payment, a discharge of Canada's liability to the Consultant under 
       the Agreement and will be deducted from any amount payable to the 
       Consultant under the Agreement.

              (i)    should have been paid in full under the claimant's 
                     Agreement with the Consultant where the claim is for 
                     an amount that was lawfully required to be held back 
                     from the claimant; or

              (ii)   performed the last of the Services pursuant to the 
                     claimant's Agreement with the Consultant where the 
                     claim is not for an amount referred to in 
                     sub-paragraph 4.(a)(i), and 

       (b)    the proceedings to determine the right to payment of which 
              shall have commenced within one year from the date that the 
              notification referred to in paragraph 4.(a) was received by 
              the Departmental Representative.

5.     Canada may, upon receipt of a notification of claim referred to in

       claim or any portion thereof.

6.     The Departmental Representative shall notify the Consultant in 
       writing of receipt of any notification of claim and of the intention 
       of Canada to withhold funds pursuant to subsection 5.  The 
       Consultant may, at any time thereafter and until payment is made to 
       the claimant, post with Canada, security in a form acceptable to 
       Canada in an amount equal to the value of the said claim.  Upon 
       receipt of such security Canada shall release to the Consultant any 
       funds which would be otherwise payable to the Consultant, that were 
       withheld pursuant to the provision of subsection 5.

7.     The Consultant shall discharge all lawful obligations and shall 
       satisfy all lawful claims against the Consultant for Services 
       rendered to, or on behalf of, the Consultant in respect of the 
       Agreement at least as often as the Agreement requires Canada to 
       discharge its obligations to the Consultant.

       mutually agreed upon from time to time, subject to these Terms of 
       Payment and the approval of the Minister.

       as applicable for any of those persons for whom the relevant

       (c)    any fee adjustment for Services resulting from an adjustment 
              in the Construction Cost Estimate arising from the additional 
              Services is not commensurate with the additional Services 
              performed.

<strong>GC 5.9 (30/05/03)    Extension of Time</strong>

If, and to the extent that, the time for completion of the Construction
