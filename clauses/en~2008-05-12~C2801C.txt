<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in Canadian defence contracts awarded to Canadian 
contractors who may obtain material from United States (U.S.) suppliers, for the 
provision of goods to be used directly in Canadian defence activities.

Note:	A threshold of US$50,000 is included in the U.S. Defence Priorities and 
Allocations System regulations (15 CFR Part 700.17) where it is stated that for 
contracts under this value, a priority rating is not required, "provided that 
delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority 
rating."

Contracting officers must consult the Supply Manual, procedures 6B.195, 6B.196 
and 7A.140 for more information on the application of a priority rating.</pre>

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contract concerns a Canadian defence requirement and therefore 
       is eligible to be assigned a "U.S. Priority Rating" for any 
       materials/services imported from the United States which may be 
       required in the performance of the Work.  Accordingly, the 
       Contractor must:

       (a)    make an application to the Defence Priorities and Allocations 
              Officer, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), 
              either by e-mail at: NCR.ACQBDefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca; 
              or by facsimile: 819-956-1459; and

       (b)    include this clause in subcontracts with Canadian contractors, 
              and quote the PWGSC Contract Number indicated in the Contract.

2.     Failure to comply with the above may impact on the Contractor's 
       delivery commitments.  Therefore, the Contractor is responsible for 
       any breach of the Contract that arises from such a failure.
