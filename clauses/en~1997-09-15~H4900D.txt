<pre>1.     Payment by Canada to the Contractor for the Work shall be made:

       (a)    in the case of a progress payment other than the final 
              payment, within thirty (30) days following the date of 
              receipt of a duly completed "Claim for Progress Payment", 
              form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111;

       (b)    in the case of a final payment, within thirty (30) days 
              following the date of receipt of a duly completed final "
              Claim for Progress Payment", form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111, or within 
              thirty (30) days following the date on which the Work is 
              completed,

              whichever date is the later. 

2.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the progress claim, 
       within fifteen (15) days of its receipt, Canada shall notify the 
       Contractor of the nature of the objection. "Form of the claim" means 
       a claim which contains or is accompanied by such substantiating 
       documentation as Canada requires. Failure by Canada to act within 
       fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified in 
       subsections 1(a) and (b) of the clause to apply for the sole purpose 
       of calculating interest on overdue accounts.
