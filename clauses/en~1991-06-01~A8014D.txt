<pre>The Minister may opt to extend the Rental Contract for a period of up to 
ninety (90) days by giving notice to the Supplier prior to contract 
expiration.  

In such event, the Customer shall pay the then current Rental charges on 
   the basis of the equipment being rented on a thirty (30) day 
   cancellation plan. In the event there is no thirty (30) day cancellation 
   plan rate for the equipment, the Supplier shall substitute the most 
   similar annual price plan monthly rate. If the equipment has not been 
   recontracted during this ninety (90) day period, the equipment is to be 
   removed.
