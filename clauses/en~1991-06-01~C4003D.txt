performance of the work, then the supplier will be reimbursed for actual 
costs incurred with respect to travel and living expenses not exceeding the 
applicable allowances listed in the current Treasury Board Travel Directive.

In no event shall the supplier add to these expenses an element to cover 
   profit or general and administrative charges.
