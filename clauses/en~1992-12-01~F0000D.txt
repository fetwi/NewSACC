<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>The clauses in this subsection are to be considered as a guide since each 
contractual requirement may necessitate minor refinements to the most suitable 
sample clause. In the event that the wording of a clause is altered in any way, 
the procurement officer is directed to delete the clause number and date.  
Procurements which contain SECURITY REQUIREMENTS are required to be processed 
through, and the security aspects of the contract documentation approved by the 
Industrial Security Division of the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services BEFORE the release of the solicitation or award of contract or standing 
offer. (Supply Manual, procedure 3.009).

Procurement officers are to be guided by the Security Requirements Check List 
(SRCL) form TBS/SCT 350-103, a sample copy of which may be found at Section 2, 
Annex A.
