<p>Subject to the following paragraph, Canada will be responsible
for the cost of surcharges applied by the carrier for the shipping
of individual items weighing more than 30 kilograms or measuring
more than 150 centimeters, including packaging.</p>
<p>Before shipping an order, the Contractor must notify the
Identified User in writing of the cost of any applicable surcharge.
The Contractor must, if requested, provide supporting documentation
to the Identified User. The Identified User may, within 24 hours of
written notification of the surcharge, cancel its order in whole or
