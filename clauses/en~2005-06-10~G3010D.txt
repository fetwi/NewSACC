<pre>While the government property is under the care, custody or control of the 
Contractor including during transit, All Risks Property in Transit insurance is 
required to cover any loss or damage to government property.  The nature of the 
property involved would determine the type of property insurance policy (e.g. 
"All Risks" premises/plant, in transit, equipment floater, or 
construction/installation insurance) that should be purchased by the Contractor.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of $250,000 per shipment is too high or not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and Public Works and 
Government Services Canada's Risk Management and Insurance Advisory Services, at 
NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca.

The value and basis of valuation of government property must be filled in the 
clause.  The basis of valuation of this property should be established with the 
client and mentioned in the Contractor's insurance policy.

Insert in the blank of paragraph 1 one of the following: "Replacement Cost 
(new)"; "Actual Cash Value (depreciated cost)", or "Agreed Value (appraisal)".
