<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1. The Contractor shall not operate a domestic service or an international 
service unless, for every incident related to the operation of that service, 
it has;   a) liability insurance covering risks of injury to or death of 
passengers in an amount that is not less than the amount determined by 
multiplying $300,000 by the number of passenger seats on board the aircraft 
engaged in the service; and

       b) insurance covering risks of public liability in an amount that is 
       not less than:

              (i) $1,000,000, where the MCTOW of the aircraft engaged in 
              the service is not greater than 7,500 pounds,

              (ii) $2,000,000, where the MCTOW of the aircraft engaged in 
              the service is greater than 7,500 pounds but not greater than 
              18,000 pounds, and

              (iii) where the MCTOW of the aircraft engaged in the service 
              is greater than 18,000 pounds, $2,000,000 plus an amount 
              determined by multiplying $150 by the number of pounds by 
              which the MCTOW of the aircraft exceeds 18,000 pounds.

2. The insurance coverage required by paragraph a) need not extend to any 
passenger who is an employee of the Contractor if workers' compensation 
legislation governing a claim for damages against that Contractor by the 
employee is applicable.

3. No Contractor shall take out liability insurance to comply with 
subsection (1) that contains an exclusion or waiver provision reducing 
insurance coverage for any incident below the applicable minima determined 
pursuant to that subsection, unless that provision:

       a) consists of standard exclusion clauses adopted by the 
       international aviation insurance industry dealing with:

              (i) war, hijacking and other perils,

              (ii) noise and pollution and other perils, or

              (iii) aviation radioactive contamination;   

       b) is in respect of chemical drift;   

       c) is to the effect that the insurance does not apply to liability 
       assumed by the Contractor under any contract or agreement unless 
       such liability would have attached to the air carrier even in the 
       absence of such contract or agreement; or

       d) is to the effect that the entire policy shall be void if the 
       Contractor has concealed or misrepresented any material fact or 
       circumstance concerning the insurance or the subject thereof or if 
       there has been any fraud, attempted fraud or false statement by the 
       Contractor touching any matter relating to the insurance or the 
       subject thereof, whether before or after a loss.

4. The Contractor may have a comprehensive single limit liability coverage 
where liability risks are covered by a single policy or a combination of 
primary and excess policies, but no single limit liability coverage of that 
Contractor shall be for an amount that is less than the applicable combined 
insurance minima determined pursuant to paragraphs 1. a) and 1. b).

5. Such insurance is to be effected in the joint names of Her Majesty and 
the Contractor, together with the inclusion of the Cross Liability Clause.

6. In the event that additional premiums are incurred by a Contractor to 
comply with the Cross Liability provisions above, the inclusion of the 
following Severability of Interests Clause will be acceptable:

"The insurance afforded applies separately to each insured against whom the 
claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limit of the 
insurer's liability".

7. Her Majesty shall not be liable for the loss of, or damage to, the 
Contractor's equipment or property or any part thereof, except to the 
extent caused by or due to Her Majesty.

8. The foregoing provisions shall not limit the insurance coverage required 
by municipal, provincial or federal law.

9. The selected Contractor will provide Her Majesty with a certificate of 
insurance from the insurer, stating that the required insurance is in 
effect, that Her Majesty has been named as an additional insured with the 
Cross Liability Clause or the required Severability of Interests Clause to 
apply, and that the Department of Supply and Services will be given at 
least 15 days prior written notice of any policy cancellation or of any 
change in the amount of coverage or type of insurance specified.

10. The following clause shall be inserted in the Liability Insurance 
Policy and the Insurance Certificate.

Where any suit is instituted against Her Majesty which the Insurer would, 
but for this clause, have the right to defend on behalf of Her Majesty as a 
co-insured under this Contract for insurance, the Insured shall promptly 
contact the Attorney General of Canada for instructions by sending written 
notice to:

The Director, Civil Litigation Department of Justice Kent and Wellington 
Streets Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0H8
