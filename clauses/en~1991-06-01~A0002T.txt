<pre>The Bidder shall clearly indicate in the proposal either of the following:

       (a)  the type and amount of recoupment charges payable to the U.S. 
       Department of Defense by the Bidder or its U.S. subcontractors with 
       subcontracts over C$500,000; or

       (b)  that recoupment charges do not apply.

As Canada may be eligible to receive a waiver of such charges, and as U.S. 
   legislation precludes application for a waiver following contract award, 
   failure to identify such charges in the proposal may result in a 
   significant loss of savings to Canada.  Canada will therefore not be 
   held responsible for paying such charges if the information has not been 
   provided.
