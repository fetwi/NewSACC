<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in contracts when a proposed contractor has started the 
work, at its own risk, without the authorization of a government official before 
contract approval, and the work has not been completed. The contract will 
specify the amount that will be paid for the work performed before contract 
award and include a basis of payment for the period from the contract date to 
contract completion.

Contracting officers must include the applicable basis of payment in the 
contract, e.g. include C0206C for a limitation of expenditure contract or C1200C 
for a ceiling price contract.

Use this clause in conjunction with A9094C and C6000C.  Clause C6000C applies 
only to the firm price portion of the work.</pre>
