<h2 id="2022-01-282010Bsubcontracts">2010B 06 (2013-06-27) Subcontracts</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contractor may subcontract the supply of goods or services that are customarily subcontracted by the Contractor. In any other instance, the Contractor must obtain the prior consent in writing of the Contracting Authority. The Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to provide such particulars of the proposed subcontract as he considers necessary.</li>
<li>Subcontracting does not relieve the Contractor from any of its obligations under the Contract or impose any liability upon Canada to a subcontractor.</li>
<li>In any subcontract, the Contractor agrees to bind the subcontractor by the same conditions by which the Contractor is bound under the Contract, unless the Contracting Authority requires or agrees otherwise, with the exception of requirements under the Federal Contractors Program for employment equity which only apply to the Contractor.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Btime-of-the-essence">2010B 07 (2008-05-12) Time of the essence</h2>
<p>It is essential that the Work be performed within or at the time stated in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Bexcusable-delay">2010B 08 (2014-09-25) Excusable delay</h2>
<ol>
<li>A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any obligation under the Contract that is caused by an event that:
            <ol type="a">
<li>is beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor;</li>
<li>could not reasonably have been foreseen;</li>
<li>could not reasonably have been prevented by means reasonably available to the Contractor; and</li>
<li>occurred without the fault or neglect of the Contractor,</li>
</ol>
<p>will be considered an "Excusable Delay" if the Contractor advises the Contracting Authority of the occurrence of the delay or of the likelihood of the delay as soon as the Contractor becomes aware of it. The Contractor must also advise the Contracting Authority, within 15 working days, of all the circumstances relating to the delay and provide to the Contracting Authority for approval a clear work around plan explaining in detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.</p>
</li>
<li>Any delivery date or other date that is directly affected by an Excusable Delay will be postponed for a reasonable time that will not exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</li>
<li>However, if an Excusable Delay has continued for 30 days or more, the Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the Contract. In such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other loss arising out of the termination or the event that contributed to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</li>
<li>Unless Canada has caused the delay by failing to meet an obligation under the Contract, Canada will not be responsible for any costs incurred by the Contractor or any of its subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Binspection-and-acceptance-of-the-work">2010B 09 (2008-05-12) Inspection and acceptance of the Work</h2>
<p>All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada. Inspection and acceptance of the Work by Canada do not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for defects or other failures to meet the requirements of the Contract. Canada will have the right to reject any work that is not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract and require its correction or replacement at the Contractor's expense.</p>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Binvoice-submission">2010B 10 (2013-03-21) Invoice submission</h2>
<ol>

            invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</li>

<li>deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li>the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li>if applicable, the method of shipment together with date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Btaxes">2010B 11 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol>
<li> Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes. </li>
<li> Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation. The Contractor agrees to remit to appropriate tax authorities any amounts of Applicable Taxes paid or due. </li>
<li> The Contractor is not entitled to use Canada’s exemptions from any tax, such as provincial sales taxes, unless otherwise specified by law.

<li> In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award. However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change. </li>
<li>Tax Withholding of 15 Percent – Canada Revenue Agency </li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite>Income Tax Regulations</cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite>Canada Revenue Agency.</cite> The amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.</p>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Btransportation-costs">2010B 12 (2010-01-11) Transportation costs</h2>

<h2 id="2022-01-282010Btransportation-carriers-liability">2010B 13 (2010-01-11) Transportation carriers' liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for shipment.</p>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Bpayment-period">2010B 14 (2014-09-25) Payment period</h2>
<ol>
<li>Canada's standard payment period is 30 days. The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is considered overdue on the 31st day following that date and interest will be paid automatically in accordance with the section 15.</li>
<li>If the content of the invoice and its substantiating documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within 15 days will only result in the date specified in subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2022-01-282010Binterest-on-overdue-accounts">2010B 15 (2018-06-21) Interest on overdue accounts</h2>
