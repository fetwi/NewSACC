<li>By submitting a bid, bidders confirm that they understand that being convicted of certain offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a contract.

<li>
Period of Ineligibility for Providing False or Misleading Information<br/>
The Bidder confirms that it understands that where it has made a false declaration or provided false or misleading information under these Integrity Provisions, the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr> will declare a Bidder to be ineligible to be awarded contracts for a period of ten years.

The period of suspension is effective from the date of determination by the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr>.

<li>
Third Party Validation<br/>

<li value="2">The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing
or has provided the goods and services described in the bid

a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the
criteria established above.</li>

section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and
provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that
it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to
have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within
Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of
interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest
or unfair advantage exists.</li>

simply because they have met previous requirements.</p>
