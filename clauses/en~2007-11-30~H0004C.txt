<pre>1.     Canada's standard payment period is thirty (30) days. The payment 
       period is measured from the date an invoice in acceptable form and 
       content is received in accordance with the Contract or the date the 
       Work is delivered in acceptable condition as required in the 
       Contract, whichever is later. A payment is considered overdue on the 
       31st day following that date and interest will be paid automatically 
       in accordance with the section entitled Interest on Overdue Accounts 
       of the general conditions.

2.     If the content of the invoice and its substantiating documentation 
       are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work is not in 
       acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor within 
       fifteen (15) days of receipt. The 30-day payment period begins upon 
       receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or corrected Work. 
       Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within fifteen (15) days 
       will only result in the date specified in subsection 1 of the clause 
       to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest on overdue 
       accounts.
