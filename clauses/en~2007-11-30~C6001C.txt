<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all contracts, except firm priced contracts, when it 
is necessary to ensure against the contractor making changes or carrying out 
additional work without the prior approval of the contracting officer.</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Canada's total liability to the Contractor under the Contract must 
       not exceed $ _______.  Customs duties are _____ (<strong><em>insert</em></strong><em> "</em><span class="wsInlineRemark">included</span><em>", </em><span class="wsInlineRemark">
       "excluded</span><em>" </em><strong><em>or</em></strong><em> "</em><span class="wsInlineRemark">exempt</span>") and Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized 
       Sales Tax is extra, if applicable.

2.     No increase in the total liability of Canada or in the price of the 
       Work resulting from any design changes, modifications or 
       interpretations of the specifications, will be authorized or paid to 
       the Contractor unless these design changes, modifications or 
       interpretations have been approved, in writing, by the Contracting 
       Authority before their incorporation into the Work.  The Contractor  
       must not perform any work or provide any service that would result 
       in Canada's total liability being exceeded before obtaining the 
       written approval of the Contracting Authority.  The Contractor must 
       notify the Contracting Authority in writing as to the adequacy of 
       this sum:

       (a)    when it is 75 percent committed, or 

       (b)    four (4) months before the Contract expiry date, or 

       (c)    if the Contractor considers that the contract funds provided 
              are inadequate for the completion of the Work,

              whichever comes first.

3.     If the notification is for inadequate contract funds, the Contractor 
       must provide to the Contracting Authority, a written estimate for 
       the additional funds required.  Provision of such information by the 
       Contractor does not increase Canada's liability.
