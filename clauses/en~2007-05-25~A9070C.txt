<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks – Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
 Use the following clause in contracts.  The contracting officer must ensure that 
the applicable law selected by the bidder, or in absence of such selection, the 
law indicated in the bid solicitation, is inserted in the blank.  The bidder, as 
instructed, will be able to propose a change to the applicable laws in its bid.

Use the following clause only if the low dollar value (2T-LDV1), medium 
complexity (2T-MED1) and higher complexity (2T-HIGH1) templates are not used.

Note: 	For the French version of the clause, the term "in" was not translated 
because there is no such common term in French for all the provinces and 
territory.  Therefore, the word "en" must be added in front of Alberta, 
Colombie-Britannique, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Nouvelle-Écosse; the word "au" 
in front of Manitoba, Québec, Nouveau-Brunswick, Yukon and Nunavut, the word "à" 
in front of Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador and l'Ile-du-Prince-Édouard, and the words 
"dans les" in front of Territoires du Nord Ouest.
