<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause when a proposed contractor has started work with the 
authorization of a government official, before contract authorization, and the 
work has not been completed.  This will ensure that the work done before the 
contract date will be covered by the contract.

If the work has been completed, the contracting officer must instead request 
that a confirming order be prepared by legal counsel. 

The second paragraph is to be deleted if the client department does not wish to 
retain the rights to the intellectual property.

Use the clause in conjunction with C0210C.
