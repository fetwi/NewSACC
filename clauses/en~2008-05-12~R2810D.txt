       bound by economic sanctions imposed by Canada.  As a result, the 
       Government of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services 
       that originate, either directly or indirectly, from the countries or 
       persons subject to economic sanctions.

       the Contract should the imposition of sanctions against a country or 
       person or the addition of a good or service to the list of 
       sanctioned goods or services cause an impossibility of performance 
       for the Contractor, the Contractor may request that the Contract be 
       terminated in accordance with GC7.3, "Termination of Contract".
