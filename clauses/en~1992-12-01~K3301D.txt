<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>(1)    In the Contract:

       (a)    "<strong>Background Intellectual Property</strong>" means all Technical 
              Information that is not Foreground Intellectual Property, and 
              that is proprietary to the Contractor, its subcontractors or 
              any other supplier of the Contractor;

       (b)    "<strong>Foreground Intellectual Property</strong>" means any Invention first 
              conceived, developed or reduced to practice as part of the 
              Work under the Contract and all Technical Information 
              collected, developed or produced as part of the Work under 
              the Contract;

       (c)    "<strong>Invention</strong>" means any new and useful art, process, 
              methodology, technique, machine, manufacture or composition 
              of matter, or any new and useful improvement of any art, 
              process, methodology, technique, machine, manufacture or 
              composition of matter, whether or not patentable; and

       (d)    "<strong>Technical Information</strong>" means all information of a scientific 
              or technical nature relating to the Work, whether oral or 
              recorded in any form or medium and whether or not 
              copyrightable, including but not limited to Inventions, 
              designs, methods, processes, techniques, know-how, reports, 
              drawings, plans, specifications, photographs, models, 
              prototypes, patterns, samples, schematics, experimental or 
              test data, and computer software, source code, data files, 
              and documentation.

(2)    The Contractor shall promptly report and fully disclose to the 
       Minister the conception, development, or reduction to practice of 
       any Invention that could be Foreground Intellectual Property, and 
       shall report and fully disclose to the Minister all other Foreground 
       Intellectual Property at the completion of the Work or at such other 
       time as the Minister or the Contract may require.

(3)    Copyright, patent and all other proprietary rights to all Foreground 
       Intellectual Property shall, immediately upon its conception, 
       development, reduction to practice or production, vest in and remain 
       the property of Canada, and the Contractor agrees that it shall have 
       no right in or to any such Foreground Intellectual Property except 
       any right that may be granted by Canada.  The Contractor hereby 
       permanently waives its moral rights, as defined in the Copyright Act, 
       R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, to all Technical Information conceived, 
       prepared or developed by the Contractor as part of the Work under 
       the Contract, and shall provide to Canada, at the completion of the 
       Contract or at such other time as the Contract or the Minister may 
       require, a written permanent waiver of such moral rights from every 
       author who contributed to such Technical Information in a form 
       acceptable to the Minister.

(4)    The Contractor shall, not later than one month after the effective 
       date of the Contract, provide to the Minister a detailed list of all 
       of the Background Intellectual Property that might be used or 
       required by the Contractor or any of its subcontractors or suppliers 
       in the performance of the Contract.  All Technical Information used 
       in or incorporated into the Work under the Contract that is not 
       included in the list of Background Intellectual Property provided by 
       the Contractor shall be deemed to be Foreground Intellectual 
       Property that is subject to subsection (3).

(5)    The Contractor shall not, without the written permission of the 
       Minister, incorporate into the Work any Background Intellectual 
       Property unless it owns or has procured the rights to the 
       intellectual property necessary to comply with subsection (3).

(6)    The Contractor shall not at any time use or disclose to any person 
       any Foreground Intellectual Property referred to in subsection (3) 
       except as may be necessary to carry out the Work under the Contract, 
       and shall not sell, other than to Canada, any articles or things 
       embodying any such Foreground Intellectual Property.  Subject to the 
       Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1 and to any right of 
       Canada under this Contract to sublicense the use of the Background 
       Intellectual Property, Canada shall not release or disclose outside 
       the Government of Canada any Background Intellectual Property 
       incorporated into or used in the Work.  The foregoing obligations of 
       a party do not apply to any intellectual property if the same 
       information:

       (a)    is publicly available from a source other than that party;

       (b)    is or becomes known to that party from a source other than 
              the other party, except from any source that is known to that 
              party to be under an obligation to the other party not to 
              disclose the intellectual property; or

       (c)    in the case of Canada, is independently developed by Canada.

(7)    Before or after final payment to the Contractor, the Minister shall 
       have the right to examine all records and supporting data of the 
       Contractor which the Minister reasonably deems pertinent to the 
       discovery or identification of Technical Information to which 
       subsection (2) applies.
 
(8)    Where title to or the copyright, patent, or other proprietary rights 
       in Technical Information or any other thing or information vests in 
       Canada under the Contract, the Contractor shall execute such 
       conveyances or other documents relating to title or copyright, 
       patent, or other proprietary rights as the Minister may require, and 
       the Contractor shall, at Canada's expense, afford the Minister all 
       reasonable assistance in the prosecution of any patent application 
       or registration of copyright or an industrial design, including the 
       assistance of the inventor in the case of Inventions.
