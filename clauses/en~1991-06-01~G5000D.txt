</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Ship Repairers' Liability Insurance shall be effected and maintained in 
force, in an amount usual for a contract of this nature, but, in any case, 
for not less than $5,000,000.  This insurance shall be in the joint names 
of Canada and the Contractor and shall include a Cross Liability clause.

a)  LITIGATION RIGHTS:  It is understood and agreed that where any suit is 
instituted for or against Canada which the insurer, or insurers would, but 
for this clause, have the right to pursue or defend on behalf of Canada as 
joint named insured under this Contract for insurance, the insurer, or 
insurers shall promptly request the Attorney General of Canada for 
instructions by sending a registered letter to the Director, Civil 
Litigation,  Department of Justice, Kent and Wellington Streets, Ottawa, 
Ontario K1A 0H8.

b)  CROSS LIABILITY:  Any act or omission on the part of one or another of 
the Insured hereunder shall not prejudice the rights or interests of any 
other Insured.  This policy, subject to its limits of liability, shall 
apply to each Insured in the same manner and to the same extent as if a 
separate policy had been issued to each.  The inclusion herein of more than 
one Insured shall not operate to increase the limits of the Insurers' 
liability.

c)  EVIDENCE OF INSURANCE:  Upon execution of the Contract, the Contractor 
   will forward to the Minister, a certified true copy of either the 
   Insurance Certificate with relevant clauses attached or the Insurance 
   Policy issued by the insurer(s) as evidence that the required insurance 
   has been effected.
