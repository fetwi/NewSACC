<h2 id="general-information">General information </h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period. Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p> The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated expenditure specified in a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) are only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods, services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2 id="integrity-provisions">01 (2016-04-04) Integrity provisions—offer</h2>
<ol>
<li>The <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em> (the “Policy”) in effect on the date the Request for Standing Offers (RFSO) is issued, and all related Directives in effect on that date, are incorporated by reference into, and form a binding part of the RFSO. The Offeror must comply with the Policy and Directives, which can be found at <em><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/politique-policy-eng.html" rel="external">Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</a></em>. </li>
<li>Under the Policy, charges and convictions of certain offences against a Supplier, its affiliates or first tier subcontractors, and other circumstances, will or may result in a determination by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) that the Supplier is ineligible to be issued or is suspended from being issued a standing offer and to enter into a contract with Canada. The list of ineligible and suspended Suppliers is contained in <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Integrity Database. The Policy describes how enquiries can be made regarding the ineligibility or suspension of Suppliers.</li>
<li>In addition to all other information required in the Request for Standing Offers, the Offeror must provide the following:
      <ol type="a">
<li>by the time stated in the Policy, all information required by the Policy described under the heading “Information to be Provided when Bidding, Contracting or Entering into a Real Property Agreement”; and</li>
<li>with its offer, a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy. The list of foreign criminal charges and convictions must be submitted using an Integrity Declaration Form, which can be found at <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/declaration-eng.html" rel="external">Declaration form for procurement</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Subject to subsection 5, by submitting an offer in response to this Request for Standing Offers, the Offeror certifies that:
      <ol type="a">
<li>it has read and understands the <em><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/politique-policy-eng.html" rel="external">Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</a></em>;</li>
<li>it understands that certain domestic and foreign criminal charges and convictions, and other circumstances, as described in the Policy, will or may result in a determination of ineligibility or suspension under the Policy;</li>
<li>it is aware that Canada may request additional information, certifications, and validations from the Offeror or a third party for purposes of making a determination of ineligibility or suspension;</li>
<li>it has provided with its offer a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy;</li>
<li>none of the domestic criminal offences, and other circumstances, described in the Policy that will or may result in a determination of ineligibility or suspension, apply to it, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors; and</li>
<li>it is not aware of a determination of ineligibility or suspension issued by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> that applies to it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Where an Offeror is unable to provide any of the certifications required by subsection 4, it must submit with its offer a completed Integrity Declaration Form, which can be found at <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/declaration-eng.html" rel="external">Declaration form for procurement</a>.</li>
<li>Canada will declare non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information requested is incomplete or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in a certification or declaration is found by Canada to be false or misleading in any respect. If Canada establishes after issuance of the Standing Offer that the Offeror provided a false or misleading certification or declaration, Canada may set aside the Standing Offer and terminate for default any resulting contracts. Pursuant to the Policy, Canada may also determine the Offeror to be ineligible for issuance of a standing offer for providing a false or misleading certification or declaration. </li>
</ol>
