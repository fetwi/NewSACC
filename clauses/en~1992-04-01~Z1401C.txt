<p>The Canadian Commercial Corporation may at any time, by a
written order, make changes, within the general scope of this
Contract, in any one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">drawings, designs or specifications, where the
supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the
 <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government in accordance therewith;</li>
<li value="2">method of shipment or packing;</li>
<li value="3">place of delivery; and</li>
<li value="4">the amount of <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government-furnished property.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the
estimated cost of, or the time required for the performance of any
part of the Work under this Contract, whether changed or not
changed by any such order, or otherwise affects any provision of
this Contract, an equitable adjustment shall be made</p>
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">in the estimated cost or delivery schedule, or both,
and</li>
<li value="2">in such other provisions of the Contract as may be so
affected, and the Contract shall be modified in writing
accordingly. Any claim by the Contractor for adjustment under this
clause must be asserted within twenty (20) days from the date of
the receipt by it of the notification of change, provided, however,
that <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, if it decides that the facts justify such action, may
receive and act upon any such claim asserted at any time prior to
final payment under this Contract. Failure to agree to any
adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within
the meaning of the clause of this Contract entitled "Disputes".
However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from
proceeding with the Contract as changed.</li>
