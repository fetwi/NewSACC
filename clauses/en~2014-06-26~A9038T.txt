<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks – Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use the following clause when it is beneficial, but not mandatory, for bidders to view the site where the work will be performed to improve their understanding of the requirement. In the case of marine requirements, the word "Vessel" may be added to the title.
 </p>
<p>
  The visit remains optional but contracting officers must select one of the following options provided in the clause:
 </p>
<p>
  Select Option 1 when bidders are only requested to communicate with the Contracting Authority to confirm attendance but should not be refused access to the site if they have not done so.
 </p>
<p>
  Select Option 2 when bidders who do not communicate with the Contracting Authority to submit the name(s) of attendee(s) will be refused access to the site.  As option 2 is typically used for requirements involving security reasons, paragraph 2 of option 2 requires that the Bidders provide the name(s) of the person(s) holding a valid security clearance at the required level.
 </p>
<p>
  In both cases, bidders will not be precluded from submitting a bid if they do not attend or send a representative. Consult section
  
   3.116 Site Visits
