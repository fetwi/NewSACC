<pre>If this clause is signed and dated, the Bidder represents and warrants that, 
of the goods and/or services being offered to Canada, no less than ____ 
percent of the bid price consists of goods and services of Canadian origin, 
and that the bid therefore qualifies for inclusion in Priority Group 1 as 
defined in the DSS Canadian Content Policy published in Chapter 5 of the 
DSS Supply Manual.

Bids that include this representation and warranty may be given preference 
over other bids, in accordance with the procedures set out in the DSS 
Canadian Content Policy.

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation 
and warranty to evaluate bids and may rely upon such representation and 
warranty to enter into any contract resulting from this bid. Such 
representation and warranty of Canadian Content may be verified in such 
manner as the Minister may reasonably require.

Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such covenant, 
the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting from this 
bid as being in default.
