<pre>Her Majesty's liability to you for services actually requested and accepted 
under any Standing Offer shall not, unless otherwise authorized in writing 
by the Minister, exceed the estimated expenditure specified on the front 
page of the Standing Offer, and you shall not act upon any Call-ups under 
this Standing Offer which cause the estimated expenditure to be exceeded.  
You shall notify the Contracting Authority, DSS, in writing as to the 
adequacy of the estimated expenditure when it is 75 percent committed, or 
two (2) months prior to the expiry of the Standing Offer, whichever comes 
first.

All rates are subject to review by DSS if significant increase to the 
Financial Limitation is required.  Failure to submit the necessary support 
data for rate review, on request, will result in disqualification of the 
supplier's offer and termination of the use of the RSMO.

EXCEEDING THE FINANCIAL LIMITATION:  The Department of Supply and Services 
   is the sole authority authorized by Treasury Board to contract for 
   temporary help.  The standing offers arrangement established a vehicle 
   giving government departments the authority to issue individual contract 
   or call-ups against the standing offers in place.  Individual 
   contractors are required to closely monitor the financial limitation of 
   their standing offer as detailed in the above clause entitled Financial 
   Limitation.  In the event a supplier accepts call-ups which exceed the 
   current financial limitation, DSS will remind all government departments 
   that the Department of Supply and Services is the sole contracting 
   authority for temporary help and all departments will be requested to 
   cease to make any further call-ups.  Furthermore, failure of the 
   supplier to adequately control the level of its financial limitation may 
   result in the deletion of the firm from the source list for the 
   following year.
