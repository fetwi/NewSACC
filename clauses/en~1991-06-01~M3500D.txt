 BASIS OF PAYMENT:

The posted prices per litre are subject to upward or downward adjustment to 
   reflect any monetary change in the posted prices on the date of delivery.  
   The Offerer shall give written notice to this Department within fifteen 
   (15) days of the effective date of a posted price change.  If the 
   Offerer fails to give notice within the fifteen (15) days, the effective 
   date of the change in posted price will be the date upon which the 
   Offerer's written notice is received by this Department.  In the event 
   that the posted price change is not acceptable to this Department, the 
   Crown may terminate the Standing Offer within fifteen (15) days of 
   receipt of the posted price change; however, the Crown is liable to pay 
   the Offerer's posted price, less the firm discount, for all products 
   called up and delivered between the effective date and the date of 
   termination of Contract/withdrawal of Standing Offer.
