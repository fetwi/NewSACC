<p>The Acquisitions Program of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) has implemented departmental standard procurement templates to facilitate the use of the Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual by the Acquisitions Branch contracting officers in their acquisition documents for the procurement of goods and services on behalf of client departments. </p>
<h2 id="2022-07-06TEMPLATES10">Standard Procurement Templates</h2>
<p>The standard procurement templates are available to federal government department and agency contracting officers on GCpedia.</p>
<p>Suppliers who require a copy of the templates or have any questions regarding the templates, may send their requests to the Procurement Policy and Tools Division by email at: TPSGC.Outilsdapprovisionnement-ProcurementTools.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca. However, for such requests associated with a solicitation still active and currently posted on the Government Electronic Tendering System (GETS), please communicate with the contracting authority. Note that references to the <abbr title="Higher Complexity">HC</abbr>, <abbr title="Medium Complexity">MC</abbr> and Simple templates in <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Requests for Supply Arrangements are provided as examples only. The latest versions of the template and terms and conditions will be used at time of bid solicitation.</p>
<p>There are currently six (6) templates addressing the different methods of supply and complexity of solicitations for competitive and non-competitive procurements. The templates are available in Microsoft Word (.doc) file format with an associated marked-up <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> file that shows the latest changes.</p>

<p>The templates are part of the Department’s commitment to promote a “common look and feel” in acquisition documents by standardizing terminology, simplifying contract language by using plain language, and ensuring greater consistency and uniformity. Contracting officers must not modify or change the order and content of these templates except where indicated in the template. The procedures for the use of the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Standard Procurement Templates have been updated and reformatted and are now hosted on the Acquisitions Program Policy Directorate GCpedia page. The policy on the departmental standard procurement documents is available in Chapter 4 of the Supply Manual, section 4.15.1.</p>
