<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Canada's liability to the Contractor under this Contract shall not exceed $_____, 
unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Minister. The Contractor 
shall not be obliged to perform any work or provide any service that would 
cause the total liability of Canada to exceed the said sum, unless an 
increase is so authorized.  The Contractor shall notify the Minister as to 
the adequacy of this sum when it is 75 percent committed or four (4) months 
prior to the final delivery date stated in the Contract, whichever comes 
first.  If the notification refers to inadequate funds, then the Contractor 
shall, at the same time, provide a new estimate of the total cost of the 
Work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contractor shall notify the 
Minister and provide a new estimate of cost if, at any time, the Contractor 
considers the funds provided are inadequate for the completion of the Work.  
The giving of such notifications and estimates shall not increase Canada's 
liability over the said sum.

The Contractor shall not adopt any change or changes in the design or in 
   the specifications or in the Work that would cause an increase in the 
   cost of the Work, until the Contractor receives written authorization of 
   the Minister (under design change procedure or otherwise). Costs 
   incurred without such authorization shall not be reimbursed by Canada.
