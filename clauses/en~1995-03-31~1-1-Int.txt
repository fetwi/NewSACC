<pre>Prior to the release of the SACC Manual, the following sets of Standard 
Instructions and Conditions were printed on the reverse of page 1 of the 
procurement documents or inserted as an attachment into solicitation 
packages. Standard Instructions (with the exception of DSS-MAS 9403-2) will 
now be referred to at the beginning of each bid solicitation in clause 
A0000T and in each contract in clause K0000D.  For Standing Offers, these 
will now be referred to in either clause M0000T or M0000C as appropriate.  
The specified Standard Instructions will form part of both the solicitation 
and the resulting contract.  DSS-MAS 9403-2 will be referenced in Notices 
of Termination for Convenience.
