Hands</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">By giving notice in writing to the Contractor in
accordance with GC2.3, "Notices", Canada, without any other
authorization, may take all or any part of the Work out of the
Contractor's hands, and may employ such means as Canada sees fit to
have the Work completed if the Contractor
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">fails to remedy any delay in the commencement or
default in the diligent performance of the Work to the satisfaction
of Canada within six days of Canada giving notice to the Contractor
in writing in accordance with GC2.3, "Notices";</li>
<li value="2">defaults in the completion of any part of the Work
within the time fixed for its completion by the Contract;</li>
<li value="3">becomes insolvent, or has committed an act of
bankruptcy, and has neither made a proposal to its creditors nor
filed a notice of intention to make such a proposal, pursuant to
the <cite>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</cite>;</li>
<li value="4">abandons the work;</li>
<li value="5">makes an assignment of the Contract without the
consent required by GC1.16, "Assignment", or</li>
<li value="6">otherwise fails to observe or perform any of the
provisions of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the whole or any part of the Work is taken out of
the Contractor's hands, the Contractor's right to any further
payment that is due or accruing due under the Contract is, subject
only to paragraph 3) of GC7.1, extinguished, and the Contractor is
liable to pay Canada, upon demand, an amount that is equal to the
amount of all loss and damage incurred or sustained by Canada in
respect of the Contractor's failure to complete the Work.</li>
<li value="3">If the whole or any part of the Work that is taken
out of the Contractor's hands is completed by Canada, Canada may
pay the Contractor the amount, if any, of the holdback or a
progress claim as determined by Canada that had accrued and was due
prior to the date on which the Work was taken out of the
Contractor's hands and that is not required for the purposes of
having the Work performed or of compensating Canada for any other
loss or damage incurred or sustained by reason of the Contractor's
default.</li>
<li value="4">The taking of the Work or any part thereof out of the
Contractor's hands does not relieve the Contractor from any
obligation under the Contract or imposed by law except the
obligation to complete the performance of that part of the Work
that was taken out of the Contractor's hands.</li>
<li value="5">If the Work or any part thereof is taken out of the
Contractor's hands, all Plant and Material and the interest of the
Contractor, or its suppliers or subcontractors at any tier, in all
real property, licences, powers and privileges acquired, used or
provided by the Contractor, or its suppliers or subcontractors at
any tier, under the Contract shall continue to be the property of
Canada without compensation.</li>
<li value="6">When Canada certifies that any Plant, Material, or
any interest of the Contractor is no longer required for the
purposes of the Work, or that it is not in the interests of Canada
to retain that Plant, Material, or interest, it shall revert to the
Contractor.</li>
<li value="7">If the Contractor has become insolvent or has
committed an act of bankruptcy, and has either made a proposal to
its creditors or filed a notice of intention to make such a
proposal, pursuant to the <cite>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</cite>, the Contractor shall immediately forward a copy of the
proposal or the notice of intention to Canada.</li>

<h2 id="2008-05-12R2870Dsuspension-of-work">GC7.2 (2007-05-25) Suspension of Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">When, in Canada's opinion, it is in the public
interest to do so, Canada may require the Contractor to suspend
performance of the Work either for a specified or an unspecified
period, by giving a notice of suspension in writing to the
Contractor in accordance with GC2.3, "Notices".</li>
<li value="2">When a notice of suspension is received by the
Contractor, the Contractor shall suspend all operations in respect
of the Work except those that Canada determines are necessary for
the care and preservation of the Work, Plant and Material.</li>
<li value="3">During a period of suspension, the Contractor shall
not remove any part of the Work, Plant or Material from its site
without the consent of Canada.</li>
<li value="4">If a period of suspension is 60 days or less, the
Contractor shall resume the performance of the Work on the
expiration of that period, and the Contractor is entitled to be
paid the extra costs necessarily incurred by the Contractor as a
result of the suspension, determined in accordance with GC6.4,
"Determination of Price".</li>
<li value="5">If a period of suspension is more than 60 days,
Canada and the Contractor may agree that the performance of the
Work shall be continued by the Contractor, and the Contractor shall
resume performance of the Work subject to any terms and conditions
agreed upon by Canada and the Contractor. If Canada and the
Contractor do not agree that performance of the Work shall be
continued by the Contractor, or upon the terms and conditions under
which the Contractor shall continue the Work, the notice of
suspension shall be deemed to be a notice of termination pursuant
to GC7.3, "Termination of Contract".</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2008-05-12R2870Dtermination-of-contract">GC7.3 (2007-05-25) Termination of Contract</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may terminate the Contract at any time by
giving a notice of termination in writing to the Contractor in
accordance with GC2.3, "Notices".</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor receives a notice of termination,
the Contractor shall forthwith cease all operations in performance
of the Contract, subject to any conditions stipulated in the
notice.</li>
<li value="3">Subject to paragraph 4) of GC7.3, if the Contract is
terminated, Canada shall pay the Contractor an amount determined to
be due to the Contractor pursuant to GC6.4, "Determination of
Price", less the aggregate of all amounts that were paid to the
Contractor by Canada and all amounts that are due to Canada from
the Contractor pursuant to the Contract.</li>
<li value="4">In no event shall the total amount payable by Canada
to the Contractor exceed the amount, calculated in accordance with
GC5, "Terms of Payment", that would have been payable to the
Contractor had the Contractor completed the Work.</li>
<li value="5">Payment to the Contractor, if any, shall be made as
soon as practicable under the circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2008-05-12R2870Dsecurity-deposit">GC7.4 (2008-05-12) Security Deposit - Forfeiture or Return</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the Work is taken out of the Contractor's hands,
or the Contractor is in breach of, or in default under, the
Contract, Canada may convert a security deposit to Canada's own
use.</li>
<li value="2">If Canada converts a security deposit, the amount
realized shall be deemed to be an amount due from Canada to the
Contractor under the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">Any balance of the amount realized that remains after
payment of all losses, damage and claims of Canada and others shall
be paid by Canada to the Contractor if, in the opinion of Canada,
it is not required for the purposes of the Contract.</li>
