<pre>1.     The Part Number(s) and NATO Supply Code(s) for Manufacturers (NSCM(s)), 
       or the Commercial And Government Entity (CAGE) code(s) indicated 
       herein are the only Part Number(s) and NSCM/Cage Code(s) known to 
       Department of National Defence that meet the form, fit and function 
       requirements of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved 
       type design of the aircraft in which they will be installed.  Should 
       a bidder propose an alternative Part Number or NSCM/Cage Code and be 
       under consideration for award of a contract to supply the item(s), 
       that bidder must provide upon request and within three (3) working 
       days after notification of the request, the technical information (e.g. 
       drawings, specifications, engineering reports, and/or test reports) 
       necessary to clearly demonstrate that the item(s) proposed to be 
       supplied has form, fit and function characteristics equivalent to 
       the Part Number(s) and NSCM/Cage Code(s) indicated herein.  It is 
       also acceptable that the necessary technical information be supplied 
       at the same time as the bid.

2.     Failure to provide the required data, either with the bid or within 
       three (3) working days after notification of the request, will 
       render the bid non-compliant in respect of the item(s) for which 
       such information was requested.

3.     If the part is not manufactured by the OEM of the aircraft, then it 
       must be manufactured by an authorized supplier to the OEM or by the 
       original manufacturer of the item chosen for use by the OEM of the 
       aircraft (or the successor of or licensed by that original 
       manufacturer).

4.     Canada reserves the right to verify with the OEM of the aircraft 
       that the manufacturer of an item proposed is in fact authorized by 
       the OEM to produce that item or supplies that item to the OEM.

5.     In the event the Bidder proposes to supply equivalent item(s) not in 
       the NSCM/Cage Code(s) or the Part Number(s) specified herein, the 
       Bidder must complete in full and supply with its bid a "Substitution 
       Notice" as detailed in Annex `A' to the bid solicitation.

6.     Records of the manufacturer sufficient to constitute proof of origin 
       must be available for review, and must be retained and maintained by 
       the successful bidder for three (3) years following delivery of the 
       last item under the contract.  Such records shall include the 
       following:

       (a)    sufficient information to identify the item by type, class, 
              style, grade (including lot or batch number), cast number, 
              the source of the part, and the date and place of manufacture, 
              as appropriate; 

       (b)    the name and description (or other positive identification) 
              of, and the application issue of, the specification, drawing, 
              process and inspection requirements, as appropriate; 

       (c)    records of all inspections and tests carried out, including 
              those carried out on behalf of either the manufacturer or the 
              successful bidder; 

       (d)    copies of any Certificate of Conformance or Certificate of 
              Compliance issued by the manufacturer; 

       (e)    and any other relevant technical data.
 
                                 <strong>ANNEX `A'</strong><strong></strong>
