1.     From time to time, in compliance with United Nations obligations or 
       other international agreements, Canada imposes restrictions on trade, 
       financial transactions or other dealings with a foreign country or 
       its nationals.  These sanctions may be implemented by regulation 
       under the <em>United Nations Act</em> (UNA), R.S.C. 1985, c. U-2 , the <em>
       Special Economic Measures Act</em> (SEMA), S.C. 1992, c. 17, or the <em>
       Export and Import Permits Act</em> (EIPA), R.S.C. 1985, c. E-19.  The 
       Offeror agrees that it will, pursuant to any call-up made against 
       this Standing Offer, comply with any such regulations imposed during 
       the life of the Standing Offer and during each call-up, and will 
       inform its subcontractors of the existence of the SEMA and of its 
       regulations in force on the effective date of the Standing Offer. In 
       the event of such regulation preventing the Offeror from performing 
       all or part of its obligations pursuant to a call-up made against 
       this Standing Offer, the Offeror shall treat the situation as a 
       force majeure, and forthwith inform Canada of the situation and 
       follow the procedure applicable to force majeure.

2.     The Offeror agrees that Canada relies on the Offeror's undertaking 
       in subsection 1. to entitle Canada to issue call-ups pursuant to 
       this Standing Offer, and that any breach of the undertaking shall 
       entitle Canada to consider this Standing Offer withdrawn, to 
       terminate for default any call-up made pursuant to the Standing 
       Offer under the provisions relating to default by the Offeror, and 
       therefore to recover damages from the Offeror arising out of 
       terminated call-ups made against this Standing Offer, including 
       reprocurement costs arising out of such a termination.
