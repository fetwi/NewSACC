<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Payment in advance by Canada to the Contractor for the Work shall be 
       made within:

       (a)    thirty (30) days following the date on which an invoice and 
              substantiating documentation are received according to the 
              terms of the Contract; or

       (b)    thirty (30) days following the date specified herein for the 
              making of such advance payment;

       whichever date is the later.

2.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the invoice or the 
       substantiating documentation, within fifteen (15) days of its 
       receipt, Canada shall notify the Contractor of the nature of the 
       objection. "Form of the invoice" means an invoice which contains or 
       is accompanied by such substantiating documentation as Canada 
       requires.  Failure by Canada to act within fifteen (15) days will 
       only result in the date specified in subsection 1 of the clause to 
       apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest on overdue 
       accounts.
