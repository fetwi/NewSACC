       any, and all other requirements of the <em>Contract</em>. 

2.     No materials or parts shall be used or processed and no <em>finished 
       work</em> shall be submitted for acceptance or shall be delivered unless 
       or until approved by the Contractor's inspection staff and, wherever

       Inspector</em>.  The Contractor shall keep proper and adequate inspection 
       records which shall at all times be open to examination by the <em>
       Inspector</em> who may make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom.

3.     The <em>Minister</em> and the <em>Inspector</em> shall have access to the <em>Work</em> at all 
       times and to the plant and premises where any part of the <em>Work</em> is 
       being carried on, and may make such inspections and tests of the <em>
       Work</em> and of parts, materials and work-in-process as the <em>Minister</em> or 
       the <em>Inspector</em> may think fit.  The Contractor shall provide at its 
       own expense all assistance and facilities, test pieces and samples 
       which the <em>Minister</em> or the <em>Inspector</em> may reasonably require for the 
       carrying out of any such inspections and any such tests as aforesaid, 
       and shall forward at its own expense such test pieces and samples to 
       such person or location as the <em>Minister</em> or the <em>Inspector</em> may direct.  
       The Contractor shall at its own expense provide the <em>Minister</em> and the <em>
       Inspector</em> with such accommodation as they may require for the 
       purpose of such inspections and any such tests and for the exercise 
       of any other powers conferred upon them <em>hereunder</em>.

1.     All <em>specifications</em>, drawings, patterns, samples and other 
       information furnished the Contractor in connection with the <em>Contract</em> 
       shall be used by the Contractor solely for the purpose of carrying 
       out the <em>Work</em> and for no other purpose except with the consent in 
       writing of the <em>Minister</em> and shall remain the property of <em>Canada</em> and 
       be returned to <em>Canada</em> or the <em>Minister</em> upon demand.

       omission, unless otherwise agreed to by the <em>Minister</em>.


<strong>1026A  06     (01/06/91)    Inspection </strong>

All work shall be subject to inspection by the <em>Inspector</em> prior to 
acceptance. Should the <em>Work</em> be defective in materials or workmanship or 
otherwise not be in accordance with the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>
Inspector</em> shall have the right to reject the <em>Work</em> or to require its 
correction. Inspection by the <em>Inspector</em> either at the plant of the 
Contractor or of any of its subcontractors shall not relieve the Contractor 
from responsibility for defects or other failure to meet the requirements 
of the <em>Contract</em>.  The Contractor agrees to accept and be bound by the <em>
Inspector</em>'s interpretation of the meaning of the <em>specifications</em>.

thereof shall vest in <em>Canada</em> upon delivery to the consignee and acceptance 
thereof by the consignee.  Acceptance by the consignee of the <em>Work</em> or any 
part thereof shall be deemed to be acceptance thereof by <em>Canada</em>.


<strong>1026A  08     (01/06/91)    Warranty </strong>

              requirements as a result of faulty or inefficient manufacture, 
              material or workmanship;
 
       (b)    deliver such <em>finished work</em> free from all defects to the 
              delivery point specified in the <em>Contract</em>, unless otherwise 
              agreed to by the <em>Minister</em>;

       provided that where, in the opinion of the <em>Minister</em>, it is not 
       expedient to remove such defective <em>finished work</em> from its location, 
       the Contractor shall replace or make good the defective <em>finished 
       work</em> at such location, and shall be paid the actual <em>cost</em> incurred in 
       so doing (including reasonable travelling and living expenses) with 
       no allowance thereon by way of overhead profit, less a sum 
       equivalent to the <em>cost</em> of making good the defective <em>finished work</em>

       Government Issue</em> and shall mark the same as being <em>Canada</em>'s property.

2.     All <em>Government Issue</em> (except such as are installed or incorporated 
       in the <em>Work</em>) shall be returned to <em>Canada</em> upon demand, in the same

       Contractor shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting 
       from ordinary wear and tear or causes beyond the Contractors' 
       control.

3.     All scrap and waste materials derived from any <em>Government Issue</em> or 
       from any other materials, articles or things which are the property 
       of <em>Canada</em>, shall, unless otherwise specifically provided <em>herein</em>, 
       remain the property of <em>Canada</em> and shall be disposed of only as

progress payments or accountable advances or otherwise, title in and to all 
materials, parts, work-in-process and <em>finished work</em> so paid for by such 
progress payments or accountable advances or otherwise shall vest and 
remain in <em>Canada</em> unless already so vested under any provision of the <em>
Contract</em> and the Contractor shall be responsible therefor in accordance 
with the provisions of section 14 <em>hereof</em>, it being understood and agreed 
that such vesting of title in <em>Canada</em> shall not constitute acceptance by <em>
Canada</em> of such materials, parts, work-in-process and <em>finished work</em> and 
shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations to perform the <em>Work</em> in 
conformity with the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>1026A  13     (13/12/99)    Further Assurances </strong>

Wherever it is <em>herein</em> provided that title to any parts, materials,

       the written permission of the <em>Minister</em>, except that the Contractor 
       may disclose to a subcontractor, authorized in accordance with this <em>

2.     When the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Work</em>, or any information referred to in 
       subsection 1 is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL or

       security purposes at any time during the term of the <em>Contract</em>, and 
       the Contractor shall comply with, and ensure that any such 
       subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by the <em>

CANCELLED


<strong>1026A  21     (13/12/99)    Default by Contractor </strong>

1.     If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of the terms, 
       conditions, or obligations of the <em>Contract</em>, or if the Contractor 
       becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or has a receiving order made against 
       it, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if an 
       order is made or resolution passed for the winding up of the 
       Contractor, or if the Contractor takes the benefit of any statute 
       for the time being in force relating to bankrupt or insolvent 
       debtors, the <em>Minister</em> may, upon giving notice in writing to the 
       Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of the <em>Contract</em>.

2.     Upon the giving of such notice, the Contractor shall have no claim 
       for any further payment save as hereinafter in this section 21 
       provided, but shall remain liable to <em>Canada</em> for all loss and damage 
       which may be suffered by <em>Canada</em> by reason of the default or 
       occurrence upon which such notice was based.

3.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2 of this section, the 
       Contractor shall not be liable for any loss or damage if the failure 
       to perform the <em>Contract</em> on which the notice of termination is based 
       arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
       negligence of the Contractor.  Such causes include but are not 
       restricted to strikes, floods, fires, epidemics, act of God or of 
       the Queen's enemies.

4.     Upon termination of the <em>Contract</em> under this section, the <em>Minister</em> 
       may require the Contractor to deliver to <em>Canada</em>, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the <em>Minister</em>, any <em>finished work</em> which has 
       not been delivered and accepted prior to such termination and any 
       materials, parts, work-in-process, or tools, which the Contractor 
       has specifically acquired or produced for the fulfilment of the <em>
       Contract</em>.  Subject to the deduction of any claim which <em>Canada</em> may 
       have against the Contractor arising under the <em>Contract</em> or out of the 
       termination, <em>Canada</em> shall pay or credit to the Contractor the value 
       of all such <em>finished work</em> delivered pursuant to such direction and 
       accepted by <em>Canada</em> determined in accordance with the <em>Contract Price</em> 
       and shall pay or reimburse the Contractor the reasonable and proper <em>
       cost</em> to the Contractor of all materials, parts or work-in-process 
       delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to such direction.

5.     If after notice of termination of the <em>Contract</em> under the provisions 
       of subsection 1 of this section it is determined by the <em>Minister</em> 
       that the default of the Contractor is due to causes beyond the 
       control of the Contractor, such notice of termination shall be 
       deemed to have been issued pursuant to section 26 (Termination) of 
       these General Conditions and the rights and obligations of the 
       parties hereto shall be governed by that section.


<strong>1026A  22     (13/12/99)    No Bribe, etc. </strong>

The Contractor warrants that no bribe, gift, or other inducement has been 
paid, given, promised or offered to any official or employee of <em>Canada</em> for, 
or with a view to, the obtaining of the <em>Contract</em> by the Contractor.


<strong>1026A  23     (01/06/91)    Labour and Health Conditions </strong>

The Contractor shall comply with all labour conditions and with all health 
conditions and requirements, from time to time applicable to the <em>Work</em>.

<strong>1026A  24     (01/06/91)    Members of the House of Commons</strong>

No members of the House of Commons shall be admitted to any share or part 
of the <em>Contract</em> or to any benefit to arise therefrom.


<strong>1026A  25     (01/06/91)    Notice </strong>

Any notice to the Contractor <em>hereunder</em> shall be effectively given if sent 
by letter or by telegram, postage prepaid or with charges prepaid as the 
case may be, addressed to the Contractor at its address as given in the <em>
Contract</em> or, if no address is so given, at its address as shown by the 
records of the <em>Minister</em>.  Any notice so given shall be deemed to have been 
received by the Contractor at the time when in the ordinary course such 
letter or telegram should have reached its destination.


<strong>1026A  26     (13/12/99)    Termination</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding anything in the <em>Contract</em> contained, the <em>Minister</em> may, 
       by giving notice to the Contractor (hereinafter sometimes referred 
       to as a "termination notice"), terminate the <em>Contract</em> as regards all 
       or any part or parts of the <em>Work</em> not theretofore completed. Upon a 
       termination notice being given, the Contractor shall cease work 
       (including the manufacturing and procuring of materials for the 
       fulfilment of the <em>Contract</em>) in accordance with and to the extent 
       specified in such notice.  The <em>Minister</em> may, at any time or from 
       time to time, give one or more additional termination notices with 
       respect to any or all parts of the work not terminated by any 
       previous termination notice.
 
2.     In the event of a termination notice being given under the 
       provisions of this section, and subject as hereinafter provided

       (a)    all <em>finished work</em>, whether completed before the giving of 
              such notice or completed thereafter pursuant to such notice, 
              shall be paid for (subject to acceptance in accordance with 
              the provisions of the <em>Contract</em>) on the basis of the <em>Contract 
              Price</em>;

       (b)    in respect of work not completed before the giving of such 
              notice, and not completed thereafter pursuant to such notice, 
              the Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed the actual <em>
              cost</em> to the Contractor of such uncompleted work and to 
              receive in addition an amount representing a fair and 
              reasonable profit in respect of work done thereon. <em>Cost</em> shall 
              be determined in accordance with the provisions of the 
              Contract Cost Principles, DSS-MAS 1031-2, subject to any 
              modifications thereof which the <em>Minister</em> may consider to be 
              appropriate in the circumstances;

       (c)    subject as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection 2, 
              the Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed the amount 
              of any capital expenditures specifically authorized by the <em>
              Contract</em> or approved by the <em>Minister</em> for the purpose of the <em>
              Contract</em> (and actually made or incurred) to the extent that 
              the same (less any depreciation in respect thereof already 
              taken into account in determining <em>cost</em>) were reasonably and 
              properly incurred by the Contractor in respect of and are 
              properly apportionable to the performance of the <em>Contract</em> and 
              not included in the amounts paid or payable to the Contractor 
              in respect of <em>finished work</em>;

       (d)    if the <em>Contract</em> is exclusively a <em>Contract</em> for the making of 
              capital expenditures in respect of additional <em>equipment</em> or 
              plant additions, the foregoing paragraphs (a) to (c) 
              inclusive of this subsection 2 shall not apply but <em>Canada</em> 
              shall pay, or reimburse the Contractor for the reasonable and 
              proper <em>cost</em> to the Contractor (not previously paid by <em>Canada</em>) 
              of:

              (1)    all additional <em>equipment</em> which, prior to the giving of 
                     the termination notice, shall have been purchased, 
                     acquired or manufactured by the Contractor, or 
                     contracted for and for which the Contractor is 
                     obligated to make payments, and

              (2)    all additional <em>equipment</em> in process of manufacture by 
                     the Contractor as at the date of the giving of such 
                     notice and all work in connection with the 
                     construction of the plant addition up to the said date, 
                     including the <em>cost</em> of materials and parts contracted 
                     for by the Contractor for the purpose of such 
                     manufacture of construction and for which the 
                     Contractor is obligated to make payment.

3.     Provided always that no reimbursements shall be made in respect of 
       work which has been or may be rejected after inspection as not 
       complying with the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>. 

4.     The Contractor shall not be reimbursed any amount which, taken 
       together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to the 
       Contractor under the <em>Contract</em>, shall exceed the <em>Contract Price</em> 
       applicable to the work or the particular part thereof.

5.     Notwithstanding the provisions of any of the foregoing subsections 1 
       to 4 inclusive, the amounts which the Contractor shall be entitled 
       to be reimbursed in the event of the giving of a termination notice 
       under this section 26 shall include, subject as hereinafter provided, 
       the costs of the Contractor of and incidental to the cancellation of 
       obligations incurred by the Contractor pursuant to the termination 
       notice, the <em>cost</em> of preparing the necessary accounts and statements 
       with respect to work performed to the effective date of such 
       termination and commitments made by the Contractor with respect to 
       the terminated portions of the <em>Work</em>, wages which the Contractor is 
       obligated under any laws and regulations for the time being in force, 
       to pay to employees whose services are no longer required by reason 
       of such termination, the costs of and incidental to the taking of an 
       inventory of materials, components, work-in-process and <em>finished 
       work</em> on hand at the effective date of the termination and other 
       costs and expenses of and incidental to the termination, in whole or 
       in part, of operations under the <em>Contract</em> provided always that 
       payment and reimbursement under the provisions of this subsection 
       shall be made only to the extent that it is established to the 
       satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> that the costs and expenses aforesaid 
       were actually incurred by the Contractor and that the same are 
       reasonable and are properly attributable to the termination of the <em>
       Work</em> or the part thereof so terminated.

6.     In case of disagreement as to the amount which the Contractor is 
       entitled to be reimbursed, the matter shall be referred to the 
       Federal Court.

7.     As far as practicable, the Contractor shall place purchase orders 
       and subcontracts on terms that will enable the Contractor to 
       terminate the same upon conditions and terms similar in effect to 
       these provided in this section, and generally the Contractor shall 
       co-operate with the <em>Minister</em> and do everything reasonably within its 
       power at all times to minimize and reduce the amount of <em>Canada</em>'s 
       obligations in the event of termination <em>hereunder</em>. 
8.     Title to all materials, parts, plant, <em>equipment</em> and work-in-process 
       in respect of which reimbursement is made to the Contractor as <em>
       herein</em> provided shall, upon such reimbursement being made, pass to 
       and vest in <em>Canada</em> unless already so vested under any other 
       provision of the <em>Contract</em> and such materials, parts, plant, <em>
       equipment</em> and work-in-process shall be delivered to the order of the <em>
       Minister</em>, but the materials thus taken over will in no case be in 
       excess of what would have been required for performing the <em>Contract</em> 
       in full if no termination notice had been given.

9.     If the <em>Minister</em> is satisfied that by reason of any action taken 
       under the provisions of this section exceptional hardships have 
       resulted to the Contractor, then the <em>Minister</em> may, in his absolute 
       discretion, grant such allowance (not to include in any case, 
       however, any allowance or compensation for loss of profit) to the 
       Contractor as, in the opinion of the <em>Minister</em>, is warranted by the 
       circumstances.

10.    The Contractor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of any action or notice given by the <em>Minister</em> 
       under or pursuant to the provisions of this section to the extent in 
       this section expressly provided.


<strong>1026A  27     (01/06/91)    Accounts</strong>

The Contractor shall keep proper accounts and records of the <em>cost</em> to the 
Contractor of the work and of all expenditures or commitments made by the 
Contractor in connection therewith and such accounts and records together 
with the related invoices, receipts and vouchers shall be open to audit and 
inspection by the authorized representatives of the <em>Minister</em> (who may make 
copies thereof and take extracts therefrom) at any time until the 
expiration of six (6) years from the end of the calendar year in which the <em>
Contract</em> is terminated or completed and the Contractor shall afford all 
facilities for such audits and inspections and shall furnish the <em>Minister</em> 
and his authorized representatives with all such information as he or they 
may from time to time require with reference to such accounts, records, 
invoices, receipts and vouchers until the expiration of six (6) years from 
the end of the calendar year in which the <em>Contract</em> is terminated or 
completed, but shall preserve and keep the same available for audit and 
inspection at any time during such retention period. 


<strong>1026A  28     (01/06/91)    Foreign Exchange </strong>

Unless otherwise provided in the <em>Contract</em> or agreed to by the <em>Minister</em>, the 
Contractor shall not be entitled to any increase in the <em>Contract Price</em> by 
reason of foreign exchange fluctuations. 

<strong>1026A  29     (01/06/91)    Increased Taxes and Duties</strong>

1.     In the event of any change in any tax imposed under the <em>Excise Act</em>, 
       the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, or any duties imposed under the <em>Customs Tariff</em> 
       after the date of the <em>Contract</em> and which affects the <em>cost</em> to the 
       Contractor of the work, the <em>Contract Price</em> shall be adjusted to 
       reflect the increase or decrease in the <em>cost</em> to the Contractor.

2.     As a prerequisite of payment, the Contractor shall forward to the <em>
       Minister</em> a certified statement showing the increase or decrease in <em>
       cost</em> to the Contractor that is directly attributable to the change 
       in tax or duty.  Any price revision under this section may be 
       verified by government audit.

3      For the purpose of determining the adjustment in price referred to 
       in subsection 2 of this section resulting from any change in tax or 
       duty described in subsection 1 of this section, where such tax or 
       duty is changed after the date of submission of the Contractor's 
       tender or price proposal but public notice of such change has been 
       given by the Minister of Finance before the date of submission 
       thereof, the change of such tax or duty shall, for the purposes of 
       this section, be deemed to have occurred before the date of 
       submission of such tender or price proposal.


<strong>1026A  30     (06/06/94)    Certification - Contingency Fees</strong>

1.     The Contractor certifies that it has not directly or indirectly paid 
       or agreed to pay and covenants that it will not directly or 
       indirectly pay a contingency fee for the solicitation, negotiation 
       or obtaining of this <em>Contract</em> to any person other than an employee 
       acting in the normal course of the employee's duties.

2.     All accounts and records pertaining to payments of fees or other 
       compensation for the solicitation, obtaining or negotiation of the <em>
       Contract</em> shall be subject to the Accounts and Audit provisions of 
       the <em>Contract</em>.

3.     If the Contractor certifies falsely under this section or is in 
       default of the obligations contained therein, the <em>Minister</em> may 
       either terminate this <em>Contract</em> for default in accordance with the 
       termination for default provisions of the <em>Contract</em> or recover from 
       the Contractor by way of reduction to the <em>Contract Price</em> or 
       otherwise the full amount of the contingency fee.

4.     In this section,
 
       "<strong>contingency fee</strong>" means any payment or other compensation that is 
       contingent upon or is calculated upon the basis of a degree of 
       success in soliciting or obtaining a government contract or 
       negotiating the whole or any part of its terms;

       "<strong>employee</strong>" means a person with whom the Contractor has an employer/
       employee relationship;

       "<strong>person</strong>" includes an individual or group of individuals, a 
       corporation, a partnership, an organization and an association and, 
       without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes any
