1.     All workmen, labourers, or other persons who perform labour in the 
       construction of the work hereby contracted for, shall be paid such 
       wages as are generally accepted as current from time to time during 
       the continuance of the contract for competent workmen in the 
       district in which the work is being performed for the character or 
       class of work in which they are respectively engaged, and if there 
       be no current rate in such district, then a fair and reasonable rate.  
       In no event shall the wages for the particular classification or 
       classifications of labour concerned be less than those established 
       by statute or regulation of the province in which the work is being 
       performed.

2.     The working hours shall be those fixed by the custom of the trade as 
       respects hours in the district where the work is carried on, or if 
       there be no custom of the trade as respects hours in the district, 
       then fair and reasonable hours, except for the protection of life 
       and property, or on due cause shown to the satisfaction of the 
       Minister of Labour.

3.     Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the 
       Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so he may 
       decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages 
       for overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for 
       the purposes of wages and hours.  Immediately upon receipt of notice 
       of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the contractor 
       shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to 
       give effect to such decision.  In the event of a dispute arising as 
       to what is the current or a fair and reasonable rate of wages, or 
       what are the current hours fixed by the custom of the trade or fair 
       and reasonable hours or as to rates for overtime it shall be 
       determined by the Minister of Labour, whose decision shall be final; 
       payment may also be withheld of any moneys which would otherwise be 
       payable to the contractor until the Minister of Labour's decision 
       has been complied with.

       By the term "current wages" and the term "hours of labour fixed by 
       the custom of the trade", in the foregoing, are meant respectively 
       the standard rates of wages and hours of labour either recognized by
