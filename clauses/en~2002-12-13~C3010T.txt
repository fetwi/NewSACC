<pre>1.     Unless otherwise specified, bids shall be sought in Canadian 
       currency.

2.     The bidder may request Canada to assume the risk for exchange rate 
       fluctuation.  This option must be specifically requested at time of 
       bidding.

3.     The foreign currency component is defined as the element of the 
       price which will be directly affected by exchange rate fluctuations.  
       It could include the net price FOB foreign manufacturer's plant, 
       costs associated with applicable duty, excise tax, Goods and 
       Services Tax and/or Harmonized Sales Tax, entry fees, transportation 
       costs or delivery charges payable in a foreign currency and any 
       other charges associated with being the importer of record if they 
       originated from and are required to be paid in a foreign currency.

4.     The value in foreign funds of the foreign currency component of the 
       bid or negotiated price <strong>should be attached to the bid response, and 
       in any event, must be identified prior to contract award</strong>.  Form 
       PWGSC-TPSGC 9411, Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments (<strong><em><a href="http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca</a>
       /sos/corporate/forms-e.html</em></strong>), may be used for this purpose.  If 
       milestone payments are proposed, it is recommended that form 
       PWGSC-TPSGC 9411 shows or reflects the foreign currency component 
       associated with each milestone event.

5.     All bids are evaluated in Canadian currency.  Therefore, for 
       evaluation purposes, the rate quoted by the Bank of Canada as being 
       in effect on date of bid closing, or such other date as may be 
       specified in the bid solicitation, shall be applied as the initial 
       conversion factor for the specified currency.  (Column 3 of 
       PWGSC-TPSGC 9411 shall be completed by Public Works and Government 
       Services Canada's Contracting Authority.)

6.     Rates proposed by bidders will not be accepted for the  purposes of 
       this exchange rate adjustment provision.

7.     If there are two (2) identical bids, and provided that the bid 
       selected would still be considered the most advantageous to Canada, 
       preference will be given to the Bidder who assumes all or part of 
       the exchange rate adjustment risk, over a Bidder who does not assume 
       any of this risk.  Further, preference will be given to the Bidder 
       who assumes all of the exchange rate adjustment risk, over a bidder 
       who assumes only part of this risk.

8.     Canada shall pay exchange rate adjustment amounts in Canadian 
       currency using the prevailing rate on the date of payment by the 
       government or in accordance with the provisions, as applicable, of: 
       C3015C, Exchange Rate/Payment on delivery; C3020C, Exchange Rate/
       Milestone Payment, C3025C, Exchange Rate/Actual Costs, or C3030C, 
       Exchange Rate/Progress Claim.
