it is mandatory that bidders submit a certification with their bid.  This clause 
is to be used for single item requirements and multi-item requirements that are 
being certified on an aggregate basis.

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K4000D, Canadian Content

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is limited to Canadian Goods and/or Services as 
       defined in clause K4000D, Canadian Content Definition.

2.     The Bidder represents and warrants that, of the Goods and Services 
       being offered, no less than 80 percent of the bid price consists of 
       Canadian Goods and/or Services as defined in clause K4000D, Canadian 
       Content Definition.

3.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this bid.  Such representation and warranty 
       of Canadian content may be verified in such manner as the Minister 
       may reasonably require.

4.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       covenant, the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract 
       resulting from this bid as being in default.

5.     Failure to execute this representation and warrantee on the 
       signature block immediately following this paragraph and to include 
       it with the bid will render the bid non-responsive.
