valid, binding or affect the rights of the Parties unless it is made in 
writing by, in the case of a waiver by Canada, the authorized 
representative of Canada and, in the case of a waiver by the Contractor, 
the authorized representative of the Contractor.  The waiver by a Party of 
a breach of any term or condition of the Contract shall not prevent the

In the event of any delay in performance of the Work due to force majeure, 
the time for performance shall be extended for a period equivalent to the 
time lost by reason of the force majeure, provided, however, that the 
Contractor has advised the Minister of the event of force majeure as soon 
as the Contractor has become aware of it, and provided further that, in the 
event that the period of force majeure exceeds 30 days, the Minister may, 
by giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate the Contract, at no 
cost to Canada, as regards all or any part of the Work not completed. If a 
termination notice is given pursuant to this section, and if Canada has 
paid in advance for all or any part of the terminated work, such advance 
shall be refunded to the Minister upon written demand therefor. In this 
section, "force majeure" means fire, flood, riots, acts of the enemy, acts 
of God, government action or any other cause reasonably beyond the control

              parts of the Work will be free from all claims, liens, 
              attachments, charges or encumbrances; and 

       (d)    in the case of payment in respect of finished work, the 
              finished work has been inspected by Canada and accepted as 
              being in accordance with the Contract, including the 
              Specifications.

2.     The Minister shall notify the Contractor, within 15 days of receipt 
       of an invoice, of any inadequacy of the invoice or of the supporting 
       documentation, and where any such notice is given within that period 
       the date for payment of the amount invoiced shall be postponed until 
       the Contractor remedies the inadequacy to the satisfaction of the 
       Minister.


<strong>9601-10       10     (01/12/00)    Interest on Overdue Accounts</strong>

1.     For the purposes of this section:

       "Average Rate" means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank Rates in 
       effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during the 
       calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in 
       which payment is made, where the "Bank Rate" means the rate of 
       interest established from time to time by the Bank of Canada as the 
       minimum rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short term advances 
       to members of the Canadian Payments Association.

       "date of payment" means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn 
       by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an 
       amount due and payable;

       an amount is "due and payable" when it is due and payable by Canada 
       to the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract; and

       an amount becomes "overdue" when it is unpaid on the first day 
       following the day upon which it is due and payable.

2.     Subject to the Contract, Canada shall be liable to pay to the 
       Contractor simple interest at the Average Rate plus 3 percent per 
       annum on any amount that is overdue, from the date such amount 
       becomes overdue until the day prior to the date of payment, 
       inclusive. Interest shall be paid without notice from the Contractor.

3.     Canada shall not be liable to pay interest in accordance with this 
       section if Canada is not responsible for the delay in paying the 
       Contractor.

4.     Canada shall not be liable to pay interest on overdue advance 
       payments.

       by the Contractor in response to an invitation from the Minister.

2.     Subject to subsection 3, in the event of any change (including a new 
       imposition or repeal), on or after the date of submission of the bid, 
       of any tax, customs or other duty, charge, or any similar imposition 
       that is imposed under sales or excise tax legislation of the 
       Government of Canada and which affects the Cost to the Contractor of 
       the Work, the Contract Price shall be adjusted to reflect the 
       increase or decrease in the Cost to the Contractor.

3.     There shall be no adjustment under subsection 2 in respect of any 
       change that would increase the Cost to the Contractor of the Work if 
       public notice of the change was given before the bid submission date 
       in sufficient detail to permit the Contractor to have calculated the 
       effect on its Cost before that date.

4.     The Contractor shall forward to the Minister a certified statement 
       showing the increase or decrease in Cost to the Contractor that is 
       directly attributable to the change in the imposition. The Minister 
       may verify the increase or decrease in Cost by audit before or after 
       the Contract Price is adjusted.

5.     Notwithstanding subsections 2 to 4, no adjustment to the Contract 
       Price in respect of the Work or a part thereof shall be made for a 
       change in any imposition referred to in this section that occurs 
       after the date required by the Contract for delivery of the Work or 
       that part of the Work.


<strong>9601-10       12     (31/03/95)    Title</strong>

process or finished work, either by way of progress payments or accountable 
advances or otherwise, title in and to all materials, parts, 
work-in-process and finished work so paid for shall vest in and remain in 
Canada unless already so vested under any other provision of the Contract.

3.     Notwithstanding any vesting of title referred to in this section and

       damage to the materials, parts, work-in-process or finished work or 
       part thereof so vested shall remain with the Contractor until their 
       delivery to Canada in accordance with the Contract.  The Contractor 
       shall be liable for any loss or damage to any part of the Work 
       caused by the Contractor or any Subcontractor after such delivery.

4.     Any vesting of title referred to in subsection 2 shall not 
       constitute acceptance by Canada of the materials, parts, 
       work-in-process or finished work, and shall not relieve the 
       Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in accordance with 
       the Contract.

5.     Where title to any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished 
       work becomes vested in Canada, the Contractor shall, upon the 
       Minister's request, establish to the Minister's satisfaction that 
       the title is free and clear of all claims, liens, attachments, 
       charges or encumbrances and shall execute such conveyances thereof 
       and other instruments necessary to perfect that title as the 
       Minister may request.

6.     If the Contract is a defence Contract within the meaning of the <em>
       Defence Production Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. D-1, title to the Work or to 
       any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished work shall vest in 
       Canada free and clear of all claims, liens, attachments, charges or 
       encumbrances, and the Minister shall be entitled at any time to 
       remove, sell or dispose of it or any part of it in accordance with 
       section 20 of that Act.


<strong>9601-10       13     (01/12/92)    Warranty</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance of the Work by or on 
       behalf of Canada and without restricting any other provision of the 
       Contract or any condition, warranty or provision implied or imposed 
       by law, the Contractor warrants that, for a period of 12 months from 
       the date of delivery, or if acceptance takes place on a later date, 
       the date of acceptance, or for such other period as may be specified 
       in the written agreement between the Parties, the Work shall be free 
       from all defects in design, materials or workmanship, and shall 
       conform with the requirements of the Contract.

2.     In the event of a defect or nonconformance in any part of the Work 
       during the warranty period defined in subsection 1, the Contractor, 
       at the request of the Minister to do so, shall as soon as possible 
       repair, replace or otherwise make good at its own option and expense 
       the part of the Work found to be defective or not in conformance 
       with the requirements of the Contract.

3.     The Work or any part thereof found to be defective or non-conforming 
       shall be returned to the Contractor's plant for replacement, repair 
       or making good; provided that, when in the opinion of the Minister 
       it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location, the 
       Contractor shall carry out any necessary repair or making good of 
       the Work at that location, and shall be paid the fair and reasonable 
       Cost (including reasonable travelling and living expenses) incurred 
       in so doing, with no allowance therein by way of profit, less an 
       amount equal to the Cost of rectifying the defect or non-conformance 
       at the Contractor's plant.

4.     Canada shall pay the transportation cost associated with returning 
       any work or part thereof to the Contractor's plant pursuant to 
       subsection 3, and the Contractor shall pay the transportation cost 
       associated with forwarding the replacement or returning the Work or 
       part thereof when rectified to the delivery point specified in the 
       Contract, or such lesser cost as may be required to transport the 
       Work or part thereof to another location directed by the Technical 
       Authority.

5.     The warranties set out in subsection 1 shall apply for the remainder 
       of the warranty period to any part of the Work repaired, replaced or 
       otherwise made good pursuant to subsection 2.  All of the provisions 
       of subsections 2 to 5 of this section apply mutatis mutandis to any 
       such part of the Work that is found during that period to be 
       defective or not in conformance with the Contract.

1.     The Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Canada, the 
       Minister and their servants and agents from and against any damages, 
       costs or expenses or any claim, action, suit or other proceeding 
       which they or any of them may at any time incur or suffer as a 
       result of or arising out of:

              alleged to be caused by or suffered as a result of the 
              performance of the Work or any part thereof, except that 
              Canada and the Minister shall not claim indemnity under this 
              section to the extent that the injury, loss or damage has 
              been caused by Canada; and

       (b)    any liens, attachments, charges or other encumbrances or 
              claims upon or in respect of any materials, parts,

              of which any payment has been made by, Canada.

       Contractor under the Contract.

2      Canada shall indemnify and save harmless the Contractor and its 
       servants and agents against any claim, action, suit or other 
       proceeding for the payment of Royalties, that results from or is 
       alleged to result from

       (a)    the use by the Contractor in performing the Contract of 
              equipment, Specifications or other information not prepared

1.     Notwithstanding anything contained in the Contract, the Minister may, 
       at any time prior to the completion of the Work, by giving notice to 
       the Contractor (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a "termination 
       notice"), terminate the Contract as regards all or any part of the 
       Work not completed. Upon a termination notice being given, the 
       Contractor shall cease work (including the manufacture and procuring 
       of materials for the fulfilment of the Contract) in accordance with 
       and to the extent specified in the notice, but shall proceed to 
       complete such part or parts of the Work as are not affected by the 
       termination notice. The Minister may, at any time or from time to 
       time, give one or more additional termination notices with respect 
       to any or all parts of the Work not terminated by any previous 
       termination notice.

2.     In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to 
       subsection 1, the Contractor shall be entitled to be paid, to the 
       extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for 
       purposes of performing the Contract and to the extent that the 
       Contractor has not already been so paid or reimbursed by Canada:

       (a)    on the basis of the Contract Price, for all completed work 
              that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the 
              Contract, whether completed before, or after and in 
              compliance with the instructions contained in the termination 
              notice; 

       (b)    the Cost to the Contractor plus a fair and reasonable profit 
              thereon, for all work terminated by the termination notice 
              before completion, the Cost to the Contractor being 
              determined in accordance with the terms of the Contract and 
              with Contract Cost Principles, DSS-MAS 1031-2;

       (c)    all costs of and incidental to the termination of the Work or 
              part thereof, but not including the cost of severance 
              payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer 
              required by reason of the termination except wages that the 
              Contractor is obligated by statute to pay them and except for 
              reasonable severance payments or damages paid to employees 
              hired to perform the Contract whose hiring was expressly 
              required by the Contract or approved in writing by the 
              Minister for the purpose of the Contract.

3.     The Minister may reduce the payment in respect of any of the Work to 
       the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in meeting the 
       requirements of the Contract.

4.     Notwithstanding anything in subsection 2, the total of the amounts 
       to which the Contractor is entitled under paragraphs 2(a) and (b), 
       together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to the 
       Contractor under other provisions of the Contract, shall not exceed 
       the Contract Price or the portion thereof that is applicable to the 
       part of the Work that is terminated.

5.     In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the Contract and in the subcontracting of any of the Work, the 
       Contractor shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Minister, place 
       purchase orders and subcontracts on terms that will enable the 
       Contractor to terminate the same upon terms and conditions similar 
       in effect to those provided in this section, and generally, the 
       Contractor shall co-operate with the Minister and do everything 
       reasonably within its power at all times to minimize the amount of 
       Canada's obligations in the event of a termination under this 
       section.

6.     The Contractor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of, or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of, any action taken or termination notice 
       given by the Minister under this section, except to the extent that 
       this section expressly provides.

3.     If the Contractor certifies falsely under this section or is in 
       default of the obligations contained therein, the Minister may 
       either terminate this Contract for default in accordance with the 
       termination for default provisions of the Contract or recover from
