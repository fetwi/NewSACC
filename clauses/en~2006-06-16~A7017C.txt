<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     When specific persons have been named in the Contract as the persons 
       who must perform the Work, the Contractor must provide the services 
       of the persons so named unless the Contractor is unable to do so for 
       reasons beyond its control.

2.     If at any time the Contractor is unable to provide the services of 
       any specific person named in the Contract, it must provide a 
       replacement person with similar qualifications and experience.  The 
       Contractor must, as soon as possible, give notice to the Minister of:

       (a)    the reason for the removal of the named person from the Work;

       (b)    the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed 
              replacement person; and

       (c)    proof that the person has the required security clearance 
              granted by Canada, if applicable.

3.     The Minister may order the removal from the Work of any replacement 
       person and the Contractor must immediately remove the person from 
       the Work and must, in accordance with subsection (2), provide a 
       replacement.

4.     The fact that the Minister does not order the removal of a 
   replacement person from the Work must not relieve the Contractor from 
   its responsibility to meet the requirements of the Contract.
