<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor warrants that:

       a)     all hardware, software and/or firmware products delivered 
              individually, or

       b)     hardware, software and firmware products delivered in 
              combination as an integrated system under this Contract,

       as the case may be, shall meet the contractual requirement so as to 
       accurately and automatically process any and all date and 
       date-related data including, but not limited to calculating, 
       comparing, and sequencing and that such date-related processing will 
       take into consideration leap year calculations when used in 
       accordance with the documentation provided by the Contractor and 
       accepted by Canada.

2.     To that end, the Contractor also warrants that date-related 
       processing will not, in any way, prevent hardware, software or 
       firmware from conforming to the requirement of the Contract prior to, 
       during, or after the year 2000. Canada may, at no additional cost, 
       require the Contractor, at time of acceptance, to demonstrate 
       compliance and/or compliance techniques and test procedures it 
       intends to follow in order to comply with all of the obligations 
       contained herein.

3.     The obligations contained herein apply to the products delivered by 
       the Contractor and its subcontractor(s) involved in the performance 
       of this Contract.

4.     The warranties contained herein are separate and discrete from any 
       other warranties specified in this Contract, and are not subject to 
       any disclaimer of warranty which may be specified in this Contract, 
       its appendices, its schedules, its annexes or any document 
       incorporated in this Contract by reference. The warranties contained 
       herein are subject to any limitation of the Contractor's liability 
       specified in the Contract.

5.     The warranties contained herein shall not apply where a modification 
       has been made to a deliverable provided under this Contract by a 
       party other than the Contractor or a subcontractor or a party 
       approved in writing by either of them.

6.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set out in the 
       applicable Supplemental General Conditions, if any, under the 
       section entitled "Warranty" apply.

7.     The warranties contained herein shall have a term extending either:

       (a)    to June 30, 2000, or,
       (b)    for a period of six months following acceptance of the 
              hardware, software and/or firmware,

       whichever is the later date.
