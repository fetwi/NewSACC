<p>All enquiries must be submitted to the Contracting Authority no
later than <var>_____</var> calendar days before the bid closing
date. Enquiries received after that time may not be answered.</p>
<p>Bidders should reference as accurately as possible the numbered
item of the bid solicitation to which the enquiry relates. Care
should be taken by bidders to explain each question in sufficient
detail in order to enable Canada to provide an accurate answer.
Technical enquiries that are of a "proprietary " nature must be
clearly marked "proprietary" at each relevant item. Items
identified as proprietary will be treated as such except where
Canada determines that the enquiry is not of a proprietary nature.
Canada may edit the question(s) or may request that the Bidder do so,
so that the proprietary nature of the question(s) is eliminated and
the enquiry can be answered to all bidders. Enquiries
not submitted in a form that can be distributed to all bidders may
not be answered by Canada.</p>
