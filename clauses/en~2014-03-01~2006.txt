<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The process normally starts with a Request for Standing Offers
(RFSO) that suppliers may obtain through the Government Electronic
Tendering Service (GETS). A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> is an invitation to suppliers to
provide <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with a standing offer. The quantity of goods, level
of services and estimated expenditure specified in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> are
only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing
offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A
standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a
Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to
departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not
constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods,
services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or
several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2>01 (2014-03-01) Integrity Provisions - Offer  </h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>	Offerors must comply with the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>. In addition, offerors must respond to Requests for Standing Offers (RFSO) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>, Standing Offer (SO) and any resulting contracts, and submit offers as well as enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">	By submitting an offer, offerors confirm that they understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be issued a Standing Offer and awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications is found by Canada to be untrue in any respect, at the time of issuance of the Standing Offer (SO). If it is determined, after issuance of the <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr>, that the Offeror made a false declaration, Canada will, following a notice period, have the right to set aside the <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> and to terminate for default any resulting contracts. The Offeror will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested. The Offeror and any of the Offeror's Affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions during the period of any <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any resulting call-ups.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Offeror's Affiliates if:  <br/>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.  </li>
<li value="4">	Offerors who are incorporated, including those submitting offers as a joint venture, must provide a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Offeror. Offerors submitting offers as sole proprietorship, including those submitting offers as a joint venture, must provide the name of the owner. Offerors submitting offers as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names. <br/>

If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of offers is completed, Canada will inform the Offeror of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to provide the names within the time frame specified will render the offer non-responsive. Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for a Standing Offer to be issued. <br/>

Canada may, at any time, request that the Offeror provide properly completed and signed consent forms (Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229) for any or all individuals mentioned above within a specified time frame. Failure to provide such consent forms and associated information within the time frame provided, or failure to cooperate to the verification process will result in the offer being declared non-responsive. 

</li><li value="5">	The Offeror must diligently inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list of names of directors during this procurement process as well as during the period of any Standing Offer arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any resulting call-ups. The Offeror must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms. </li>
<li value="6">	By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility. Canada may also verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="7">	By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Standing Offer and any resulting call-ups if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
<li value="8"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

In addition, for a conviction under paragraphs a. or b. of subsection 9, following the 10-year period, a pardon or a record suspension must have been obtained, or capacities must have been restored by the Governor in Council.  The Offeror must therefore provide with its offer or promptly afterwards a copy of confirming documentation from an official source for its certification to be found true by Canada for the purpose of these Integrity Provisions.  If the documentation has not been received by the time the evaluation of offers is completed, Canada will inform the Offeror of a time frame within which to provide the information.  Failure to comply within the time frame specified will render the offer non-responsive. </li>
<li value="9">	By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates have been convicted of an offence or received a conditional or an absolute discharge under any of the following provisions, unless the time period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, has elapsed:  

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>), subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="2">section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor subscribing to election fund</em>), section 124 (<em>Selling or Purchasing Office</em>), section 380 (<em>Fraud</em>) for fraud committed against Her Majesty or section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="3">section 119 (<em>Bribery of judicial officers, etc</em>), section 120 (<em>Bribery of officers</em>), section 346 (<em>Extortion</em>), sections 366 to 368 (<em>Forgery and other offences resembling forgery</em>), section 382 (<em>Fraudulent manipulation of stock exchange transactions</em>), section 382.1 (<em>Prohibited insider trading</em>), section 397 (<em>Falsification of books and documents</em>), section 422 (<em>Criminal breach of contract</em>), section 426 (<em>Secret commissions</em>), section 462.31 (<em>Laundering proceeds of crime</em>) or sections 467.11 to 467.13 (<em>Participation in activities of criminal organization</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="4">section 45 (<em>Conspiracies, agreements or arrangements between competitors</em>), section 46 (<em>Foreign directives</em>), section 47 (<em>Bid rigging</em>), section 49 (<em>Agreements or arrangements of federal financial institutions</em>), section 52 (<em>False or misleading representation</em>), section 53 (<em>Deceptive notice of winning a prize</em>) of the <cite>Competition Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="5">section 239 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="6">section 327 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Excise Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="7">section 3 (<em>Bribing a foreign public official</em>), section 4 (<em>Accounting</em>), or section 5 (<em>Offence committed outside Canada</em>) of the Corruption of <cite>Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="8">section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</cite>.</li>
</ol>

The Offeror also certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a. or b. are to receive any benefit under a Standing Offer arising from this Request for Standing Offers and any resulting call-ups, unless a pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, as defined in the Time Period subsection.

</li><li value="10"><dfn>Foreign Offences</dfn><br/>
The Offeror also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions.  Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to the Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council.  
</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Subcontractors</dfn><br/>
The Offeror must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no less favourable to Canada than those imposed in the resulting contract.</li>
<li value="12"><dfn>Preventive Measures associated with the Time Period<br/>
In cases where the period (as defined in the Time Period subsection), for a conviction, or a conditional or an absolute discharge of the Offeror or any of the Offeror's Affiliates has elapsed, then the Offeror must also certify for itself and for its Affiliates that measures have been diligently put in place in order to avoid the reoccurrence of such convictions or reprehensible actions. </dfn></li>
<li value="13"><dfn>Public Interest Exception</dfn><br/>
Offerors understand that Canada may issue a Standing Offer with an offeror where the Offeror or the Offeror's Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge for an offence specified in these Integrity Provisions, when required to do so by law or legal proceedings, or when Canada in its sole discretion considers it necessary to the public interest for reasons which include, but are not limited to: 
<ul>
<li>no one else is capable of performing the contract;</li>
<li>emergency;</li>
<li>national security;</li>
<li>health and safety;</li>
<li>economic harm;</li>
</ul>

If all offers are found non-responsive for reason of a listed relevant conviction or act, then Canada may invoke the public interest exception, as described in the paragraph above.  In such cases, only offers containing a declaration concerning a relevant offence or act will be further considered.  Canada may also elect to procure outside of the present process.  In all cases, Canada reserves the right to impose additional conditions or measures to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.  

</li><li value="14"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
For governments, as well as entities controlled by a government, including Crown corporations, the present Integrity Provisions are reduced to complying with article 750 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, the <cite>Government Contracts Regulations</cite> and the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>.</li>

<h2>02 (2012-03-02)  Procurement Business Number</h2>

Number (PBN) before issuance of a standing offer. Suppliers may

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">An offer delivered to the specified Bid Receiving
Unit after the closing date and time but before the standing offer

<abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> for the purposes of delayed offers. The only pieces of evidence

<p>It is the responsibility of the Offeror to allow sufficient time
to obtain customs clearance, where required, before the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
closing date and time. Delays related to the obtaining of customs
clearance cannot be construed as "undue delay in the mail" and will
not be accepted as a delayed offer under section 07.</p>
<h2>10 (2007-05-25)  Legal Capacity</h2>
<p>The Offeror must have the legal capacity to contract. If the
Offeror is a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate

<li value="1">Canada may reject an offer where any of the following
circumstances is present:

renders the Offeror ineligible to submit an offer for the
requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the
offer, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under
the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which would render that employee or

</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject an offer pursuant to a
provision of subsection 1. (f), the Standing Offer Authority will
so inform the Offeror and provide the Offeror ten (10) days within
which to make representations, before making a final decision on
the offer rejection.</li>
<li value="3">Canada reserves the right to apply additional scrutiny, in particular, when multiple offers are received in response to a request for standing offers from a single offeror or a joint venture. Canada reserves the right to:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">reject any or all of the offers submitted by a single offeror or joint venture if their inclusion in the evaluation has the effect of prejudicing the integrity and fairness of the process, or;</li>
<li value="2">reject any or all of the offers submitted by a single offeror or joint venture if their inclusion in the procurement process would distort the solicitation evaluation, and would cause a result that would not reasonably have been expected under prevailing market conditions and/or would not provide good value to Canada.</li>

<h2>13 (2014-03-01)  Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In conducting its evaluation of the offers, Canada
may, but will have no obligation to, do the following:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">seek clarification or verification from offerors
regarding any or all information provided by them with respect to
the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>;</li>
<li value="2">contact any or all references supplied by offerors to
verify and validate any information submitted by them;</li>
<li value="3">request, before issuance of any standing offer,
specific information with respect to offerors' legal status;</li>
<li value="4">conduct a survey of offerors' facilities and/or
examine their technical, managerial, and financial capabilities to
determine if they are adequate to meet the requirements of the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>;</li>
<li value="5">correct any error in the extended pricing of offers
by using unit pricing and any error in quantities in offers to
reflect the quantities stated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>; in the case of error in
the extension of prices, the unit price will govern.</li>
<li value="6">verify any information provided by offerors through
independent research, use of any government resources or by
contacting third parties;</li>
<li value="7">interview, at the sole costs of offerors, any offeror
and/or any or all of the resources proposed by offerors to fulfill
the requirement of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Offerors will have the number of days specified in
the request by the Standing Offer Authority to comply with any
request related to any of the above items. Failure to comply with
the request may result in the offer being declared
non-responsive.</li>
</ol>
<h2>17 (2007-11-30)  Joint Venture</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A joint venture is an association of two or more
parties who combine their money, property, knowledge, expertise or
other resources in a single joint business enterprise, sometimes
referred as a consortium, to submit an offer together on a
requirement. Offerors who submit an offer as a joint venture must
indicate clearly that it is a joint venture and provide the
following information:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the name of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li value="2">the Procurement Business Number of each member of the
joint venture;</li>
<li value="3">the name of the representative of the joint venture,
i.e. the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf,
if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the information is not clearly provided in the
offer, the Offeror must provide the information on request from the
Standing Offer Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The offer and any resulting standing offer must be
signed by all the members of the joint venture unless one member
has been appointed to act on behalf of all members of the joint
venture. The Standing Offer Authority may, at any time, require
each member of the joint venture to confirm that the representative
has been appointed with full authority to act as its representative
for the purposes of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any resulting standing offer. If a
standing offer is issued to a joint venture, all members of the
joint venture will be jointly and severally or solidarily liable
for the performance of any contract resulting from a call-up
against the standing offer.</li>
</ol>
<h2>18 (2012-03-02)  Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, offerors are advised that Canada may reject an offer in
the following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Offeror, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> or in any situation of
conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Offeror, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> that was not available to other
offerors and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to
give the Offeror an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by an offeror who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This offeror remains however subject to the
criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject an offer under this
section, the Standing Offer Authority will inform the Offeror and
provide the Offeror an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Offerors who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Standing Offer Authority
before the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> closing. By submitting an offer, the Offeror
represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of
interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Offeror acknowledges
that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a
conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict
of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
</ol>
<h2>19 (2008-12-12)  Entire Requirement</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> contains all the requirements relating to the request
for offers. Any other information or documentation provided to or
obtained by an offeror from any source are not relevant. Offerors
should not assume that practices used under previous contracts will
continue, unless they are described in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>. Offerors should
also not assume that their existing capabilities meet the
requirements of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> simply because they have met previous
requirements.</p>
