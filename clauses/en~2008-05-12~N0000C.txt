<pre>1.     This section applies despite any other provision of the Contract and 
       replaces the section of the general conditions entitled "Liability".  
       Any reference in this article to damages caused by the Contractor 
       also includes damages caused by its employees, as well as its 
       subcontractors, agents, and representatives, and any of their 
       employees.

2.     <strong>First Party Liability of the Contractor to Canada:</strong><strong></strong>

       (a)    Whether the claim is based in contract, tort, or another 
              cause of action, the Contractor is fully liable for all 
              damages to Canada, including indirect, special or 
              consequential damages, caused by the Contractor's performance 
              or failure to perform the Contract that relate to:
              (i)    any infringement of intellectual property rights;

              (ii)   any breach of confidentiality; 

              (iii)  any breach of warranty obligations; and

              (iv)   physical injury, including death.

       (b)    The Contractor is liable for all direct damages affecting 
              real or personal property owned, possessed, or occupied by 
              Canada.

       (c)    The Contractor is liable for all direct damages relating to 
              any encumbrance or claim relating to any portion of the Work 
              for which Canada has made any payment.

       (d)    The Contractor is also liable, up to __________, for any 
              other direct damages to Canada in any way relating to the 
              Contract, including all the costs to Canada associated with 
              reprocuring the Work from another party if the Contract is 
              terminated for default. These costs include any increase in 
              the price payable for the Work.

       (e)    If Canada's records or data are harmed as a result of the 
              performance of or failure to perform the Work, the 
              Contractor's only liability is, at the Contractor's own 
              expense, to restore Canada's records and data using the most 
              recent back-up kept by Canada.

3.     <strong>Third Party Claims</strong>: Each Party agrees that it is fully liable for 
       any damages that it causes to any third party in connection with the 
       Contract, regardless of whether the third party makes its claim 
       against Canada or the Contractor.  If Canada is required, as a 
       result of joint and several liability, to pay a third party in 
       respect of damages caused by the Contractor, the Contractor must 
       reimburse Canada for that amount.  However, the Contractor is not 
       liable for reimbursing Canada for any special, indirect or 
       consequential damages that Canada is required by a court to pay to a 
       third party as a result of joint and several liability.
