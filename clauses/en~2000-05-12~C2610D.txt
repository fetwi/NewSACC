<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>When the Department of National Defence is the importer, use the following 
clause in bid solicitations and contracts for defence supplies valued at 
C$250,000 or more where the item or components of the item are imported under 
the Customs Tariff respecting the remission of customs duties. Contracting 
officers should request prices with customs duty identified as a separate item.
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     As the goods to be supplied under the Contract are defence supplies, 
       customs duties on importation to Canada may be remitted under the 
       Tariff Item number 9982.00.00 of the Schedule to the <em>Customs Tariff</em>.

2.     Remission of customs duty payable may be granted under the Tariff 
       Item 9982.00.00 when the total contract value of the defence 
       supplies is C$250,000 or more.  This reflects the import value of 
       the goods plus the duty that would be applicable in the absence of 
       the <em>Customs Tariff</em>.

3.     The Department of National Defence will be responsible for 
       prearranging remission on importation or for paying customs duties 
       on importation and applying to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency for 
       a refund.  The importer is responsible for applying to Department of 
       Public Works and Government Services in good time for the 
       certification required by the <em>Customs Tariff</em>.
