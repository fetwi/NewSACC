<li value="1">Proponents must comply with the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external"><cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite></a>. In addition to the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external"><cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite></a>, proponents must a) respond to bid solicitations in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, b) accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the bid solicitations and resulting contracts, c) submit bids and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.
</li>
<li value="2">Proponents further understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada. If it is determined, after contract award, that the Proponent made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to terminate the Contract for default. The Proponent will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested. The Proponent and any of the Proponent's affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any contract arising from this bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="3">
<p>
For the purpose of this section, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies, and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals, and directors, are Proponent's affiliates if: 
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in this section which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.
</p>
</li>
<li value="4">
<p>
Proponents who are incorporated, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide with their bid or promptly thereafter a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Proponent.  Proponents bidding as sole proprietorship, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide with their bid or promptly thereafter the name of the owner.  Proponents bidding as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.  If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of bids is completed, Canada will inform the Proponent of a time frame within which to provide the information.  Failure to comply will render the bid non-responsive.  Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for contract award.
</p>
<p>
Canada may, at any time, request that a Proponent provide properly completed and Signed Consent Forms (<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/forms/formulaires-forms-eng.html#f229" rel="external">Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229</a>) for any or all individuals aforementioned within the time specified.  Failure to provide such Consent Forms within the time period provided will result in the bid being declared non-responsive.
</p>
</li>
<li value="5">The Proponent must diligently maintain an up-to-date list of names by informing Canada in writing of any change occurring during the validity period of the bid as well as during the period of any contract arising from this bid solicitation. The Proponent must also, when so requested, provide Canada with the corresponding Consent Forms.  </li>
<li value="6">By submitting a bid, the Proponent certifies that it is aware, and that its affiliates are aware, that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility. Canada may also verify the information provided by the Proponent, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="7">By submitting a bid, the Proponent certifies that neither the Proponent nor any of the Proponent's affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Contract if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-12.4/" rel="external"><cite>Lobbying Act</cite></a>.</li>
<li value="8">

<li value="6">comply with all other requirements set out in the
<abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Phase One Proposal Evaluation and Rating</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Each responsive proposal received is reviewed,
evaluated and rated by a Public Works and Government Services
Canada (PWGSC) Evaluation Board in accordance with the evaluation
criteria, components and weight factors set out in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>. Upon
completion of the evaluation, an initial rating (Phase One Rating)
is assigned to the proposal. Phase One Ratings are recorded for
subsequent incorporation in the final proposal evaluation and
rating.</li>
<li value="2">Each Proponent submitting a responsive Phase One
proposal is notified in writing of its Phase One Rating and, in
addition, is provided with the following:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">an alphabetic list (normally five names) of
Proponents with the highest Phase One Ratings;</li>
<li value="2">a list of all Phase One Ratings attained (ratings are
not linked to Proponents);</li>
<li value="3">a date, time, and location for a Phase Two briefing
meeting, if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the date and time for receipt of Phase Two proposals,
and any supplementary instructions, terms, conditions or addenda
which may be applicable to Phase Two proposal preparation and
submission.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Proponents that submitted non-responsive Phase One
proposals are notified accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.3 Phase Two Proposal</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Phase Two proposals are prepared and submitted after
Proponents have been advised of the results of evaluation of Phase
One proposals. All Proponents submitting responsive proposals in
Phase One, regardless of their Phase One Ratings, are eligible to
prepare and submit a Phase Two proposal. The decision to continue
participating in the selection procedure in Phase Two is a decision
to be made by each eligible Proponent.</li>
<li value="2">In Phase Two, a Proponent may not substitute or
delete any member of the Consultant Team identified in the Phase
One proposal without the consent of Canada.</li>
<li value="3">Phase Two proposals are submitted following a
"two-envelope" procedure, in which Proponents submit the
"technical" component of their proposal in one envelope and the
proposed price of the services (price proposal) in a second
envelope.</li>
<li value="4">The information that Proponents are required to
provide is set out in detail throughout the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.4 Phase Two Proposal Evaluation and Final Rating</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Technical components of Phase Two proposals are
reviewed, evaluated and rated by a <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Evaluation Board in
accordance with the criteria, components and weight factors set out
in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>. Upon completion of the evaluation, Phase Two Technical
Ratings are established.</li>
<li value="2">Phase One Rating and Phase Two Technical Rating are
combined to establish a Combined Technical Score. Proposals
achieving the minimum Combined Technical Score specified in the
Submission Requirements and Evaluation section of the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr> are
further considered.</li>
<li value="3">The price envelopes of all responsive proposals are
opened upon completion of the technical evaluation. When there are
three or more responsive proposals, an average price is determined
by adding all the price proposals together and dividing the total
by the number of price proposals opened. This calculation will not
be conducted when one or two responsive proposals are
received.</li>
<li value="4">All price proposals which are greater than 25 percent
above the average price will cause their respective complete
proposals to be set aside and receive no further
consideration.</li>
<li value="5">The remaining price proposals are rated as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">The lowest price proposal receives a Price Rating of
100.</li>
<li value="2">The second, third, fourth and fifth lowest prices
receive Price Ratings of 80, 60, 40, and 20 respectively. All other
price proposals receive a Price Rating of 0.</li>
<li value="3">On the rare occasion where two (or more) price
proposals are identical, these price proposals receive the same
rating and the corresponding number of following ratings are
skipped.</li>
<li value="4">The Price Rating is multiplied by a predetermined
percentage factor to establish a Price Score.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="6">A price proposal in excess of any maximum funding
limit, when this limit has been set in the Supplementary
Instructions to Proponents, may result in disqualification of the
complete proposal.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.5 Total Score</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The total overall score (Total Score) assigned to
each Proponent's complete proposal is calculated as the aggregate
of:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Phase One Score (Phase One proposal on
qualifications and experience), and</li>
<li value="2">the Phase Two Technical Score (first envelope of
Phase Two proposal), and</li>
<li value="3">the Price Score (second envelope of Phase Two
proposal).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Proponent receiving the highest Total Score is
the first entity that the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Evaluation Board will recommend for the
provision of the required services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.6 Notification</h3>
<p><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> normally expects to advise in writing unsuccessful
Proponents within one week after <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has entered into a
contractual arrangement with the successful Proponent.</p>

Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive bid process,

Limitation of Submissions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A Proponent may not submit more than one proposal.
This limitation also applies to the persons or entities in the case
of a joint venture. If more than one proposal is received from a

agreeing to share the profits and the losses and each having some
degree of control over the enterprise.</li>
<li value="3">An arrangement whereby Canada contracts directly with
a prime consultant who may retain sub-consultants or specialist
consultants to perform portions of the services is not a joint
venture arrangement. A sub-consultant or specialist consultant may,
therefore, be proposed as part of the Consultant Team by more than
one Proponent.  The Proponent warrants that it has written permission from such sub-consultant or specialist consultant to propose their services in relation to the services to be performed.</li>
<li value="4">Notwithstanding subsection 3 above, in order to avoid any conflict of interest, or any perception of conflict of interest, a Proponent shall not include in its submission another Proponent as a member of its consultant team, as a sub-consultant or specialist consultant.</li>
<li value="5">The Phase Two portion of the proposal must be made in
the same name as the person(s) or entity(ies) named as the
Proponent in the Phase One portion. Proponents must utilize, in the
preparation of their Phase Two proposal, the same Consultant Team,
sub-consultants, specialist consultants and individuals named in
the Phase One proposal.</li>
<li value="6">Any joint venture entered into for the provision of
professional services or other services must be in full compliance

Territory in which the project is located.</li>
<li value="2">By virtue of submission of a proposal, the Proponent
certifies that the Proponent's Consultant Team and Key Personnel
are in compliance with the requirements of subsection 1 above. The
Proponent acknowledges that <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> reserves the right to verify any

ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion of the

<ol type="1">

To determine the Proponent's financial capability, the Contracting Authority may, by written notice to the Proponent, require the submission of some or all of the financial information detailed below during the evaluation of proposals. The Proponent must provide the following information to the Contracting Authority within fifteen (15) working days of the request or as specified by the Contracting Authority in the notice:

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Audited financial statements, if available, or the unaudited financial statements (prepared by the Proponent's outside accounting firm, if available, or prepared in-house if no external statements have been prepared) for the Proponent's last three fiscal years, or for the years that the Proponent has been in business if this is less than three years (including, as a minimum, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Retained Earnings, the Income Statement and any notes to the statements).
</li>
<li value="2"> If the date of the financial statements in (a) above is more than five months before the date of the request for information by the Contracting Authority, the Proponent must also provide, unless this is prohibited by legislation for public companies, the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement), as of two months before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information.
</li>
<li value="3">  	If the Proponent has not been in business for at least one full fiscal year, the following must be provided:


<ol type="i">
<li value="1">   	the opening Balance Sheet on commencement of business (in the case of a corporation, the date of incorporation); and
</li>
<li value="2">  	the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement) as of two months before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">   	A certification from the Chief Financial Officer or an authorized signing officer of the Proponent that the financial information provided is complete and accurate.
</li>
<li value="5">  	A confirmation letter from all of the financial institution(s) that have provided short-term financing to the Proponent outlining the total of lines of credit granted to the Proponent and the amount of credit that remains available and not drawn upon as of one month prior to the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information.</li>

<li value="2">	If the Proponent is a joint venture, the financial information required by the Contracting Authority must be provided by each member of the joint venture.
</li>
<li value="3">	If the Proponent is a subsidiary of another company, then any financial information in 1. (a) to (e) above required by the Contracting Authority must be provided by the ultimate parent company. Provision of parent company financial information does not by itself satisfy the requirement for the provision of the financial information of the Proponent, and the financial capability of a parent cannot be substituted for the financial capability of the Proponent itself unless an agreement by the parent company to sign a Parental Guarantee, as drawn up by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), is provided with the required information.
</li>
<li value="4"> 	Financial Information Already Provided to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>: The Proponent is not required to resubmit any financial information requested by the Contracting Authority that is already on file at <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with the Contract Cost Analysis, Audit and Policy Directorate of the Policy, Risk, Integrity and Strategic Management Sector, provided that within the above-noted time frame:

</li>
<li value="2">the Proponent authorizes the use of the information for this requirement.
</li>
</ol>

It is the Proponent's responsibility to confirm with the Contracting Authority that this information is still on file with <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.
</li>
<li value="5">   	Other Information: Canada reserves the right to request from the Proponent any other information that Canada requires to conduct a complete financial capability assessment of the Proponent.
</li>
<li value="6">  	Confidentiality: If the Proponent provides the information required above to Canada in confidence while indicating that the disclosed information is confidential, then Canada will treat the information in a confidential manner as permitted by the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/" rel="external">Access to Information Act</a></cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. A-1, Section 20(1) (b) and (c).
</li>
<li value="7">  	Security: In determining the Proponent's financial capability to fulfill this requirement, Canada may consider any security the Proponent is capable of providing, at the Proponent's sole expense (for example, an irrevocable letter of credit from a registered financial institution drawn in favour of Canada, a performance guarantee from a third party or some other form of security, as determined by Canada).
</li>
<li value="8">	In the event that a proposal is found to be non-compliant on the basis that the Proponent is considered not to be financially capable of performing the subject requirement, official notification shall be provided to the Proponent.

Consultant during and upon completion of the services shall be

following criteria: Design, Quality of Results, Management, Time
and Cost. Should the Consultant's performance be considered

proposal. Costs associated with preparing and submitting a
proposal, as well as any costs incurred by the Proponent associated

Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, Proponents are advised that Canada may reject a proposal
in the following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of
interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available
to other Proponents and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or
appear to give the Proponent an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a Proponent who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in
itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage
or creating a conflict of interest. This Proponent remains however
subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a proposal under this
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Proponent and
provide the Proponent an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Proponents who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a proposal, the Proponent
represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of
interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Proponent
acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to
determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an
appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
</ol>

Proponent or Potential Proponent shall have any claim for any
compensation of any kind whatsoever in relation to this <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>, or any
aspect of the procurement process, and by submitting a proposal
each Proponent shall be deemed to have agreed that it has no
claim.</p>
