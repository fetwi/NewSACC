       or materials, notify the Minister in writing of such proposed 
       subcontracts and shall furnish such particulars thereof as the 
       Minister may require.  The Contract shall not be assigned nor any of 
       the Work sublet without the prior written consent of the Minister 
       and any assignment or subletting made without such consent shall be 
       of no effect provided that, unless the Contract or the Minister

       Work as is customary in the carrying out of similar contracts.  No

       its obligations under the Contract or impose any liability upon 
       Canada or the Minister to an assignee or subcontractor, unless 
       otherwise agreed to by the Minister.

2.     Unless otherwise agreed to by the Minister in any assignment or 
       subletting, the Contractor agrees to bind each assignee or 
       subcontractor by the terms of the general conditions, the 
       supplemental general conditions, if any, the labour conditions and

       firm or corporation other than the Contractor, unless Canada 
       consents thereto.

of every kind required for the performance of this Contract, there shall be 
deducted from the gross cost thereof all trade discounts, rebates, 
refundable taxes and duties, credits, commissions and other allowances as 
aforesaid.  Such benefits lost through no fault or neglect on the part of 
the Contractor shall not be deducted from gross costs.

<strong>1026B  05     (1991-06-01)  Conduct of the Work</strong>

1.     The Contractor agrees to carry out the Work diligently and to 
       provide efficient supervision and inspection thereof and that the

       conformity with the specifications, drawings, models or samples, if 
       any.

2.     No materials or parts shall be used or processed and no finished 
       work shall be submitted for acceptance or shall be delivered unless 
       or until approved by the Contractor's inspection staff and, wherever 
       practicable, marked with an approval stamp satisfactory to the 
       Inspector.  The Contractor shall keep proper and adequate inspection 
       records which shall at all times be open to examination by the 
       Inspector who may make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom.

3.     The Minister and the Inspector shall have access to the Work at all 
       times and to the plant and premises where any part of the work is 
       being carried on, and may make such inspections and tests of the 
       Work and of parts, materials and work in process as the Minister or 
       the Inspector may think fit.  he Contractor shall provide all 
       assistance and facilities, test pieces and samples which the

       out of any such inspections and any such tests as aforesaid and 
       shall forward such test pieces and samples to such person or 
       location as the Minister or the Inspector may direct.  The 
       Contractor shall provide the Minister and the Inspector with such 
       accommodation as they may require for the purpose of such 
       inspections and any such tests and for the exercise of any other 
       powers conferred upon them hereunder.

       or determination of any differences arising under the Contract,

upon demand. 

<strong>1026B  07     (1991-06-01)  Inspection</strong>

All Work shall be subject to inspection by the Inspector prior to 
acceptance.  Should the Work be defective in materials or workmanship or 
otherwise not be in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, the 
Inspector shall have the right to reject the Work or to require its 
correction.  Inspection by the Inspector either at the plant of the 
Contractor or of any of its subcontractors shall not relieve the Contractor 
from responsibility for defects or other failure to meet the requirements 
of the Contract.  The Contractor agrees to accept and be bound by the 
Inspector's interpretation of the meaning of the specifications.

<strong>1026B  08     (2000-12-01)  Title and Acceptance</strong>

Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, title to the Work or any part 
thereof shall vest in Canada upon delivery to the consignee and acceptance 
thereof by the consignee.  Acceptance by the consignee of the Work or any 
part thereof shall be deemed to be acceptance thereof by Canada.

<strong>1026B  09     (2004-12-10)  Warranty</strong>

restricting any other term of the Contract or any condition, warranty or 
provision implied or imposed by law, the Contractor, if requested by the 
Minister to do so at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of 
delivery, shall:

(a)    replace or make good at its own expense any finished work, excluding 
       Government Issue incorporated therein, which becomes defective or 
       which fails to conform to contract requirements as a result of 
       faulty or inefficient manufacture, material or workmanship

(b)    deliver such finished work free from all defects to the delivery 
       point specified in the Contract, unless otherwise agreed to by the 
       Minister;

provided that where, in the opinion of the Minister, it is not expedient to 
remove such defective finished work from its location, the Contractor shall 
replace or make good the defective finished work at such location, and 
shall be paid the actual cost incurred in so doing (including reasonable 
travelling and living expenses) with no allowance thereon by way of 
overhead or profit, less a sum equivalent to the cost of making good the 
defective finished work had it been made good at the Contractor's plant.

<strong>1026B  10     (1999-12-13)  Government Issue</strong>

1.     All items comprised in any Government Issue shall be used by the 
       Contractor solely for the purposes of the Contract and shall always 
       be and remain the property of Canada and wherever feasible the 
       Contractor shall maintain adequate accounting records of all 
       Government Issue and shall mark the same as being Canada's property.

2.     All Government Issue (except such as are installed or incorporated 
       in the Work) shall be returned to Canada upon demand, in the same 
       condition as when supplied to the Contractor provided that the 
       Contractor shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting 
       from ordinary wear and tear or causes beyond the Contractor's 
       control.

       from any other materials, articles or things which are the property 
       of Canada, shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, 
       remain the property of Canada and shall be disposed of only as 
       prescribed by the Minister.

<strong>1026B  11     (1991-06-01)  Spoilage and Defective Work</strong>

The Contractor shall carry out the Work as economically as possible and 
shall avoid waste and spoilage. If the character and value of any spoiled 
and wasted materials, or defective Work, in the opinion of the Minister 
constitutes mismanagement on the part of the Contractor, the cost of the 
spoiled and wasted materials and the cost of re-working the defective Work 
to the extent directed by the Minister shall not be considered as part of 
the cost of the Work and the Contractor shall not be reimbursed therefor.

<strong>1026B  12     (1999-12-13)  Care of Crown Property</strong>

Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, no insurance shall be carried 
by the Contractor on any property, title to which is vested in Canada,

property of Canada.  The Contractor shall take reasonable and proper care 
of all property, title to which is vested in Canada, while the same is in, 
on or about the plant and premises of the Contractor or otherwise in his 
possession or subject to his control and shall be responsible for any loss 
or damage resulting from his failure to do so other than loss or damage 
caused by ordinary wear and tear. 

<strong>1026B  13     (1991-06-01)  Time of Essence</strong>

Time shall be deemed to be of the essence of the Contract provided that the 
time for completing any of the Work which has been or is likely to be 
delayed by reason of force majeure or other cause beyond the reasonable 
control of the Contractor shall be extended by a period equal to the length 
of the delay so caused, provided that prompt notice in writing of the 
occurrence causing or likely to cause such delay is given to the Minister.

<strong>1026B  14     (1991-06-01)  Accounts</strong>

The Contractor shall keep proper accounts and records of the cost to the 
Contractor of the Work and of all expenditures or commitments made by the 
Contractor in connection therewith and such accounts and records together 
with the related invoices, receipts and vouchers shall be open to audit and 
inspection by the authorized representatives of the Minister (who may make 
copies thereof and take extracts therefrom) at any time until the 
expiration of six (6) years from the end of the calendar year in which the 
Contract is terminated or completed and the Contractor shall afford all 
facilities for such audits and inspections and shall furnish the Minister 
and his authorized representatives with all such information as he or they 
may from time to time require with reference to such accounts, records, 
invoices, receipts and vouchers.  The Contractor shall not, without the 
consent of the Minister, dispose of any such accounts, records, invoices, 
receipts and vouchers until the expiration of six (6) years from the end of 
the calendar year in which the Contract is terminated or completed, but 
shall preserve and keep the same available for audit and inspection at any 
time during such retention period. 

<strong>1026B  15     (2000-12-01)  Security and Protection of Work</strong>

1.     The Contractor shall keep confidential all information provided to 
       the Contractor by or on behalf of Canada in connection with the Work, 
       and all information developed by the Contractor as part of the Work, 
       and shall not disclose any such information to any person without 
       the written permission of the Minister, except that the Contractor 
       may disclose to a subcontractor, authorized in accordance with this 
       Contract, information necessary to the performance of the 
       subcontract. This section does not apply to any information that:

       (a)    is publicly available from a source other than the Contractor; 
              or

       (b)    is or becomes known to the Contractor from a source other 
              than Canada, except any source that is known to the 
              Contractor to be under an obligation to Canada not to 
              disclose the information.

2.     When the Contract, the Work, or any information referred to in 
       subsection 1 is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL or 
       PROTECTED by Canada, the Contractor shall, at all times, take all 
       measures reasonably necessary for the safeguarding of the material 
       so identified, including those set out in the Department of Public 
       Works and Government Services Industrial Security Manual and its 
       supplements and any other instructions issued by the Minister.

3.     Without limiting the generality of subsections 1 and 2, when the 
       Contract, the Work, or any information referred to in subsection 1 
       is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL or PROTECTED by 
       Canada, the Minister shall be entitled to inspect the Contractor's 
       premises and the premises of a subcontractor at any tier for 
       security purposes at any time during the term of the Contract, and 
       the Contractor shall comply with, and ensure that any such 
       subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by the 
       Minister dealing with the material so identified, including any 
       requirement that employees of the Contractor or of any such 
       subcontractor execute and deliver declarations relating to

       payments analogous to royalties for, and also claims for damages

       industrial design, or copyright by the Contractor in, or the

       thereof.

2.     Canada shall indemnify the Contractor against claims, actions or 
       proceedings for the payment of royalties in respect of anything, the

       indemnity shall apply only to the Contract.

3.     Except as provided in subsection 2 of this section, and subject as 
       hereinafter provided, the Contractor shall indemnify Canada against 
       claims, actions, or proceedings for the payment of royalties in 
       respect of the carrying out of the Contract, or in respect of the 
       use of or disposal by or for Canada of articles and supplies 
       furnished hereunder.

4.     The Contractor shall forthwith notify the Minister of all royalties 
       which the Contractor or any of its subcontractors will or may be 
       obligated to pay or proposes to pay for or in respect of the 
       carrying out of the Contract, and the basis thereof, and the parties 
       to whom the same are payable, and shall from time to time promptly 
       advise the Minister of any and all claims or arrangements made or 
       proposed which would or might result in further or different 
       payments by way of royalties being made by the Contractor or any of 
       its subcontractors.

5.     If and to the extent that the Minister so directs, the Contractor 
       shall not pay, and shall direct its subcontractors not to pay any 
       royalties in respect of the carrying out of the Contract except with 
       the consent in writing of the Minister and subject to such 
       conditions as the Minister may impose.

6.     From and after the giving of any such direction, and subject to 
       compliance by the Contractor with the foregoing provisions, Canada 
       shall relieve and indemnify the Contractor from and against all 
       claims, actions or proceedings for payment of such royalties as are 
       covered by such direction.

1.     If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of the terms, 
       conditions, covenants or obligations of the Contract, or if the 
       Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or has a receiving order 
       made against it, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, 
       or if an order is made or resolution passed for the winding up of 
       the Contractor, or if the Contractor takes the benefit of any 
       statute for the time being in force relating to bankrupt or 
       insolvent debtors, the Minister may, by giving notice in writing to 
       the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of the Contract.  In 
       such event, the Contractor shall not be entitled to the payment of 
       any fee or any portion thereof with respect to any of the Work not 
       completed by the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the 
       Contract at the time of the said notice in writing to the Contractor.

2.     If after notice of termination of the Contract under the provisions 
       of subsection 1 of this section, it is determined by the Minister 
       that the default of the Contractor is due to causes beyond the 
       control of the Contractor, such notice of termination shall be 
       deemed to have been issued pursuant to section 25 of these general 
       conditions, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto 
       shall be governed by that section.

3.     Upon termination of the Contract under this section, the Minister 
       may require the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the Minister, any finished work which has 
       not been delivered and accepted prior to such termination and any 
       materials, parts, work in process or tools which the Contractor has 
       specifically acquired or produced for the fulfilment of the Contract. 
       Canada shall pay the Contractor for all such finished work delivered 
       pursuant to such direction and accepted by Canada, the cost to the 
       Contractor of such finished work plus the proportionate part of any 
       fee fixed by the said Contract and shall pay or reimburse the 
       Contractor the reasonable and proper cost to the Contractor of all 
       materials, parts or work in process delivered to Canada pursuant to 
       such direction.

<strong>1026B  25     (2004-12-10)  Termination</strong>

       by giving notice to the Contractor, terminate the Contract as 
       regards all or any part or parts of the Work not theretofore 
       completed.  Upon such notice being given, the Contractor shall cease 
       Work (including the manufacturing and procuring of materials for the 
       fulfilment of the Contract) in accordance with and to the extent 
       specified in such notice but shall proceed with all reasonable speed 
       to complete such part or parts (if any) of the Work as are by the 
       terms of such notice to be completed and shall also proceed with all 
       reasonable speed to complete up to such time or stage as may be 
       specified in the notice any part or parts of the Work as required by 
       such notice.  Furthermore, the Minister may, at any time or from 
       time to time, give one or more additional notices with respect to 
       any or all parts of the Work which remain to be completed after the 
       giving of any previous notice or notices.

2.     In the event of any notice given under the provisions of this 
       section, and subject as hereinafter provided:

       (a)    All Work completed by the Contractor hereunder before the 
              giving of such notice, and all Work completed thereafter 
              pursuant to such notice, shall be paid for (subject to 
              inspection and acceptance by Canada) in accordance with the 
              terms hereof;

       (b)    In respect of Work not completed hereunder before the giving 
              of such notice, and not completed thereafter pursuant to such 
              notice, Canada shall pay the Contractor's cost thereof as 
              determined under the provision hereof, and in addition an 
              amount representing a fair and reasonable profit in respect 
              of Work done thereon;

       (c)    Subject as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection 2, if 
              the Contract shall have specifically authorized or if the 
              Minister shall have specifically approved the making of 
              capital expenditures by the Contractor to enable it to carry 
              out the Contract, the Contractor shall be entitled to be 
              reimbursed the amount of such capital expenditures so 
              authorized or approved (and actually made or incurred) to the 
              extent that the same (less any depreciation in respect 
              thereof already taken into account in determining cost in 
              accordance with the provisions of the Contract) were 
              reasonably and properly incurred by the Contractor in respect 
              of and are properly apportionable to the performance of the 
              Contract;

       (d)    If the Contract is exclusively a Contract for the making of 
              capital expenditures in respect of additional equipment or 
              plant additions, the foregoing paragraphs (a) to (c) 
              inclusive of this subsection 2 shall not apply, but Canada 
              shall pay or reimburse the Contractor for the reasonable and 
              proper cost to the Contractor (not previously paid by Canada) 
              of:

              (i)    all additional equipment which, prior to the giving of 
                     the termination notice, shall have been purchased, 
                     acquired or manufactured by the Contractor, or 
                     contracted for and for which the Contractor is 
                     obligated to make payments, and

              (ii)   all additional equipment in process of manufacture by 
                     the Contractor as at the date of the giving of such 
                     notice and all Work in connection with the 
                     construction of the plant addition up to the said date, 
                     including the cost of materials and parts contracted 
                     for by the Contractor for the purpose of such 
                     manufacture of construction and for which the 
                     Contractor is obligated to make payment.

3.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1 and 2, the amounts 
       which the Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed in the event 
       of the giving of a termination notice under this section 25 shall 
       include, subject as hereinafter provided, the costs of the 
       Contractor of and incidental to the cancellation of obligations 
       incurred by the Contractor pursuant to the termination notice, the 
       cost of preparing the necessary accounts and statements with respect 
       to the Work performed to the effective date of such termination and 
       commitments made by the Contractor with respect to the terminated 
       portions of the Work, wages which the Contractor is obligated under 
       any laws or regulations for the time being in force, to pay to 
       employees whose services are no longer required by reason of such 
       termination, the costs of and incidental to the taking of an 
       inventory of materials, components, work in process and finished 
       work on hand at the effective date of the termination and other 
       costs and expenses of and incidental to the termination in whole or 
       in part, of operations under the Contract provided always that 
       payment and reimbursement under the provisions of this subsection 
       shall be made only to the extent that is established to the 
       satisfaction of the Minister that the costs and expenses aforesaid 
       were actually incurred by the Contractor and that the same are 
       reasonable and are properly attributable to the termination of the 
       Work or the part thereof so terminated.

4.     In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the Contract and in subletting of any Work hereunder, the 
       Contractor, unless otherwise authorized by the Minister, shall 
       procure or sublet on terms that will enable the Contractor to 
       terminate any contracts entered into by the Contractor upon the same 
       conditions and terms as those provided for in this section in 
       respect of the termination of the Contract by the Minister and the 
       giving of a notice or notices as aforesaid and upon the same 
       conditions and terms in respect of reimbursement and profit as those 
       contained in this section and in the event of the termination of the 
       Contract as herein provided as regards all or any part of the Work, 
       the Contractor shall co-operate with Canada and the Minister and do 
       everything reasonably within its power at all times to minimize and 
       reduce the amount of Canada's obligations under the provisions of 
       this section.

5.     In case of disagreement as to the amount which the Contractor is 
       entitled to be reimbursed, the matter shall be referred to the 
       Federal Court.

6.     Upon reimbursement being made the Contractor as herein provided, 
       title to the materials, parts, plant, equipment and work in process 
       in respect of which such reimbursement is made shall pass to and 
       vest in Canada (the Contractor hereby agreeing to execute and 
       deliver all requisite instruments by way of further assurance) and 
       such materials, parts, plant, equipment and work in process shall be 
       delivered to the order of the Minister, but the materials thus taken 
       over will in no case be in excess of what would have been required 
       for performing the Contract in full if no notice has been given 
       under the provisions hereof.

7.     If it is established to the satisfaction of the Minister by the 
       Contractor that by reason of any action taken by the Minister under 
       the provisions of this section exceptional hardship has resulted to 
       the Contractor, then the Minister may, notwithstanding any other 
       provisions of this section, in his absolute discretion grant such 
       allowance (not to include in any case, however, any allowance or 
       compensation for loss of profit) to the Contractor as, in the 
       opinion of the Minister, is warranted by the circumstances.

8.     The Contractor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of any action taken or notice given by the 
       Minister under or pursuant to the provisions of this section except 
       as and to the extent in this section expressly provided.

9.     The right of termination and of giving notice hereinbefore provided 
       for shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other 
       right possessed by Canada and the Minister.

<strong>1026B  34     (2007-05-25)  Taxes</strong>

1.     Municipal Taxes 
       Municipal Taxes are not applicable.

2.     Provincial Taxes<strong> </strong><strong></strong>

       (a)    Excluding legislated exceptions, federal government 
              departments and agencies are not required to pay any ad 
              valorem sales tax levied by the province in which the taxable 
              goods or services are delivered.  This exemption has been 
              provided to federal government departments and agencies under 
              the authority of one of the following:

              (i)    Provincial Sales Tax (PST) exemption license numbers 
                     for the provinces of:

                     Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250
                     Ontario                     11708174G
                     Manitoba             390-516-0
                     British Columbia     R005521

              (ii)   For Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, the 
                     Northwest Territories and Nunavut, an exemption 
                     certificate, which certifies that the goods or 
                     services purchased are not subject to the provincial/
                     territorial sales and consumption taxes because they 
                     are being purchased by the federal government with 
                     Canada funds for the use of the federal government. 

       (b)    Currently, in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest 
              Territories and Nunavut, there is no general PST.  However, 
              should a PST be introduced in the Northwest Territories, 
              Nunavut, or Yukon Territory, the sales tax exemption 
              certificate would be required on the purchasing document.

       (c)    Federal departments are required to pay the HST in the 
              participating provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova 
              Scotia and New Brunswick.

       (d)    The Contractor is not exempt from paying PST under the above 
              exemption license numbers or exemption certificate.  The 
              Contractor is required to pay the PST on taxable goods or 
              services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract 
              (as per appropriate provincial legislation), including 
              material incorporated into real property.

3.     Changes to Taxes and Duties

In the event of any change in any tax imposed under the <em>Excise Act</em>, R.S.C 
1985, c. E-14, and <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, or any duties 
imposed under the Customs Tariff or any other federal or provincial sales, 
excise or other like duties, taxes, charges or impositions after the bid 
submission date and which affects the costs of the Work to the Contractor, 
the Contract price will be adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in 
the cost to the Contractor.

4.     Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax

The estimated Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), 
if applicable, is included in the total estimated cost on page 1 of the 
Contract.  The GST or HST is not included in the Contract price but will be 
paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission clause below.  The 
Contractor agrees to remit to Canada Revenue Agency any amounts of GST and 
HST paid or due.

<strong>1026B  35     (2007-05-25)  Invoice Submission</strong>

Invoices must be submitted in the name of the Contractor.  They must show 
the name and address of the client department, item/reference number, 
deliverable and/or description of Work, contract serial number, Client 
Reference Number (CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN) and financial 
code(s).  If applicable, the method of shipment together with date, case 
numbers and part or reference numbers, item, quantity, unit of issue, unit 
price, and additional charges will be shown on the invoice.  If applicable, 
fixed-time labour rates and level of effort and, the amount invoiced 
(exclusive of the GST or HST as appropriate), will be shown separately.

GST or HST, if applicable, will be incorporated into all invoices and shown 
as a separate item on invoices.  All items that are zero-rated, exempt or 
to which the GST or HST does not apply, are to be identified as such on all 
invoices.  Invoices must be submitted for each delivery/shipment and must 
apply to one contract only.  Each invoice must indicate whether it covers 
partial or final delivery.

<strong>1026B  36     (2007-05-25)  Shipment Documentation</strong>

For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading must accompany 
the original invoice, except for "collect" shipments (if and when 
stipulated), in which event it must accompany the shipment.  In addition, a 
packing slip must accompany each shipment, showing item, quantity, part or 
reference numbers, description of suppliers and contract reference numbers, 
including the CRN and PBN.  If the goods have been inspected at the 
Contractor's plant, the signed inspection voucher must be attached to the 
packing slip normally enclosed in the packing note envelope.

<strong>1026B  37     (2007-11-30)  Condition of Material</strong>

Unless specified otherwise in the Contract, material supplied must be new 
and conform to the latest issue of the applicable drawing, specification 
and/or part number that is in effect on the solicitation closing date.

<strong>1026B  38     (2007-05-25)  Transportation Charges</strong>

If transportation charges are payable by Canada under the Contract and the 
Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments must be made by 
the most direct and economical means consistent with normal shipping 
practice.  The charges must be shown as a separate item on the invoice.  
The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks precludes 
payment of insurance or valuation charges for transportation beyond the 
point at which title of goods passes to the federal government (determined 
by the FOB point or Incoterms).  Where increased carrier liability is 
available without charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased 
liability for shipment.

<strong>1026B  39     (2007-05-25)  Shipment into Canada</strong>

Goods shipped into Canada from another country are to be consigned to 
destination, in bond, unless otherwise directed.

<strong>1026B  40     (2007-11-30)  International Sanctions</strong>

1.     Persons in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada, are bound by 
       economic sanctions imposed by Canada.  As a result, the Government 
       of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services that originate, 
       either directly or indirectly, from the countries or persons subject 
       to economic sanctions.

       Details on existing sanctions can be found at:

       or services which are subject to economic sanctions.

3.     The Contractor must comply with changes to the regulations imposed 
       during the period of the Contract. The Contractor must immediately 
       advise Canada if it is unable to perform the Work as a result of the 
       imposition of economic sanctions against a country or person or the 
       addition of a good or service to the list of sanctioned goods or 
       services. If the Parties cannot agree on a work around plan, the 
       Contract will be terminated in accordance with Section 25.

1996, c. 16, the clauses and conditions identified in the Contract by
