       with respect to the community of Sachs Harbour, shall prepare and 
       maintain a comprehensive list of Inuvialuit businesses which shall

       bids for Government Contracts in accordance with the bid invitation 
       process where bids are invited by public notice.

              more specialized Inuvialuit businesses to bid;

       (d)    permitting bids for goods and services for a specified 
              portion on a larger contract package to permit smaller and
