<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Evaluation using mandatory minimum requirements and point rating - 
Contractor selection on the basis of overall value.

BASIS OF SELECTION:

Further to DSS-MAS 9403-5 "Standard Instructions and Conditions", it is 
understood by the parties submitting proposals that, to be considered valid, 
a proposal must (a) meet all the mandatory requirements of this Request for 
Proposal (b) achieve a minimum of 70% of the points for the criteria which 
are subject to point rating. The rating is performed on a scale of 100 
points.

Proposals not meeting (a) or (b) above will be given no further 
   consideration. Neither the valid proposal that scores the highest number 
   of rating points nor the one that contains the lowest cost estimate will 
   necessarily be accepted. The selection of the Contractor will be made on 
   the basis of the best overall value to the Crown in terms of merit and 
   cost.
