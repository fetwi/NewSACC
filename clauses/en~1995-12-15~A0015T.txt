<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Canada will evaluate the bids received and such evaluation will be 
       based on the following factors:

       (a)    compliance with the terms and conditions of this bid 
              solicitation;

       (b)    the lowest evaluation price for a technically compliant 
              proposal to Canada for the Work, having regard to 
              qualifications, exceptions or alterations to the technical 
              requirements;

       (c)    assessment of all technical documentation and information for 
              technical compliance;

       (d)    delivery date;

       (e)    other criteria:

       <strong>[Procurement officer to list criteria. The number of criteria should 
       be adequate for comparative judgement. They should measure both the 
       competence of the bidder and the worth of the bidder's particular 
       technical approach.</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>       The former set of considerations would include such factors as those 
       relating to managerial structure, key personnel, prior industrial 
       experience, facilities and financial strength. The latter set would 
       include the proposed work breakdown structure, identification of key 
       technical problems and outlines of solutions, proposed schedule of 
       milestones, quality and time control systems to be employed.]</strong>

2.     Canada reserves the right to reject any bid which does not comply 
       with this solicitation.  Any deviation is to be clearly identified 
       and supported with full details.

       that it is capable of successfully completing the Work in accordance 
       with this solicitation. A Liquidated Damages clause may form part of 
       any resulting contract. 

4.     Should the Bidder provide the requested information to Canada in 
       confidence while indicating that the disclosed information is 
       confidential, then Canada will treat the information in a 
       confidential manner as provided in the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.
