       (b)    the lowest evaluation price for a technically compliant

              qualifications, exceptions or alterations to the technical 
              requirements;

       (c)    assessment of all technical documentation and information for

       <strong>[Procurement officer to list criteria. The number of criteria should 
       be adequate for comparative judgement. They should measure both the 
       competence of the bidder and the worth of the bidder's particular 
       technical approach.</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>       The former set of considerations would include such factors as those 
       relating to managerial structure, key personnel, prior industrial 
       experience, facilities and financial strength. The latter set would 
       include the proposed work breakdown structure, identification of key 
       technical problems and outlines of solutions, proposed schedule of 
       milestones, quality and time control systems to be employed.]</strong>
