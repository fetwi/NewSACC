<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause where Canada is to own the Foreground Information, if 
the Crown is prepared, at the time of the Contract, to consider granting the 
Contractor a license to exercise the Intellectual Property Rights in the 
Foreground Information owned by Canada, on terms and conditions that could 
include the payment of a royalty by the Contractor.

Article 9.1 of the Intellectual Property (IP) Policy states that the Crown 
should not unreasonably refuse to grant a license to the Contractor for the 
Contractor's use of the Foreground Information.  Where the client department is 
relying on any exception in the IP Policy for Canada's ownership of the 
Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground Information other than those 
exceptions set out in 6.4.2 or 6.4.3 of the IP Policy, or in the event that 
6.4.2 or 6.4.3 of the IP Policy was invoked by the Crown but a license is to be 
granted to the Contractor as part of the transfer of the final product or 
complete system to the private sector, then the following clause may be used.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Subject to subsection 2, if the Contractor wishes to make use of the 
       Foreground Information for purposes of its commercial exploitation 
       or further development, then the Contractor may make a written 
       request for a license to the minister for whose department or agency 
       the Work is being or was carried out.  Such a request should be made 
       within thirty (30) working days following completion of the Work.  
       The Contractor shall give that minister an explanation as to why 
       such a license is required.  That minister shall respond in writing 
       to any request for such a license within a reasonable period of time.  
       If the request is refused the response shall provide an explanation 
       for the refusal.  Should the minister for whose department the work 
       is being or was carried out agree to grant such a license, it shall 
       be on terms and conditions to be negotiated between the Contractor 
       and that minister.  It is understood that those terms may include 
       payment of compensation to Canada.

2.     Where the Work under the Contract involves the preparation of a 
       database or other compilation using information or data supplied by 
       Canada, or personal information (as this term is defined in the <em>
       Privacy Act</em> (R.S.C., c. P-21)) collected by the Contractor as part 
       of the Work, then the license referred to in subsection 1 shall be 
       restricted to the Intellectual Property Rights in Foreground 
       Information that are capable of being exploited without the use of 
       such information or data or such personal information.
