<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Automobile Liability Insurance, at varying limits, is statutory in all Canadian 
jurisdictions; nonetheless, use the following clause whenever the Contractor is 
called by the contract to make use of its own vehicle or where a government 
vehicle is being furnished for fulfilment of the contract requirements.

If either the contracting officer or the client believe that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $2,000,000 per loss is not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and the Risk 
Management and Insurance Advisor, Public Works and Government Services Canada 
(NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca).

Refer to G2025D for important additional endorsements that may apply to specific 
contracting areas.
