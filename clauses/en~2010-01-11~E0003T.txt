<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Canada will hold the security deposit as security to entry into a 
       contract.  If a successful bidder refuses to enter into contract, 
       the amount of the security deposit will be forfeited to Canada or a 
       demand for payment will be made against the letter of credit by 
       Canada.  The amount forfeited or payment demand will not exceed the 
       difference between the bid price and the amount of the Contract 
       awarded by Canada for the requirement.

2.     Canada will return all non-forfeited security deposits to 
       unsuccessful bidders after contract award, and to the successful 
       Bidder upon receipt of the required contract financial security.  If 
       no contract is awarded, Canada will return all security deposits at 
       the expiration of the bid validity period, including any extension.
