<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is set aside for Aboriginal business under the 
       federal government's Set-Aside Program for Aboriginal Business. 
       Bidders must complete and sign the certification "Certification 
       Requirements for the Set-Aside Program for Aboriginal Business" 
       contained in Appendix "____", <em>Requirements for the Set-Aside Program 
       for Aboriginal Business</em>, and this certification shall be submitted 
       with the proposal. <strong>It is a precondition to the submission of a valid 
       bid that this certification be accurately completed. Failure to 
       complete and submit the Certification with the proposal shall render 
       the proposal non-compliant.</strong>

2.     By executing the certification, the Bidder represents and warrants 
       that it is an Aboriginal business as defined in the Set-Aside 
       Program for Aboriginal Business.

3.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and shall rely upon 
       such representation and warranty to enter into any contract 
       resulting from this bid. Such representation and warranty of the 
       certification may be verified in such manner as the Minister may 
       reasonably require.

4.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       representation and warranty, the Minister shall have the right to 
       disqualify the bid or to treat any contract resulting from this bid 
       as being in default and render it subject to the remedies set out in 
       the certification and General Conditions.
