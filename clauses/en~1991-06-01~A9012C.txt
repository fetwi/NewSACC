<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>(1)  Unless otherwise provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall obtain 
the consent of the Minister, in writing, prior to the subcontracting of any 
portion of the Work.  Where consent is required and should the Contractor 
propose to solicit bids from other than Canadian sources, then consent 
shall be obtained in writing prior to the solicitation.  Any consent to a 
subcontract shall not relieve the Contractor from its obligations under the 
Contract or be construed as authorizing the establishment of any liability 
whatsoever on the part of Canada or the Minister to a subcontractor.

(2)  In any subcontract, other than a subcontract referred to in 
subparagraph (3) (b), the Contractor agrees to bind the subcontractor by 
the terms and conditions similar to and, in the opinion of the Minister, 
not less favourable to Canada than the Contract, to the extent they are 
applicable to the Work subcontracted unless the Minister otherwise consents.

(3)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Contractor may, without prior 
consent of the Minister:

       (a) purchase "off the shelf" items and such standard articles and 
       materials as are ordinarily manufactured or produced by mills and 
       manufacturers in the normal course of business;

       (b) subcontract any of the Work, to any one or more subcontractors, 
       up to a total value of:

              (i) for contracts valued up to $100,000 - 50 percent of the 
              contract value,

              (ii) for contracts valued over $100,000 - $50,000 plus 10 
              percent of the value of the Contract in excess of $100,000 up 
              to a total value of $100,000;

       (c) authorize its first and subsequent tier subcontractors to make 
       purchases or subcontract as permitted in subparagraphs (a) and (b).

(4)  Unless otherwise stated in the agreement, the Contractor is not 
obliged to seek consent to subcontracts referenced in the Contract.

(5)  When consent is required, the Contractor shall submit to the Science 
Contracting Officer a completed "Application for Permission to Sublet a 
Portion of Contract", form DSS-MAS 1137, a copy of the proposed subcontract, 
and any additional information required by the Science Contracting Officer.

DSS-MAS 1137 - APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO SUBLET A PORTION OF CONTRACT 
   attached as Annex "___" is modified as follows:  In the APPROVAL block, 
   after the wording General Conditions (Research and Development), add 
   DSS-MAS 9224.
