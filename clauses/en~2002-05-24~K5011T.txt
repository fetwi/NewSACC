<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in which the 
special procedures under the CKTEA are applicable (see Supply Manual), where 
competition is being solely limited to bids offering Canadian and/or Korean 
Goods and Services and where it is not mandatory that bidders submit a 
certification with their bid.  This clause is to be used for single item 
requirements and multi-item requirements that are being certified on an 
aggregate basis.

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K5000D, CKTEA Definitions.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is limited to Canadian and/or Korean Goods and 
       Services as defined in clause K5000D, CKTEA Definitions.

2.     The Bidder represents and warrants that, of the Goods and Services 
       being offered, no less than 60 percent of the bid price consists of 
       Canadian and/or Korean Goods and Services as defined in clause 
       K5000D, CKTEA Definitions. 

3.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this bid.  Such representation and warranty 
       of Canadian and/or Korean content may be verified in such manner as 
       the Minister may reasonably require.

4.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       covenant, the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract 
       resulting from this bid as being in default.

5.     If a Bidder is unable to verify the origin of Goods or Services 
       offered in the bid, then the bid will be considered non-responsive.

6.     The execution of this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph is a condition to render 
       the bid responsive.  Failure to provide the signed certification 
       upon request within _____ calendar days, if it is not submitted with 
       bid, will render the bid non-responsive.
