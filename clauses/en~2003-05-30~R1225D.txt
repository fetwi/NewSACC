3.     IP Rights Vest with Consultant

       Subject to subsections 10 and 11 and the provisions of GC 1.5 and

       documents and tools, Canada shall have unrestricted ownership rights 
       in those deliverables, including the right to make them available 
       for public use, whether for a fee or otherwise, and the right to 
       sell them.

5.     Licence to Foreground

       Without limiting any implied licences that may otherwise vest in 
       Canada, and in consideration of Canada's contribution to the cost of 
       development of the Foreground, the Consultant hereby grants to 
       Canada a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, 
       fully-paid and royalty-free licence to exercise all IP Rights in the 
       Foreground that vest in the Consultant pursuant to subsection 3, for 
       the purpose of:  

       (a)    the construction or implementation of any building, built 
              works, structures and facilities, contemplated by the Project;

       (b)    the further development or alteration or evolution of any 
              part of the constructed or implemented Project, including 
              procurement of materials and components for this purpose;

       (c)    the further development, modification (including additions or 
              deletions), completion, translation, or implementation of the 
              Foreground and any addition to it as Canada may require for 
              the purposes of the completion, utilization and subsequent 
              evolution of the Project;

              repair or restoration of the constructed or implemented or 
              subsequently modified Project, including the procurement of 
              replacement materials and components required for any such 
              purpose; and

       (e)    the publishing and transmission of reproductions of the 
              Project or any part thereof in the form of paintings, 
              drawings, engravings, photographs or cinematographic works, 
              to the public, in hard copy or by any electronic or other 
              means, except for copies in the nature of architectural 
              drawings or plans.

6.     Licence to Foreground for Other Projects

       The Consultant hereby grants to Canada a non-exclusive, perpetual, 
       world-wide, irrevocable licence to exercise all IP Rights that vest 
       in the Consultant pursuant to subsection 3 for the purpose of 
       planning, designing and constructing or otherwise implementing any 
       project other than the Project, and for any purpose set out in 
       subsection 5 as it relates to such other project.  In the event that 
       Canada exercises such IP Rights in an other project, and provided 
       that Canada does not already have equivalent rights under a previous 
       contract or otherwise, Canada agrees to pay to the Consultant 
       reasonable compensation determined in accordance with current 
       industry practice and having regard to Canada's contribution to the 
       cost of development of the Foreground.  The Consultant shall ensure 
       that in any sale, assignment, transfer or licence of any of the IP 
       Rights that vest in the Consultant under this Agreement, the 
       purchaser, assignee, transferee or licensee agrees to be bound by 
       the terms of this provision and to accept reasonable compensation as 
       is contemplated herein.  The Consultant shall also ensure that any 
       such purchaser, assignee, transferee or licensee of the IP Rights is 
       required to impose the same obligations on any subsequent purchaser, 
       transferee, assignee or licensee. 

7.     Licence to Background

       Without limiting any implied licences that may otherwise vest in 
       Canada, the Consultant hereby grants to Canada a non-exclusive, 
       perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully-paid and royalty-free 
       licence to exercise such of the IP Rights in any Background 
       incorporated into the Services or necessary for the performance of 
       the Services as may be required  

       (a)    for the purposes contemplated in subsections 5 and 6;

       (b)    for disclosure to any contractor engaged by Canada , or 
              bidder for such a contract, to be used solely for a purpose 
              set out in subsections 5 and 6;

       and the Consultant agrees to make any such Background available to 
       Canada upon request.

8.     Canada's Right to Disclose and Sub-license

       The Consultant acknowledges that Canada may wish to award contracts, 
       which may include a competitive process, for any of the purposes 
       contemplated in subsections 5, 6 and 7.  The Consultant agrees that 
       Canada's licence in relation to the IP Rights in the Foreground and 
       in the Background, includes the right to disclose that Foreground 
       and Background to bidders for such contracts, and to sub-license or 
       otherwise authorize the use of that Foreground and Background by any 
       contractor or consultant engaged by Canada for the purpose of 
       carrying out such a contract.  

9.     Consultant's Right to Grant Licence

       (a)    The Consultant represents and warrants that the Consultant 
              has, or the Consultant shall obtain without delay, the right 
              to grant to Canada the licence to exercise the IP Rights in 
              the Foreground and the Background as required by the 
              Agreement.

       (b)    Where the IP Rights in any Background or Foreground are or 
              will be owned by a Sub-Consultant, the Consultant shall 
              either obtain a licence from that Sub-Consultant that permits 
              compliance with subsections 5, 6 and 7 or shall arrange for 
              the Sub-Consultant to convey directly to Canada the same 
              rights by execution of the form provided for that purpose by 
              the Minister no later than the time of disclosure to Canada 
              of that Background and Foreground. 

10.    Trade Secrets and Confidential Information

       The Consultant shall not use or incorporate any trade secrets or 
       confidential information in any Foreground or Background used or 
       created in performance of this contract.

11.    Canada Supplied Information

       (a)    here performance of the Services involves the preparation of 
              a compilation using information supplied by Canada, then the 
              IP Rights that shall vest under subsection 3 shall be 
              restricted to the IP Rights in Foreground that are capable of 
              being exploited without the use of the information supplied 
              by Canada.  All IP Rights in any compilation, the Foreground 
              in which cannot be exploited without the use of such Canada 
              supplied information shall vest in Canada.  The Consultant 
              agrees that the Consultant shall not use or disclose any 
              Canada supplied information for any purpose other than 
              completing the performance of the Services.  The Consultant 
              shall maintain the confidentiality of such information.  
              Unless the Agreement otherwise expressly provides, the 
              Consultant shall deliver to Canada all such information 
              together with every copy, draft, working paper and note 
              thereof that contains such information upon the completion or 
              termination of the Agreement, or at such earlier time as the 
              Minister may require. 

       (b)    If the Consultant wishes to make use of any Canada supplied 
              information that was supplied for purposes of the Agreement, 
              for the commercial exploitation or further development of any 
              of the Foreground, then the Consultant may make a written 
              request for a licence to exercise the required IP Rights in 
              that Canada supplied information, to the Minister.  The 
              Consultant shall give the Minister an explanation as to why 
              such a licence is required.  Should the Minister agree to 
              grant such a licence, it shall be on terms and conditions to 
              be negotiated between the parties including payment of 
              compensation to Canada.

12.    Transfer of IP Rights

       (a)    If the Minister takes the Services out of the Consultant's 
              hands in accordance with GC 7 of the General Conditions, in 
              whole or in part, or if the Consultant fails to disclose any 
              Foreground in accordance with subsection 2, the Minister may 
              upon reasonable notice, require the Consultant to convey to 
              Canada all of the IP Rights in the Foreground or in the case 
              of a failure to disclose, all the IP Rights in the Foreground 
              not provided. The IP Rights to be conveyed shall include the 
              IP Rights in any Foreground that have vested or are to vest 
              in a Sub-Consultant. In the case of IP Rights in Foreground 
              which have been sold or assigned to a party other than a 
              Sub-Consultant, the Consultant shall not be obligated to 
              convey those IP Rights to Canada, but shall pay to Canada on 
              demand an amount equal to the consideration which the 
              Consultant received from the sale or assignment of the IP 
              Rights in that Foreground or, in the case of a sale or 
              assignment was not at arm's length, the fair market value of 
              the IP Rights in that Foreground, in each case including the 
              value of future royalties or licence fees.

       (b)    In the event of the issuance by the Minister of a notice 
              referred to in (a), the Consultant shall, at the Consultant's 
              own expense and without delay, execute such conveyances or 
              other documents relating to title to the IP Rights as Canada 
              may require, and the Consultant shall, at Canada's expense, 
              afford the Minister all reasonable assistance in the 
              preparation of applications and in the prosecution of any 
              applications for, or any registration of, any IP Right in any 
              jurisdiction, including without limitation the assistance of 
              the inventor in the case of Inventions.

       (c)    Until the Consultant completes the performance of the 
              Services and discloses all of the Foreground in accordance 
              with subsection 2, and subject to the provisions of GC 1.5, 
              the Consultant shall not, without the prior written 
              permission of the Minister, sell, assign or otherwise 
              transfer title to the IP Rights in any of the Foreground, or 
              license or otherwise authorize the use of the IP Rights in 
              any of the Foreground by any person.

       (d)    In any sale, assignment, transfer or licence of IP Rights in 
              Foreground by the Consultant except a sale or licence for end 
              use of a product based on Foreground, the Consultant shall 
              impose on the other party all of its obligations to Canada in 
              relation to the IP Rights in the Foreground and any 
              restrictions set out in the Agreement on the use or 
              disposition of the IP Rights in the Foreground (and, if 
              applicable, the Foreground itself), including the obligation 
              to impose the same obligations and restrictions on any 
              subsequent transferee, assignee or licensee.  The Consultant 
              shall promptly notify Canada of the name, address and other 
              pertinent information in regard to any transferee, assignee 
              or licensee.
