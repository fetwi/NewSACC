<pre>1.     Persons and companies in Canada are bound by economic sanctions 
       imposed by Canada.  As a result, the Government of Canada cannot 
       accept delivery of goods or services that originate, either directly 
       or indirectly, from the countries subject to economic sanctions.  
       Details on existing sanctions can be found at:

2.     It is a condition of this Contract that the Contractor not supply to 
       the Government of Canada any goods or services which are subject to 
       economic sanctions.

3.     By law, the Contractor must comply with changes to the regulations 
       imposed during the life of the Contract.  During the performance of 
       the Contract should the addition of a country to the list of 
       sanctioned countries or the additions of a good or service to the 
       list of sanctioned goods or services cause an impossibility of 
       performance for the Contractor, the situation will be treated by the 
       Parties as a force majeure.  The Contractor shall forthwith inform 
       Canada of the situation; the procedures applicable to force majeure 
       shall then apply.
