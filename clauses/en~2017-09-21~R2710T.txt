If Canada establishes after award of the Contract that the Bidder provided a false or misleading certification or declaration, Canada may terminate the Contract for default. Pursuant to the Policy, Canada may also determine the Bidder to be ineligible for award of a contract for providing a false or misleading certification or declaration. </li>

      <ol type="a">
<li>the Bidder's bidding privileges are suspended or are in the process of being suspended;</li>
<li>the bidding privileges of any employee or subcontractor included as part of the bid are suspended or are in the process of being suspended, which suspension or pending suspension would render that employee or subcontractor ineligible to bid on the Work, or the portion of the Work the employee or subcontractor is to perform;</li>
<li>the Bidder is bankrupt, or where for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li>evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has been received with respect to the Bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of its bid;</li>
<li>evidence satisfactory to Canada that based on past conduct or behavior, the Bidder, a sub-contractor or a person who is to perform the Work is unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly;</li>

<li>the overall management of the Work and its effect on the level of effort demanded of the department and its representative; and</li>
<li>the completeness and effectiveness of the Contractor's safety program during the performance of the Work.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Without limiting the generality of paragraphs 1), 2)
      and 3) of GI11, Canada may reject any bid based on an unfavourable assessment of the
      <ol type="a">
<li>adequacy of the bid price to permit the work to be carried out and, in the case of a bid providing prices per unit, whether each such price reasonably reflects the cost of performing the part of the work to which that price applies;</li>
<li>Bidder's ability to provide the necessary management structure, skilled personnel, experience and equipment to perform competently the work under the Contract; and</li>
<li>Bidder's performance on other contracts.</li>

      <ol type="a">
<li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees was involved in any manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees had access to information related to the bid solicitation that was not available to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing or has provided the goods and services described in the bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li>Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
