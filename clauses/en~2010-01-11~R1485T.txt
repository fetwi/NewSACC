<strong>FEDERAL CONTRACTORS PROGRAM</strong>

1.     The Federal Contractors Program (FCP) requires that some firms, 
       including a Proponent who is a member of a joint venture, bidding 
       for federal government contracts, valued at $200,000 or more 
       (including all applicable taxes), make a formal commitment to 
       implement employment equity.  This is a condition precedent to 
       contract award.  If the Proponent, or, if the Proponent is a joint 
       venture and if any member of the joint venture, is subject to the 
       FCP, evidence of its commitment must be provided before the award of 
       the Contract.

       Firms who have been declared ineligible contractors by Human 
       Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer 
       eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold for 
       solicitation of bids as set out in the Government Contracts 
       Regulations.  Firms may be declared ineligible contractors either as 
       a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRSDC, or following their 
       voluntary withdrawal from the FCP for a reason other than the 
       reduction of their workforce to less than 100 employees.  Any bids 
       from ineligible contractors, including a bid from a joint venture 
       that has a member who is an ineligible contracotr, will be declared 
       non-responsive.
 
2.     If the Proponent does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 3.(
       a) or (b) below, or does not have a valid certificate number 
       confirming its adherence to the FCP, the Proponent must fax 
       (819-953-8768) a copy of the signed form LAB 1168, Certificate of 
       Commitment to Implement Employment Equity, to the Labour Branch of 
       HRSDC.

3.     The Proponent, or, if the Proponent is a joint venture the member of 
       the joint venture, certifies its status with the FCP, as follows:

       The Proponent or the member of the joint venture 

       (a)    (    ) is not subject to the FCP, having a workforce of less 
                     than 100 full-time or part-time permanent employees,  
                     or temporary employees having worked 12 weeks or more 
                     in Canada,

       (b)    (    ) is not subject to the FCP, being a regulated employer

                     workforce of 100 or more  full time or part-time 
                     permanent employees, or temporary employees having 
                     worked 12 weeks or more in Canada, but has not 
                     previously obtained a certificate number from HRSDC, 
                     having not bid on requirements of $200,000 or more, in 
                     which case a duly signed certificate of commitment is 
                     attached;

       (d)    (    ) is subject to the FCP, and has a valid certificate 
                     number as follows: _______ (e.g. has not been declared
