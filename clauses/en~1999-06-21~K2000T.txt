<pre>1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP) requires 
       that some organizations bidding for federal government contracts 
       make a formal commitment to implement employment equity, as a 
       pre-condition to the validation of their bids. All bidders must 
       check the applicable box(es) below. Failure to do so will render the 
       bid non-responsive.

2.     Please indicate below why the Program requirements <strong>do not apply</strong>:

       (  )   bid is less than $200,000;

       (  )   this organization has fewer than 100 permanent part-time and/
              or full time employees across Canada;

       (  )   this organization is a federally regulated employer;

<strong>       OR,</strong> in cases when the FCP requirements <strong>do apply</strong>, please indicate 
       whether you are transmitting with your bid:

       (  )   a new, duly signed, Certificate of Commitment; or

       (  )   the number of your existing Certificate of Commitment as 
              follows: _____.

       <strong>NOTE:</strong>

       1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity applies 
              to Canadian-based bidders only.

       2.     The Certificate of Commitment, criteria and other information
