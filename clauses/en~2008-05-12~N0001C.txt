<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use the following clause in contracts when limiting a contractor's liability to 
Canada, but not limiting each party's liability for damages to third parties. 
Typically, this clause would be used when a commodity grouping exists (other 
than Information Management or Information Technology or Satellite Services, 
which have their own clauses) or after a risk assessment has been performed to 
determine the risk exposure and amount of protection required by Canada.
 </p>
<p>
  Limiting a contractor's liability should be an exception to the normal practice 
of using the standard conditions. When the decision is made to limit a 
contractor's liability to Canada, contracting officers, in conjunction with 
client departments, must be able to demonstrate that the risks associated with 
the procurement have been analyzed and that the limitation of liability provides 
adequate protection to Canada.  Decisions with respect to limiting a 
contractor's liability should be made before the bid solicitation release or, in 
instances of non-competitive contracts, before the start of negotiations.

  The dollar amount below must be completed using the amount from the appropriate 
commodity grouping, or in consultation with Risk Management Advisory Services.

  Clauses
  
   N0001C
  
  and
  
   N0002C
  
  are similar, in that both create a limit on the 
contractor's liability for damages to Canada. However, the two clauses deal with 
the contractor's liability for claims made by third parties in different ways. 
N0001C essentially provides that the parties agree to allow the laws in the 
jurisdiction of the contract to determine who is responsible for any damages to 
third parties.  It then goes on to provide that, if Canada must pay the third 
party for damages caused by the contractor because of joint and several 
liability, the contractor must reimburse Canada for that amount.  In short, 
under clause
  
   N0001C
  
  , each party is responsible for any damages that it causes to 
third parties.  On the other hand, clause
  
   N0002C
  
  states that the contractor must 
indemnify Canada against any third party claims that relate to the contract.
