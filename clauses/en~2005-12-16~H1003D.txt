              payments exceed _____ percent of the total to be paid by 
              Canada under the Contract.

2.     Each claim must show the following:

       (a)    expenditures plus pro-rated profit or fee if applicable or, 
              alternatively, the value of milestones during the claim 
              period by line item as detailed in the payment terms of the 
              Contract;

       (b)    less holdback at _____ percent, calculated on the amount in 2. 
              (a);

       (c)    total of all previous claims against the Contract;

       (d)    Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax, as applicable, 
              calculated on the amount in 2. (a) above.

3.     The balance of the amount payable will be paid upon satisfactory 
       completion of the Contract or in the case of unit price contracts 
       upon the delivery and acceptance of each unit, provided that a final 
       claim for such payment is submitted.  (Refer to the invoicing 
       instructions in the Contract.)

4.     If specified herein, the form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111 shall be accompanied 
       by the required copies of monthly progress reports.

5.     The Contractor shall prepare the original and two (2) copies of its 
       claim on form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111, and they shall be routed as follows:

       (a)    _____ Authority;
       (b)    _____ Authority;
       (c)    Payment Office.

6.     Progress payments shall be regarded as interim payments only and 
       Canada shall have the right to conduct interim cost/time 
       verifications or audits and to make adjustments from time to time 
       during the performance of the Work.  Any overpayment resulting from 
       such progress payments or otherwise shall be refunded promptly to 
       Canada.
 
7.     Payment by Canada to the Contractor for the Work shall be made:

       (a)    in the case of a progress payment other than the final 
              payment, within thirty (30) days following the date of 
              receipt of a duly completed form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111;

       (b)    in the case of a final payment, within thirty (30) days 
              following the date of receipt of the duly completed final 
              form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111, or within thirty (30) days following 
              the date on which the Work is completed, whichever date is 
              the later.

8.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the progress claim, 
       within fifteen (15) days of its receipt, Canada shall notify the 
       Contractor of the nature of the objection.  "Form of the claim" 
       means a claim that contains or is accompanied by such substantiating 
       documentation as Canada requires.  Failure by Canada to act within 
       fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified in 
       subsection 7 of the clause to apply for the sole purpose of 
       calculating interest on overdue accounts.
