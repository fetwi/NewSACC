<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Canada's total liability under this contract shall not exceed $ _____, 
       Goods and Services Tax (GST) extra.

2.     No increase in the total liability of Canada or in the price of Work 
       resulting from any design changes, modifications or interpretations 
       of specifications, made by the Contractor, will be authorized or 
       paid to the Contractor unless such changes, modifications or 
       interpretations, have been approved, in writing, by the Contracting 
       Authority, prior to their incorporation into the Work. The 
       Contractor shall not be obliged to perform any work or provide any 
       service that would cause the total liability of Canada to be 
       exceeded without the prior written approval of the Contracting 
       Authority. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Authority in 
       writing as to the adequacy of this sum when: 

       (a)    it is 75 percent committed, or
       (b)    four (4) months prior to the Contract expiry date, or
       (c)    if the Contractor considers the funds provided are inadequate 
              for the completion of the work,
       whichever comes first.

3.     In the event that the notification refers to inadequate funds, the 
       Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Authority, in writing, 
       an estimate for the additional funds required. Provision of such 
       notification and estimate for the additional funds does not increase 
       Canada's liability.
