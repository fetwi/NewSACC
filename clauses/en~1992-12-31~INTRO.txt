<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><strong>AUTHORITY </strong>

1.     On June 8, 1991, the Department of Supply and Services (DSS) 
       published Ministerial Order No. 1 respecting general terms and 
       conditions of contracts in the Canada Gazette, Part 1. 

2.     This Order, under the authority of the Department of Supply and 
       Services Act, enables DSS to incorporate those terms and conditions 
       contained in the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) 
       Manual, by reference, into procurement documents issued by the 
       Department. 

<strong>DISTRIBUTION </strong>

3.     The SACC Manual has been produced in both conventional (print) and 
       electronic format. The print format has been provided to client 
       departments and DSS procurement officers and may be purchased by 
       suppliers in English or French or both languages, from the Canada 
       Communication Group - Publishing. An electronic version of the 
       Manual is accessible as an information module on the Open Bidding 
       Service (OBS) bulletin board. Copies of the Manual have also been 
       distributed to DSS procurement offices in Canada, the United States 
       and Europe, and to Canadian public libraries through the Depository 
       Services Program.

<strong>Amendments</strong>

4.     Federal government departments and agencies and DSS procurement 
       personnel will automatically be provided with amendments to the SACC 
       Manual. 

5.     Subscribers (suppliers) to the print version of the Manual will be 
       provided with amendments on a Standing Order basis - the cost of 
       each update will depend on the number of pages it contains. 
       Amendments to the SACC Manual module of the OBS will be highlighted 
       in the "SACC Library" section of the OBS.

<strong>STRUCTURE </strong>

9.     The Manual has been organized to follow the progression of 
       information presented in procurement documents: 

<strong>Section 1 - Standard Instructions and Conditions </strong>

10.    Previously printed on the reverse of page 1 of solicitations and 
       contracts, or included as attachments, these instructions and 
       conditions are now identified in standard clause A0000D at the 
       beginning of the clause section in procurement documents. 

<strong>Section 2 - Programs and Policies Relevant to Acquisitions </strong>

11.    This section provides basic information on national programs and 
       policies which affect procurement and which are mandatory for 
       various classes of contracts (e.g. Employment Equity - the Federal 
       Contractors Program applies to requirements with an anticipated 
       expenditure of $200,000 or more). The reader is directed to the 
       specific clauses and/or conditions which may be referred to in a 
       procurement document. In certain cases, the applicable certificates 
       or forms have been reproduced for the perusal and/or use of the 
       reader. 

<strong>Sections 3 and 4 - General Conditions and Supplemental General Conditions </strong>

12.    These sections present those sets of standard conditions which form 
       the foundation upon which all procurement documents issued by DSS 
       are built. Section 3 defines the basic sets of conditions which 
       apply to specific classes of contracts (e.g. DSS-MAS 9329 - General 
       Conditions - Purchase of Commercially Available Off-the-shelf Goods 
       and Services). Section 4, Supplemental General Conditions, addresses 
       areas unique to specific sub-classes of contracts (e.g. DSS-MAS 1028 
       - Supplemental General Conditions - Ship Construction - Firm Price). 

13.    Each section/article within a condition set has been given its own 
       effective date. The condition set as a whole has also been given an 
       effective date which is reflected in section 00 and is determined by 
       the latest revision date of one or more of its sections.

<strong>Section 5 - Standard Procurement Clauses </strong>

14.    This section contains a collection of national procurement clauses, 
       common to various classes of contracts. The full text of individual 
       clauses, incorporated by reference into a bid solicitation or 
       contract by their Number, Title and Effective Date, can be found in 
       this section of the Manual. Each subsection (A-Z) is devoted to a 
       particular subject area. Please note that some subsections have not 
       been assigned at this time. 

15.    Clauses may be identified by their numbers which break down as 
       follows: 

       (a)    the first alphabetic character (A-Z) indicates the subsection 
              in Section 5; 

       (b)    the four numeric characters (0000-9999) indicate the clause's 
              position within the numeric sequence of the subsection;  
       (c)    the final alphabetic character (T, C or D) indicates the type 
              of document in which a given clause would be used (i.e. T = 
              Tender; C = Contract; D = Dual purpose, used in both tenders 
              and contracts). 

       Example:      Clause C0004T - Price Certification. This is the 
                     fourth sequential clause found in subsection C - Price, 
                     of Section 5 and is used in Tender (solicitation) 
                     documents. 

<strong>Section 6 - Indexes </strong>

16.    This section provides an alphabetic and a numeric index of national 
       clauses. To further assist users during the introductory period for 
       the Manual, a second numeric index by "old" clause numbers 
       cross-referencing to "new" clause numbers has been provided. 

<strong>USE OF THE MANUAL </strong>

<strong>Reference clauses</strong>

17.    Bid solicitations and contracts will contain references to specific 
       clauses and general conditions which will apply to that particular 
       requirement. Clause references will include the clause number, its 
       effective date and its title (e.g. A0001T (06/91) Survey of 
       Facilities). All clauses referred to in this manner can be found in 
       Section 5 of this Manual. 

<strong>Fill-in clauses</strong>

18.    Clauses which require the insertion of specific information by the 
       procurement officer or the supplier (fill-in clauses) will be 
       produced in full on procurement documents. 

       <strong>NOTE</strong>:  In the case of discrepancies in clause versions between 
              solicitation documents and the Manual, any clause appearing 
              in full text in a procurement document will override any 
              version set out in the SACC Manual. 

<strong>Amendments </strong>

19.    The Manual will be amended from time to time, as required. In most 
       instances, this will mean replacing individual pages while in others, 
       whole sections or subsections may require replacement. DSS will 
       provide a synopsis for each amendment, identifying what has been 
       changed. Users are urged to read these amendments immediately and 
       register these updates on the Record of Amendments page at the 
       beginning of the Manual. 

20.    As with any new product, the Manual is evolving and amendments will 
       be necessary from time to time. It is our intent to keep these 
       updates to a minimum and to maintain a regular schedule. Revisions 
       to the print copy and the OBS will become effective simultaneously; 
       however, advance warning of changes may be available on the OBS. 
       Information on subscribing to the OBS may be obtained by calling 
       (XXX) XXX-XXXX (National Capital Region [NCR]) or 1-800-XXX-XXXX 
       (outside the NCR).

21.    Your comments and suggestions on how to make the SACC Manual more 
       useful and effective as SSC moves into a new era in procurement are 
       welcomed and may be directed to the Operational Analysis Group, 
       Supply Program Management Directorate, 14A1, Place du Portage, Phase 
       III, Hull, P.Q. K1A 0S5, (819) 956-6499.
