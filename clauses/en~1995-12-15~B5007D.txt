<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>In the event of Design Changes, whether introduced by the Owner or the 
Contractor, the detailed procedure given below must be followed:   

<strong>Design Changes originating from the Technical Authority:</strong>

1.     The Technical Authority will inform the Contracting Authority of the 
       Design Change requirement giving sufficient details.

2.     The Contracting Authority will forward this information to the 
       Contractor requesting estimates for the Work on a firm price basis 
       wherever possible (increased or decreased).

3.     The Contractor shall submit an estimate, supported by full details 
       to the Contracting Authority on:

       a)     form DSS-MAS 1686, "Quotation for Design Change or Additional 
              Work," in the case of new design or new ship construction; or

       b)     form DSS-MAS 1379, "Work Arising or New Work", in the case of 
              ship refit or ship repair.

4.     The Contracting Authority will evaluate and negotiate with the 
       Contractor as necessary and, upon agreement being reached, authorize 
       the Work and amend the Contract accordingly.

<strong>Design Changes originating from the Contractor:</strong>

1.     The Contractor will submit the proposal to the Contracting Authority, 
       supported by full details including specifications and drawings if 
       necessary, and reasons for the submission, together with the 
       estimated cost (increased or decreased) for the Work, and request 
       approval for same.

2.     If approved, the Contracting Authority will negotiate with the 
       Contractor, finalize prices, authorize the Work and amend the 
       Contract. If not approved, the Contracting Authority will advise the 
       Contractor. If approved with the modifications, the procedures 
       outlined under "Design Changes Originating from the Technical 
       Authority" will be followed.
 
<strong>Local approvals:</strong>

1.     For Design Changes of a minor nature and low-dollar value, and 
       particularly those requiring urgent decisions, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, 
       these will be dealt with by the Contracting Authority on site.

2.     The Contracting Authority will negotiate "firm price" with the 
       Contractor for the Work and will then discuss same with the 
       Technical Authority and, upon agreement, will approve and advise the 
       Contractor to proceed.

3.     The Contract will be amended.

4.     Forms will be provided for the proper reporting of the above and 
       individual and cumulative maximum dollar values.  Work valued higher 
       than the approval level of the on-site Contracting Authority, cannot 
       be authorized without prior approval by Canada.
