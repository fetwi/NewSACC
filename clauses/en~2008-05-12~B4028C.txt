<ul class="hierarchy">
<li><span class="number">7.1</span> Except as provided in subsection 7.2, the hours and minutes for which a charge is made must be computed from the time the aircraft leaves the surface of the earth and terminating when the aircraft touches the surface of the earth at the next point of landing. The term "Firm Rate Per Hour" is an hourly charge or portion of an hourly charge of "Air Time" as defined in the <cite><a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/menu.htm " rel="external">Canadian Aviation Regulations</a></cite>, Part VIII, Air Navigation Services, and will be the basis of
calculating charges for air services.</li>
<li><span class="number">7.2</span> When operations involve a continuous succession of flights, each of less than ten (10)
minutes duration, and the engine is not shut down between such flights, air time must be computed from the time the aircraft leaves the surface of the earth for the first flight and ceases when the aircraft touches the surface of the earth at the final point of landing.</li>
<li><span class="number">7.3</span> In determining the duration of a flight:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">each fraction of an hour must be stated as a decimal, established on the basis of a six-minute period,</li>
<li value="2">each period of less than three minutes must be rounded to zero, and</li>

<li value="9"><strong>Methods of Measuring Distance Fixed Wing Only</strong>
<ul class="hierarchy">

<li><span class="number">9.2</span> The distances of flights, other than a flight referred to in subsection 9.1, must be measured in a straight line between the places of commencement and completion of the Work provided for in the charter, using standard 8 miles to 1 inch aeronautical charts of the National Topographic Series, as issued by the Department of Natural Resources, Ottawa.</li>
