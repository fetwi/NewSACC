<pre>1.     This is an urgent United States (U.S.) government defence 
       requirement and use of a U.S. priority rating is authorized and 
       assigned.  This priority rating is valid only for the purchase of 
       materials, sub-assemblies and components (excluding controlled goods) 
       by the Contractor directly from U.S. contractors up to a total of US$ _____.  
       If the Contractor exceeds the dollar limitation, the Contractor is 
       authorized to proceed with the purchase order while providing the 
       Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, Public Works and 
       Government Services Canada (PWGSC), with details of the additional 
       amount required, either by e-mail to: <a href="mailto:ACQBDefencePriorities.DGAPrioritesdedefense@tpsgsc-pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">ACQBDefencePriorities.DGAPrioritesdedefense
       @tpsgsc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a>, or by facsimile at 819-956-1459.

2.     The assigned U.S. priority rating, required delivery date, signature 
       of an individual authorized to sign rated orders, and the following 
       certification must be placed on or attached to the Contractor's 
       purchase order to U.S. contractors:

              "This is a rated order certified for national defense use, 
              and the Contractor is required to follow all the provisions 
              of the United States Defense Priorities and Allocations 
              Systems regulation (15 CFR Part 700)."

3.     Assigned U.S. priority ratings may not be extended within Canada. In 
       consequence, when further materials are imported through the 
       Contractor's Canadian subcontractors or distributors, the following 
       paragraph must be added in the purchase order with the Canadian 
       subcontractor:

              "<strong>PRIORITY ASSISTANCE</strong>: This is an urgent defence requirement.  
              If the Contractor is importing any material/service from 
              United States (U.S.) for the fulfilment of the Contract, 
              contact the Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, 
              Public Works and Government Services Canada , to request a U.S. 
              priority rating."

4.     The Contractor must keep for a period of three (3) years, and 
       provide to Canada, on request, a record of its authority to use the 
       rating authorization and of all the uses made of it by the 
       Contractor.

5.     Special Priority Assistance:

If the Contractor needs assistance in obtaining delivery under a delinquent 
rated order with a U.S. contractor, the Contractor should contact the 
Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, PWGSC.
