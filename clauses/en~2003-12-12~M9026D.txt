<pre>1.     Payment by Canada for the Work shall be made in accordance with the 
       Basis of Payment specified herein:

       (a)    within thirty (30) days following the date on which the Work 
              has been performed; or

       (b)    within thirty (30) days following the date on which an 
              invoice and substantiating documentation are received 
              according to the terms of the Standing Offer;

       whichever date is the later.

2.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the invoice or the 
       substantiating documentation, within fifteen (15) days of its 
       receipt Canada shall notify the Offeror of the nature of the 
       objection.  "Form of the invoice" means an invoice which contains or 
       is accompanied by such substantiating documentation as Canada 
       requires.  Failure by Canada to act within fifteen (15) days will 
       only result in the date specified in paragraph 1 of the clause to 
       apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest on overdue 
       accounts.
