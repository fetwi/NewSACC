under the resulting contract clauses.

See clause E0003T when E0004T is used and a contract financial security is also 
required.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Canada will hold the security deposit as security to enter into 
       contract.  If a successful bidder refuses to enter into contract, 
       the amount of the security deposit will be forfeited to Canada or a 
       demand for payment will be made against the letter of credit by 
       Canada.  The amount forfeited or payment demand will not exceed the 
       difference between the bid price and the amount of the Contract 
       awarded by Canada for the requirement.

2.     Canada will return all non-forfeited security deposits to bidders 
       after contract award or, if no contract is awarded, at the 
       expiration of the bid validity period, including any extension.
