</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2014-09-252010Csubcontracts">2010C 06 (2013-06-27) Subcontracts</h2>
<p>The Contractor may subcontract the supply of goods or services
that are customarily subcontracted by the Contractor.
Subcontracting does not relieve the Contractor from any of its
obligations under the Contract or impose any liability upon Canada
to a subcontractor. In any subcontract, the Contractor agrees to
bind the subcontractor by the same conditions by which the
Contractor is bound under the Contract, unless the Contracting
Authority agrees otherwise, with the exception of requirements under the Federal Contractors Program for employment equity which only apply to the Contractor.</p>
<h2 id="2014-09-252010Ctime-of-the-essence">2010C 07 (2008-05-12) Time of the Essence</h2>
<p>It is essential that the Work be performed within or at the time

<ol type="1">

obligation under the Contract that is caused by an event that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">is beyond the reasonable control of the
Contractor;</li>
<li value="2">could not reasonably have been foreseen;</li>
<li value="3">could not reasonably have been prevented by means
reasonably available to the Contractor; and</li>
<li value="4">occurred without the fault or neglect of the
Contractor,</li>
</ol>
will be considered an "Excusable Delay" if the Contractor
advises the Contracting Authority of the occurrence of the delay or
of the likelihood of the delay as soon as the Contractor becomes
aware of it. The Contractor must also advise the Contracting
Authority, within 15 working days, of all the
circumstances relating to the delay and provide to the Contracting
Authority for approval a clear work around plan explaining in
detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to
minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.
</li>
<li value="2">Any delivery date or other date that is directly
affected by an Excusable Delay will be postponed for a reasonable
time that will not exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="3">However, if an Excusable Delay has continued for
30 days or more, the Contracting Authority may, by giving
notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the Contract. In
such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim
against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other
loss arising out of the termination or the event that contributed
to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately
to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated
at the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Unless Canada has caused the delay by failing to meet
an obligation under the Contract, Canada will not be responsible
for any costs incurred by the Contractor or any of its
subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</li>

Work</h2>
<p>All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada.
Inspection and acceptance of the Work by Canada do not relieve the
Contractor of its responsibility for defects or other failures to
meet the requirements of the Contract. Canada will have the right
to reject any work that is not in accordance with the requirements
of the Contract and require its correction or replacement at the
Contractor's expense.</p>

<h2 id="2014-09-252010Ctaxes">2010C 11 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">
Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes.
</li>
<li value="2">
Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section.

<li value="4">
In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award.  However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change.

<ol type="1">

The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31<sup>st</sup> day following that date and interest

<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
15 days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>

<p>The Contractor is liable for any damage caused by the
Contractor, its employees, subcontractors, or agents to Canada or
any third party. Canada is liable for any damage caused by Canada,
its employees or agents to the Contractor or any third party. The
Parties agree that no limitation of liability or indemnity
provision applies to the Contract unless it is specifically
incorporated in full text in the Articles of Agreement. Damage
includes any injury to persons (including injury resulting in

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">At any time before the completion of the Work, the
Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the
Contractor, terminate for convenience the Contract or part of the

<li value="2">	The Contractor confirms that it understands that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences may result in a termination for default under the Contract. If the Contractor made a false declaration in its bid, makes a false declaration under the Contract, fails to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested, or if the Contractor or any of the Contractor's Affiliates fail to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions during the contract period, such false declaration or failure to comply may result, following a notice period, in a termination for default under the Contract. The Contractor understands that a termination for default will not restrict Canada’s right to exercise any other remedies that may be available against the Contractor and agrees to immediately return any advance payments.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Contractor's Affiliates if:

<li value="6">	The Contractor certifies that neither the Contractor nor any of the Contractor's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Contract if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
