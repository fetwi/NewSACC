<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Evaluation using point rating - Contractor selection on the basis of best 
overall value.

BASIS OF SELECTION:

Further to DSS-MAS 9403-5 "Standard Instructions and Conditions", it is 
understood by the parties submitting proposals that, to be considered valid, 
a proposal must achieve a minimum of 70% of the  points for the criteria 
used in the point rating. The rating is performed on a scale of 100 points.

Proposals not meeting this minimum requirement will be given no further 
   consideration. Neither the qualifying proposal that scores the highest 
   number of rating points nor the one that contains the lowest cost 
   estimate will necessarily be accepted. The selection of the Contractor 
   will be made on the basis of the best overall value to the Crown in 
   terms of merit and cost.
