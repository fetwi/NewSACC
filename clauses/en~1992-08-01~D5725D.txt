<pre>Use the following clause to outline Bidder/Contractor responsibility to inspect 
and provide an inspection/test report of actual measurements taken when

5306, 5307, 5310 and 5315.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Items identified as Safety Critical Class 3 fasteners on this Contract, 
require the Contractor to provide to the Quality Assurance Representative 
(QAR) a valid inspection/test report of the results obtained for the 
following parameters:

       a.     "go" functional diameter size;

       b.     pitch diameter size;

       c.     major diameter size (external threads only);

       d.     minor diameter size (does not apply to MIL-S-7742 external 
              threads);

       e.     root radius (applies to MIL-S-8879 external threads only);

       f.     flank angle;  

       g.     lead (including helix variations);

       h.     circularity;

       j.     taper;

       k.     runout; and

       m.     surface roughness 

If the differential between "GO" Functional and Pitch diameter does not 
exceed 0.5 for MIL-S-7742 or 0.4 for MIL-S-8879 of the Pitch diameter 
tolerance, inspection of the Flank Angle and Lead (including helix 
variations) is not necessary.

Definitions of these terms can be found in the latest revision of 
MIL-S-7742 or MIL-S-8879.
              
The Contractor shall provide actual measurement results obtained for 100 
percent of the contract quantity.

If the inspection/test report is not available from the manufacturer, the 
Contractor shall have the inspection performed, at the Contractor's expense, 
either at his own facility or at a facility acceptable to the QAR.

The Bidder/Contractor hereby certifies that the stated unit price for each 
of the items identified above includes the Test Reports called up under 
this clause.
