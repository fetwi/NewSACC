<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Unless otherwise authorized by the responsible Commodity Team, use the following 
clause in multi-departmental (master) standing offers and supply arrangements 
when more than one department is identified as a user of the standing offer or 
supply arrangement.  Contracting officers must choose between the terms 
"Standing Offer" and "Supply Arrangement", and between the terms "Offeror" (for 
standing offers) and "Supplier" (for supply arrangements), as appropriate.  The 
contracting officer must attach a list of the data to be reported on by the 
contractor as an annex to the request for standing offer and standing offer 
documents, or the request for supply arrangement and supply arrangement 
documents.  The Value Management Office, Acquisition Renewal Sector, requires as 
a minimum the data elements that are detailed within the business volume report 
made available at the Standing Offer Index (http://soi.pwgsc.gc.ca).

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Offeror/Supplier must compile and maintain records on its provision of 
goods, services or both to the federal government under contracts resulting 
from the Standing Offer / Supply Arrangement.  This data must include all 
purchases ordered, including purchases paid for by a Government of Canada 
Acquisition Card.  The data must be aggregated and submitted on a quarterly 
basis to the Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) 
Contracting Authority responsible for the Standing Offer / Supply 
Arrangement.  The reported data must include the data shown at Annex "_____."

Quarterly periods are defined as follows: 

1st quarter: April 1, to June 30;
2nd quarter: July 1 to September 30;
3rd quarter: October 1 to December 31;
4th quarter: January 1 to March 31.

The reporting cut-off date for each quarter is the last Friday of the third 
calendar month of the quarter. Goods, services or both provided in the 
period after that day must be included in the next quarter's report. 
Electronic reports must be completed and forwarded to the PWGSC Contracting 
Authority no later than 15 calendar days after the end of the quarterly 
period.

All data fields of the report must be completed as requested.  If some data 
is not available, the reason must be indicated in the report.  If no goods 
or services are provided during a given period, the Offeror/Supplier must 
still provide a "NIL" report.

Failure to provide fully completed quarterly reports in accordance with the 
above instructions may result in the setting aside of the Standing Offer / 
Supply Arrangement and the application of a vendor performance corrective 
measure.
