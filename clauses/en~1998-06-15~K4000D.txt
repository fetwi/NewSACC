<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     <strong>Canadian Good</strong>: A good wholly manufactured or originating in Canada 
       is considered a Canadian good. A product containing imported 
       components may also be considered Canadian for the purpose of this 
       policy when it has undergone sufficient change in Canada, in a 
       manner that satisfies the definition specified under the North 
       American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Rules of Origin. For 
       photocopiers, computers and office equipment within Federal Supply 
       Classification (FSC) groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products of 
       MERIT/CIRCLE firms or companies in Priority Group 1 prior to April 
       1992 are considered Canadian (see below the paragraph on MERIT 
       Partnership Program and CIRCLE Program). 

2.     <strong>Canadian Service</strong>: A service provided by an individual based in 
       Canada is considered a Canadian service. Where a requirement 
       consists of only one service, which is being provided by more than 
       one individual, the service will be considered Canadian if a minimum 
       of 80 percent of the total bid price for the service is provided by 
       individuals based in Canada.

3.     <strong>Variety of Goods</strong>: When requirements consist of more than one good:

       (a)    <strong>Aggregate Evaluation</strong>: no less than 80 percent of the total 
              bid price must consist of Canadian goods; or,

       (b)    <strong>Item by Item Evaluation</strong>: in some cases, the bid evaluation 
              may be conducted on an item-by-item basis and contracts may 
              be awarded to more than one supplier. In these cases, 
              suppliers will be asked to identify separately each item that 
              meets the definition of Canadian goods.

4.     <strong>Variety of Services</strong>: For requirements consisting of more than one 
       service, a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price must be 
       provided by personnel based in Canada.

5.     <strong>Mix of Goods and Services</strong>: Except for science and technology 
       requirements (see paragraph 6 (a) below), when requirements consist 
       of a mix of goods and services, no less than 80 percent of the total 
       bid price must consist of Canadian Goods and Canadian Services (as 
       defined above). 
6.     <strong>Other Canadian Goods and Services</strong>:

       (a)    <strong>Science and Technology Contracting-Out Policy</strong>: Treasury 
              Board's Science and Technology Contracting-Out Policy sets 
              out the basis for competing the science and technology 
              requirements of the federal government.  Science and 
              technology requirements may be sourced exclusively from 
              Canadian suppliers. The percentage of the total bid price 
              that must consist of Canadian goods and/or services will be 
              80 percent, unless otherwise stated in the Notice of Proposed 
              Procurement (NPP) and solicitation document.

       (b)    <strong>MERIT Partnership Program and CIRCLE Program</strong>: For 
              photocopiers, computers and office equipment within FSC 
              groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products of the following 
              firms are considered Canadian goods:

              (1)    MERIT Partners under the MERIT Partnership Program 
                     (sponsored by Industry Canada (IC));

              (2)    Companies which, on March 31, 1992, were allocated to 
                     Priority Group 1 under the Priority Groups Policy in 
                     effect at that time; or

              (3)    CIRCLE companies as agreed on by IC and Department of 
                     Public Works and Government Services

              Technologies Industry Branch, Ottawa, Ontario, (613) 952-8420.

       (c)    Motor Vehicles: Motor vehicles are considered to be Canadian 
              goods for the purpose of the Canadian Content policy if they 
              qualify for purchase under the provisions identifying 
              vehicles normally purchased in Canada as set out in<em> Treasury 
              Board Manual, Information and Administrative Management, 
              Materiel, Risk and Common Services</em>, Part I, Chapter 2.

       (d)    Textiles: Textiles are considered to be Canadian goods 
              according to a modified rule of origin, copies of which are

              and Commercial Products and Standardization Services Sector.
