              Note:  In the United States, the export tariff is commonly

                     <strong>http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/schedules/

       (iv)   the number of pieces or cases;

              Canadian Dangerous Goods Shipping regulations.

       The Contractor shall report separately any piece measuring over 2.74

       requirement for specific consignee address labelling, the marking of 
       each piece with a Transportation Control Number and customs 
       documentation.

(d)    Under no circumstances shall the Contractor ship goods prior to

(e)    Should the Contractor deliver the goods at a place and time which 
       are not in accordance with the given delivery instructions or fail 
       to fulfil reasonable delivery instructions given by Canada, the 
       Contractor shall reimburse Canada any additional expenses and costs 
       thereby incurred.

(f)    Should delays by Canada delay delivery of the goods, ownership and

       GBP (pound sterling) being exported from the UK will require the 
       shipment to be correctly cleared using Her Majesty's Customs &amp; 
       Excise (HMCE) New Export Systems (NES).  Contractors must comply 
       with HMCE requirements by registering with HMCE or by having a 
       freight forwarder complete the entry.  A printed copy of the NES 
       entry "Export Declaration" clearly displaying the "Declaration 
       Unique Consignment Reference Number" must be provided by Contractors 
       and attached to the consignment.  It is the Contractor's 
       responsibility to ensure that this procedure is carried out for all 
       stores whether they be initial purchase or repair and overhaul 
       export items.  If this procedure is NOT adhered to completely and 
       properly, HMCE has instructed CFSU(E) that CFSU(E) cannot arrange 
       shipping of the consignment without the required documentation.
