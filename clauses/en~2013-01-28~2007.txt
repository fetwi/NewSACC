<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated
expenditure specified in a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) are
only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing
offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A
standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a
Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to
departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not
constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods,
services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or
several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2>01 (2012-11-09) Code of Conduct and Certifications - Offer </h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Offerors must comply with the Code of Conduct for Procurement. In addition to the Code of Conduct for Procurement, offerors must a) respond to Requests for Standing Offers (RFSO) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, b) accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>s, Standing Offers and resulting contracts, c) submit offers and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.</li>
<li>Offerors further understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be issued a Standing Offer and awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada. If it is determined, after issuance of a Standing Offer, that the Offeror made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to set aside the Standing Offer and to terminate for default any resulting contracts. The Offeror will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested. The Offeror and any of the Offeror's affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any Standing Offer arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer.</li>
<li>
For the purpose of this section, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Offeror's affiliates if: 
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li>a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in this section which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Offerors who are incorporated, including those submitting offers as a joint venture, must provide with their offer or promptly thereafter a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Offeror.  Offerors submitting offers as sole proprietorship, including those submitting offers as a joint venture, must provide with their offer or promptly thereafter the name of the owner.  Offerors submitting offers as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.  If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of offers is completed, Canada will inform the Offeror of a time frame within which to provide the information.  Failure to comply will render the offer non-responsive.  Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for a Standing Offer to be issued.
</p>
<p>
Canada may, at any time, request that an Offeror provide properly completed and Signed Consent Forms (Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229) for any or all individuals aforementioned within the time specified.  Failure to provide such Consent Forms within the time period provided will result in the offer being declared non-responsive.
</p>
</li>
<li>The Offeror must diligently maintain an up-to-date list of names by informing Canada in writing of any change occurring during the validity period of the offer as well as during the period of any Standing Offer arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer. The Offeror must also, when so requested, provide Canada with the corresponding Consent Forms.</li>
<li>By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that it is aware, and that its affiliates are aware, that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility.  Canada may also verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li>By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Standing Offer and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the  Lobbying Act.</li>
<li>
By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a) or b) are to receive any benefit under a Standing Offer arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer.  In addition, the Offeror certifies that except for those offences where a criminal pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's affiliates has ever been convicted of an offence under any of the following provisions: 
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>), subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the Financial Administration Act, or</li>

<li>section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</cite>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In circumstances where a criminal pardon or a record suspension has been obtained, or capacities have been restored by the Governor in Council, the Offeror must provide with its offer or promptly thereafter a copy of confirming documentation from an official source.  If such documentation has not been received by the time the evaluation of offers is completed, Canada will inform the Offeror of a time frame within which to provide the information.  Failure to comply will render the offer non-responsive</li>
<li>
Offerors understand that Canada may contract outside of the present solicitation process with a supplier who has been convicted of an offense enumerated under c) to h) of the paragraph hereinabove, or who is affiliated with someone who has been convicted of an offense enumerated under c) to h) of the paragraph hereinabove, when required to do so by law or legal proceedings, or when Canada considers it necessary to the public interest for reasons which include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Only one person is capable of performing the contract;</li>
<li>Emergency;</li>
<li>National security;</li>
<li>Health and safety;</li>
<li>Economic harm.</li>
</ul>

Canada reserves the right to impose additional conditions or measures to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.

Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which
renders the Offeror ineligible to submit an offer for the
requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the

the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which would render that employee or

perform;</li>
