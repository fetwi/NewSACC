The Bidder must comply with the Policy and Directives, which can be found at <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em>. </li>
<li>Under the Policy, charges and convictions of certain offences against a Bidder, its affiliates or first tier subcontractors, and other circumstances, will or may result in a determination by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) that the Bidder is ineligible to enter, or is suspended from entering into a contract with Canada. The list of ineligible and suspended Suppliers is contained in <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Integrity Database.

Pursuant to the Policy, Canada may also determine the Bidder to be ineligible for award of a contract for providing a false or misleading certification or declaration.</li>

<li>the Bidder's bidding privileges are suspended or are in the process of being suspended;</li>

      <ol type="a">
<li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees was involved in any manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li>if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees had access to information related to the bid solicitation that was not available to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The experience acquired by a Bidder who is providing or has provided the goods and services described in the bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating a conflict of interest. This Bidder remains however subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li>Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
</ol>
