       or completed vessels, and the cost of any repairs thereto occasioned 
       by or in connection with the demonstration or test or trials thereof 
       shall be part of the cost of the work under the contract and the 
       Contractor shall be reimbursed therefor under and in accordance with 
       the provisions hereof, unless the character and total value thereof 
       shall, in the opinion of the Minister, clearly indicate gross 
       mismanagement, wilful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part 
       of the Contractor.

shall be complied with by the Contractor.  The Contractor may, with the 
written approval of the Minister, make any such modifications, changes or 
additions to the specifications.  Should any such suspension, modification, 
change or addition result in a material increase or decrease in the scope 
of the work, the Minister may make an adjustment in the Contractor's fee, 
and the Minister's decision as to the adjustment to be made shall be final.


<strong>1033   10     (01/06/91)    Certificates Required</strong>

       conditions) of or to the work or any part thereof until delivery of 
       the vessels and final acceptance of same pursuant to the provisions 
       hereof.  If any such loss or damage should occur prior to such

       subject to such conditions as the Minister or the Inspector may 
       impose) at its own expense and without making any claim for

       any part thereof, whether by the Contractor or by any subcontractor 
       or assignee of the Contractor.

3.     The Contractor shall not (except as and to the extent, if any, 
       specifically required or permitted by the agreement), unless 
       otherwise directed by the Minister, carry, or incur the expense of,

       of the work (except to the extent, if any, to which the Contractor 
       is for the time being directed or permitted hereunder to carry 
       insurance) as would have been assumed by the underwriters if the 
       work had been insured throughout the term of the contract for full 
       value under the form of builders' risk policy set forth in standard 
       form of Marine Builders' Risk Policy, forming part of the contract,

       proceed with such defence.

5.     Her Majesty shall be entitled or subrogated to all rights and 
       remedies of the Contractor and/or any subcontractor against third 
       parties in respect of any loss or damage, the risk of which is 
       assumed by Her Majesty hereunder, and the Contractor and/or the said 
       subcontractors shall, at the expense of Her Majesty, do, concur in 
       doing and permit to be done all such acts and things as may be 
       necessary or as the Minister may direct or require for the purpose 
       of enforcing such rights and remedies.

6.     If the work or any part thereof shall be lost or damaged by reason 
       of anything the risk whereof is assumed by Her Majesty hereunder, 
       then the Contractor shall, if the Minister so directs, with all 
       possible speed and with equivalent materials and workmanship, repair, 
       rebuild or replace the same in the like state and condition in every

       reasonable and proper net cost of such repair, rebuilding or 
       replacement (calculated and determined in accordance with the 
       Contract Cost Principles, form DSS-MAS 1031-2, forming part of the 
       contract) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Contractor as herein 
       provided in respect of the cost of the work, and, in case such loss 
       or damage shall have happened without the actual fault or privity of 
       the Contractor, Her Majesty will pay to the Contractor, in addition 
       to such cost, a profit or fee in such amount as the Minister shall 
       consider reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances.

7.     The term "work" and other words relative thereto, or of like "import
       ", wherever used in this section, shall be deemed to include 
       government issue and any other property owned by Her Majesty which

              launched a vessel of the same class at its shipyard; or
 
       (b)    if the Contractor is directed by the owner department to 
              submit such calculations.

2.     Neither the submission of launching calculations to the Inspector or 
       to the owner department nor concurrence therein by the Inspector or 
       the owner department shall be deemed to be concurrence by Her 
       Majesty in the adequacy of such calculations.


<strong>1033   17     (01/06/91)    Public Ceremonies</strong>

The Contractor shall not allow any public ceremony in connection with the 
work without having previously obtained the written approval of the

Contractor in a suitable berth where the vessel cannot touch the ground at 
any time, unless prior approval shall have been obtained by the Contractor 
from the Inspector for the use of a particular berth where the vessel may 
touch bottom.  No berth shall be considered a suitable berth unless prior 
approval thereof, having regard to the size of the vessel, shall have been 
received from the Inspector.

vessel and for tests and trials, the vessel shall be dry-docked for survey 
at any time if required by the Minister or the Inspector.


<strong>1033   20     (01/06/91)    Commissioning of Vessel</strong>

Her Majesty may commission the vessel before or during trials and shall not, 
by reason thereof, be deemed to have accepted the vessel.


<strong>1033   21     (01/06/91)    Storage of Materials, Components, etc.</strong>

1.     The Contractor shall supply suitable warehouse accommodation for the 
       storage of all materials, components and equipment regardless of the 
       source of supply thereof, for such length of time as the Minister 
       may direct.
 
2.     Without limiting the Contractor's responsibility, as provided in the 
       contract, for the care of materials, components and equipment in its 
       custody or control, the Contractor shall carry out such maintenance, 
       care, minor repairs, calibration, adjustment, handling, embarking, 
       loading, care after loading and similar duties in respect of 
       materials, components and equipment in the custody or control of the

       instructions as may be given to the Contractor in writing by the 
       Minister or the Inspector.

2.     The Contractor shall be in charge of the vessel, including the 
       machinery and the electrical installations thereof, and shall

       shall have access to any part of the vessel.  The owner department 
       shall designate one of such personnel (who may or may not be the 
       Inspector) to be the owner department representative, and the 
       Contractor shall appoint one of its personnel to be its senior 
       representative.  All owner department personnel will observe the 
       manner in which the Contractor conducts the trials and in the event 
       of danger to the ship or its machinery or equipment or to life and 
       property, they will report to the Contractor's senior representative 
       and to the owner department representative.  The Contractor shall 
       comply with any instructions which may be given by the owner 
       department representative to the Contractor's senior representative
