<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in competitive bid solicitations.
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>All enquiries regarding the bid solicitation must be submitted in writing 
to the Contracting Authority named on page one (1) of this document as 
early as possible within the bidding period. Enquiries must be received no 
less than _____ calendar days prior to the bid closing date to allow 
sufficient time to provide a response.  Enquiries received after that time 
may not be able to be answered prior to the bid closing date.

Issues concerning this procurement may be raised prior to bid closing date 
with the Contracting Authority in order to obtain general guidance.  Canada 
will examine the issues and will decide whether or not to amend the 
solicitation document. 

To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to bidders, the 
Contracting Authority will provide, simultaneously to all companies to 
which this solicitation has been sent, any information with respect to 
significant enquiries received and the replies to such enquiries without 
revealing the sources of the enquiries.

All enquiries and other communications with government officials throughout 
the solicitation period are to be directed ONLY to the Contracting 
Authority named on page one of the bid solicitation.  Non-compliance with 
this condition during the bid solicitation period can (for that reason 
alone) result in disqualification of your bid.  Issues or deviations to 
mandatory requirements raised in the supplier's bid will not be considered 
or accepted, and will render the bid non responsive.
