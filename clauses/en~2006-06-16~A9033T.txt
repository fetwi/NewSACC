<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>In order to confirm a bidder's financial capability to perform the Contract, 
the Contracting Authority may during the bid evaluation phase, request from 
that bidder current financial information.  The requested financial 
information may include, but is not limited to, a bidder's most recent 
audited financial statements or financial statements certified by a bidder'
s chief financial officer.  The information provided will be considered in 
the bid evaluation and selection process.  If a bid is found to be 
non-responsive on the basis that a bidder is considered financially 
incapable of performing the Contract, that bidder will receive a written 
notification from the Contracting Authority.

Should a bidder provide the requested information to Canada in confidence 
   while indicating that the disclosed information is confidential, Canada 
   will treat the information in a confidential manner in accordance with 
   the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, R.S. 1985, c.A-1.
