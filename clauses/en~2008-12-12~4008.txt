<p>To perform the Work, the Contractor will be provided with and/or
will be collecting Personal Information from third parties. The
Contractor acknowledges that it has no rights in the Personal
Information or the Records and that Canada owns the Records. On
request, the Contractor must make all the Personal Information and

provided this information to the Contractor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor, its subcontractors, and their
respective employees must identify themselves to the individuals

those individuals with a way to verify that they are authorized to
collect the Personal Information under a Contract with Canada.</li>
<li value="3">If requested by the Contracting Authority, the
Contractor must develop a request for consent form to be used when
collecting Personal Information, or a script for collecting the
Personal Information by telephone. The Contractor must not begin
using a form or script unless the Contracting Authority first
approves it in writing. The Contractor must also obtain the
Contracting Authority's approval before making any changes to a
form or script.</li>
<li value="4">At the time it requests Personal Information from any
individual, if the Contractor doubts that the individual has the

Personal Information, the Contractor must ask the Contracting
Authority for instructions.</li>

Information;</li>
<li value="2">segregate all Records from the Contractor's own
information and records;</li>
<li value="3">restrict access to the Personal Information and the
Records to people who require access to perform the Work (for
example, by using passwords or biometric access controls);</li>
<li value="4">provide training to anyone to whom the Contractor
will provide access to the Personal Information regarding the
obligation to keep it confidential and use it only to perform the
Work. The Contractor must provide this training before giving an
individual access to any Personal Information and the Contractor
must keep a record of the training and make it available to the
Contracting Authority if requested;</li>
<li value="5">if requested by the Contracting Authority, before
providing anyone with access to the Personal Information, require
anyone to whom the Contractor provides access to the Personal
Information to acknowledge in writing (in a form approved by the
Contracting Authority) their responsibilities to maintain the
privacy of the Personal Information;</li>

to review his or her Personal Information, and any requests to
correct errors or omissions in the Personal Information (whether
those requests are made directly by an individual or by Canada on
behalf of an individual);</li>
<li value="7">include a notation on any Record(s) that an
individual has requested be corrected if the Contractor has decided
not to make the correction for any reason. Whenever this occurs,

biometric access) is required to access the system or database in
which the Personal Information is stored;</li>
<li value="2">ensure that passwords or other access controls are
provided only to individuals who require access to the Personal
Information to perform the Work;</li>
<li value="3">not outsource the electronic storage of Personal
Information to a third party (including an affiliate) unless the

updated at least weekly;</li>
<li value="6">implement any reasonable security or protection
