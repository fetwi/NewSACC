<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If specific individuals are identified in the
Contract to perform the Work, the Contractor must provide the
services of those individuals unless the Contractor is unable to do
so for reasons beyond its control.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor is unable to provide the services
of any specific individual identified in the Contract, it must
provide a replacement with similar qualifications and experience.
The replacement must meet the criteria used in the selection of the
Contractor and be acceptable to Canada. The Contractor must, as
soon as possible, give notice to the Contracting Authority of the
reason for replacing the individual and provide:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the name, qualifications and experience of the
proposed replacement; and</li>
<li value="2">proof that the proposed replacement has the required
security clearance granted by Canada, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor must not, in any event, allow
performance of the Work by unauthorized replacement persons. The
Contracting Authority may order that a replacement stop performing
the Work. In such a case, the Contractor must immediately comply
with the order and secure a further replacement in accordance with
subsection 2. The fact that the Contracting Authority does not
order that a replacement stop performing the Work does not relieve
the Contractor from its responsibility to meet the requirements of
the Contract.</li>
