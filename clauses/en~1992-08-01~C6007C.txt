<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Her Majesty's liability to the Carrier under this contract shall not exceed $ _____ 
unless otherwise authorized in writing by this Department. The Carrier 
shall not be obliged to perform any work or provide any services which 
would cause the total liability of Her Majesty to exceed the sum, unless an 
increase is so authorized by this Department. The Carrier shall notify this 
Department as to the adequacy of this sum when it is 75% committed, or four 
months prior to the estimated date of completion of the contract, whichever 
comes first. However, if at any time the Carrier considers that the said 
sum may be exceeded, the Carrier will promptly notify this Department.

No increase in the total liability of Her Majesty or in the price of the 
work or services resulting from any design changes, modifications or 
interpretations of the specifications, will be authorized or paid to the 
Carrier unless such design changes, modifications or interpretations shall 
have been approved by this Department prior to their incorporation into the 
work.
