some suppliers, including a supplier who is a member of a joint
venture, bidding for federal government contracts, valued at
$200,000 or more (including all applicable taxes), make a formal
commitment to implement employment equity. This is a condition
precedent to contract award. If the Bidder, or, if the Bidder is a
joint venture and if any member of the joint venture, is subject to
the <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">FCP</abbr>, evidence of its commitment must be provided before the
award of the Contract.

Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer
eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold for

either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, or
following their voluntary withdrawal from the <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">FCP</abbr> for a reason
other than the reduction of their workforce to less than 100
