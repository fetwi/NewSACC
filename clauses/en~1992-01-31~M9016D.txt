<pre>Task(s) will be called-up by the Project Authority as follows:

The Project Authority will provide the Offerer with a description of the 
work to be performed.

The Offerer will submit (a proposal including) a (firm/ceiling) price and a 
delivery schedule for each task with supporting details to the Project 
Authority.

The (firm/ceiling) price for each task will be established by multiplying 
the applicable rate(s) as shown under the Basis of Payment by the number 
(hours/days/units) agreed upon by the Project Authority and the Offerer.

Ceiling price will be used instead of firm price only in cases where the 
work to be performed is not in sufficient detail to accurately determine a 
reasonable firm price.

The Offerer will be authorized verbally by the Project Authority to proceed 
with the task(s). Formal confirmation will follow by issuance of form 
DSS-MAS 942 (Requisition Against a Standing Offer).

The Offerer will be authorized by the Project Authority to proceed with the

   Offer).
