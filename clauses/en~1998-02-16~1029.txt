only as approved by the Inspector.


<strong>1029   04     (01/06/91)    Inspector Final Judge of Work, Materials, Etc.</strong>

If any part of the specifications provides for a method of construction or 
for the supply and/or use of materials, equipment or parts which are not

selection provided that the construction so performed and the materials, 
equipment and parts so supplied and/or used are in accordance with normal 
marine building practice for the type and class of <em>vessel</em>s covered by the 
contract, and provided that the specifications and all other contract 
requirements are fully complied with. Subject to the foregoing, the 
Inspector shall be the final judge of the quality, quantity and suitability

and equipment used in or for the purposes of the work and as to the meaning 
or interpretation of the specifications and his decision with regard to the

       including wharfage, towage, dockage, running lines, electric light 
       and water for testing and refilling the tanks.

       all the provisions imposed upon him by this contract, the Contractor 
       will reimburse Her Majesty within thirty (30) days thereafter for 
       any such assessments, taxes, duties, levies or charges as may have

<strong>1029   08     (01/06/91)    Where Vessel Remains in Commission</strong>
 
1.     If the <em>vessel</em> is to remain in commission while the work is being 
       carried out, then

       (a)    the work shall be carried out on the <em>vessel</em> at such place as 
              the <em>vessel</em> is from time to time berthed, provided that every 
              endeavour shall be made consistent with the necessity for 
              speedy execution of the work to have the <em>vessel</em> berthed at 
              such place as will facilitate the work required to be 
              performed thereon by the Contractor;

       (b)    the Contractor shall not be in charge of or responsible for 
              the care and protection of the <em>vessel</em> but shall be liable for 
              all loss or damage or personal injury (to persons other than 
              those in the employ of the Contractor) resulting from any 
              negligent or wrongful act or omission on the part of the 
              Contractor, its officers, servants, agents or employees 
              during the carrying out of the work.  If any such loss or 
              damage should occur to the <em>vessel</em> or to the work, the 
              Contractor shall forthwith, unless otherwise directed by the 
              Minister or the Inspector and subject to such conditions as 
              the Minister or the Inspector may impose, at its own expense, 
              repair, restore and/or replace the <em>vessel</em> and/or the work so

              loss, damages, costs and expenses arising from or in any way 
              connected with any and all claims for or in respect of such 
              loss, damages or personal injuries occasioned as aforesaid.  


<strong>1029   09     (01/06/91)    Where Vessel out of Commission</strong>

1.     If the <em>vessel</em> be out of commission while the work is being carried 
       out, then

       (a)    unless the prior approval of the Minister has been obtained 
              to ground the <em>vessel</em>, it shall be berthed where it will not 
              touch the ground at either high or low water;

       (b)    the Contractor shall be in charge of and be entirely 
              responsible for the care and efficient protection of the <em>
              vessel</em> from the time of delivery thereof to the Contractor 
              until redelivered to and accepted by the person or persons 
              appointed by the Minister to receive and accept the same;

       (c)    a copy of all lists of fixtures and spare gear will be 
              furnished to the Contractor who shall check the same in 
              conjunction with the Inspector and thereafter acknowledge 
              receipt of the items set forth therein; upon completion of 
              the work, if such items are accounted for to the satisfaction 
              of the Inspector, a clearance will be given to the Contractor;

       (d)    the Contractor shall provide the necessary warehouse or 
              storage accommodation for and maintain in good conditions, 
              lubricated, painted and protected from the weather, all 
              equipment, fittings, articles or things temporarily removed 
              from the <em>vessel</em> during the work or which may be supplied to 
              the Contractor by Her Majesty for stowing or fitting in place 
              on board the <em>vessel</em> prior to delivery thereof to Her Majesty, 
              and shall redeliver the same to Her Majesty in as good 
              condition as when so removed by or supplied to the Contractor.  
              The Contractor shall also provide safe storage accommodation 
              for any part or parts of the <em>vessel</em> permanently removed until 
              the same are disposed of as hereinbefore provided;

       (e)    the Contractor shall take the usual and proper precautions to 
              maintain in a proper state of preservation any machinery, 
              equipment, fittings, stores or things left in the <em>vessel</em> 
              which might become damaged by exposure;

       (f)    if the work hereunder necessitates the removal of stores and 
              no secure place of stowage is available on board the <em>vessel</em>, 
              the Contractor shall provide the necessary labour for removal 
              and a secure place for storage.  The Contractor shall furnish 
              receipts for such stores.  The Contractor undertakes that 
              such stores shall be well and carefully stored and not

       (g)    the Contractor shall be liable for all loss or damage of or 
              to the <em>vessel</em> or the work and for personal injury (to persons

              from any negligent or wrongful act or omission on the part of 
              the Contractor, its officers, servants, agents or employees 
              from the time of the taking over of the <em>vessel</em> until delivery 
              of the <em>vessel</em> and final acceptance of the work pursuant to 
              the provisions hereof.  If any such loss or damage should 
              occur prior to such delivery and final acceptance, the 
              Contractor shall forthwith (unless otherwise directed by the 
              Minister or the Inspector and subject to such conditions as 
              the Minister or the Inspector may impose), at its own expense, 
              repair, restore and/or replace the <em>vessel</em> and/or the work so 
              lost or damaged. Neither Her Majesty nor the Minister shall 
              be in any manner responsible or liable for any loss or damage 
              which shall or may happen to the <em>vessel</em> and/or the work, or 
              any part or parts thereof (prior to delivery as herein 
              provided), or for any injury including injuries resulting in 
              death, to any person or persons, or for any other damages or 
              injuries whatsoever, caused by or in connection with the <em>
              vessel</em>, or caused by or resulting from or in any way arising 
              out of the work, and the Contractor shall indemnify and save 
              harmless Her Majesty and the Minister against and from all 
              loss, costs, damages and expenses arising from or in any way 
              connected with any and all claims for or in respect of such 
              loss, damages or injuries.  


<strong>1029   10     (01/06/91)    Insurance</strong>

The Contractor warrants that it is carrying Shipbuilders' and/or Ship 
Repairers' Liability insurance in the amount stated in the agreement and 
hereby agrees to maintain the said insurance in force during the carrying 
out of the contract; and the Contractor further agrees that, in the event 
of any loss or liability covered by the said insurance being suffered or 
incurred by or in relation to the <em>vessel</em> or to the work, the said insurance 
shall be available for the benefit of Her Majesty as Her Majesty's interest 
may appear.


<strong>1029   11     (01/06/91)    Public Ceremony</strong>

The Contractor shall not allow any public ceremony in connection with the 
work without having previously obtained the written permission of the 
Minister.


<strong>1029   12     (01/06/91)    Security Deposit</strong>

1.     The security (if any) referred to in the agreement shall be held and 
       retained by Her Majesty as security for the due and complete 
       performance, observance and fulfilment by the Contractor of all the 
       covenants and provisions of the contract.  Unless and until the 
       security is forfeited to Her Majesty as herein provided, Her Majesty 
       shall remit any revenues and income therefrom (provided that Her 
       Majesty shall in no event be obligated to invest moneys as interest 
       or otherwise) to the Contractor, and in the case of interest coupons, 
       or dividend coupons payable to bearer, shall deliver the same to the 
       Contractor as and when they mature.  In the event of any default by 
       the Contractor in fulfilment of any of the terms and conditions of 
       the contract, the security shall (without prejudice to any and all 
       other rights and recourses accruing to Her Majesty) be forfeited to 
       and retained by Her Majesty as liquidated damages and not as a 
       penalty but, if the Contractor shall have duly performed, observed 
       and fulfilled all the covenants, terms and conditions of the 
       contract, the security shall be returned to the Contractor.
 
2.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Minister may, at his discretion, 
       authorize a return of the security to the Contractor at any time 
       before the Contractor has fulfilled all its obligations under the 
       contract.  In such event, the return of the security shall not 
       prejudice any rights or recourse accruing to Her Majesty under the 
       contract.
