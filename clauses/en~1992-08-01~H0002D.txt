<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>(a)    i)     In this Article an amount is "due and payable" when it is due 
              and payable by Canada to the Carrier according to the terms 
              of the Contract.

       ii)    For the purposes of this Article, an amount is overdue when 
              it is unpaid on the first day following the day upon which it 
              is due and payable.

       iii)   In this Article "date of payment" means date of the 
              negotiable instrument drawn by the Receiver General for 
              Canada and given for payment of an amount due and payable.

       iv)    In this Article "Bank Rate" means the discount rate of 
              interest set by the Bank of Canada.

(b)    i)     Canada shall be liable to pay, without demand from the 
              Carrier, simple interest at the Bank Rate plus 1 1/4 per 
              centum on any amount which is overdue from the day such 
              amount became overdue until the day prior to the date of 
              payment, inclusively; however, interest will not be payable 
              nor paid unless the amount has been outstanding (unpaid) for 
              more than 15 days following the due date. Interest will not 
              be payable on overdue advance payments.

       ii)    The Bank Rate shall be that prevailing at the opening of 
              business on the date of payment.

       in paying the Carrier. In the event Canada is not responsible for 
       the delay in paying the Carrier, no interest shall be paid.
