<p>In the Standing Offer, unless the context otherwise
requires,</p>
<p><dfn>"Call-up"</dfn> means an order issued by an Identified User
duly authorized to issue a call-up against a particular standing
offer. Issuance of a call-up to the Offeror constitutes acceptance
of its offer and results in the creation of a contract between Her
Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Offeror for the goods,
services or both described in the Call-up;</p>
<p><dfn>"Canada"</dfn>, <dfn>"Crown"</dfn>, <dfn>"Her Majesty"</dfn> or <dfn>"the Government"</dfn>

the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and any other
person duly authorized to act on behalf of that Minister.</p>

provide goods, services or both to Canada under the Standing
Offer;</p>

Standing Offer;</p>
<p><dfn>"Standing Offer Authority"</dfn> means the person designated
as such in the Standing Offer, or by notice to the Offeror, to act
as the representative of Canada in the management of the Standing
Offer. The Standing Offer Authority will issue a document called
"Standing Offer and Call-up Authority" to authorize Identified
Users to make call-ups against the Standing Offer and to notify the
Offeror that authority to make call-ups against the Standing Offer
has been given to Identified Users.</p>
<h2>2005 02 (2006-08-15) General</h2>

goods, services or both specified in the Standing Offer by means of
any other contract, standing offer or contracting method.</p>
