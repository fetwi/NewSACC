<pre>The Trade-In Allowance has taken into consideration the fact that the used 
vehicle will be retained until the new vehicle is exchanged, and that no 
adjustment will be made to allow for depreciation arising out of normal 
wear and tear on the used vehicle between the time of appraisal and the 
time the new vehicle is exchanged. Any significant change in the condition 
of the trade-in vehicle must be reported by the fastest means to the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services Contracting Authority.
