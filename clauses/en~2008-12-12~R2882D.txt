<h2>GC8.1 (2008-05-12) Interpretation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">"<dfn>dispute</dfn>" means any disagreement regarding
any issue identified by the Contractor in the notice submitted to
Canada in accordance with paragraph 2 of GC8.3, "Notice of
Dispute", and includes any claim by the Contractor arising from
such disagreement and any counterclaim by Canada, but does not
include any claim by either party for punitive or exemplary
damages, injury to persons, death, or any claim based on an
allegation of libel or slander.</li>
<li value="2">The alternative dispute resolution procedures set out
in GC8, do not apply to any claim by Canada against the Contractor
except any counterclaim in a dispute as defined in paragraph 1 of
GC8.1, including, but not limited to, any claim of setoff regarding
any amount due to Canada under GC5.10, "Assessment and Damages for
Late Completion".</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC8.2 (2008-05-12) Consultation and Co-operation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The parties agree to maintain open and honest
communication throughout the performance of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">The parties agree to consult and co-operate with each
other in the furtherance of the Work and the resolution of problems
or differences that may arise.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC8.3 (2008-05-12) Notice of Dispute</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Any difference between the parties to the Contract of
any nature arising out of or in connection with the Contract which
could result in a claim by the Contractor against Canada, and which
is not settled by consultation and co-operation as envisaged in
GC8.2, "Consultation and Co-operation", shall be resolved in the
first instance by Canada, whose written decision or direction shall
be final and binding subject only to the provisions of GC8. Such
written decision or direction includes, but is not limited to, any
written decision or direction by Canada under any provision of the
General Conditions.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted the
decision or direction of Canada referred to in paragraph 1) of
GC8.3 and to have expressly waived and released Canada from any
claim in respect of the particular matter dealt with in that
decision or direction unless, within 15 working days after receipt
of the decision or direction, the Contractor submits to Canada a
written notice of dispute requesting formal negotiation under
GC8.4, "Negotiation". Such notice shall refer specifically to
GC8.4, "Negotiation", and shall specify the issues in contention
and the relevant provisions of the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">The giving of a written notice in accordance with
paragraph 2) of GC8.3 shall not relieve the Contractor from
complying with the decision or direction that is the subject of the
dispute. Such compliance, however, shall not be construed as an
admission by the Contractor of the correctness of such decision or
direction.</li>
<li value="4">If a dispute is not resolved promptly, Canada shall
give such instructions as, in Canada's opinion, are necessary for
the proper performance of the Work and to prevent delays pending a
resolution of the matter. Unless Canada terminates the Contract,
orders the Contractor to suspend the Work, or takes the Work out of
the hands of the Contractor, the Contractor shall continue to
perform the Work in accordance with the provisions and requirements
of the Contract and the instructions of Canada. Such performance
shall not prejudice any claim that the Contractor may have.</li>
<li value="5">Nothing in GC8 relieves the Contractor from its
obligation to provide any other notice required by the Contract
within the time specified in the Contract, including but not
limited to, any notice required under GC6.2, "Changes in Subsurface
Conditions".</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC8.4 (2008-12-12) Negotiation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Within 10 working days after receipt by Canada of a
notice referred to in paragraph 2) of GC8.3, "Notice of Dispute",
or within such other period of time as may be mutually agreed to,
the parties shall commence formal negotiations in order to resolve
the dispute. Negotiations shall occur initially between
representatives of the Contractor and Canada who play a direct
supervisory role in the performance, administration or management
of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">If the representatives referred to in paragraph 1) of
GC8.4 are unable to resolve some or all of the issues which are the
subject of the negotiations within 10 working days, the parties
shall refer the remaining issues which are in dispute to a second
level of negotiation between a principal or principals of the
Contractor and a senior level manager or senior level managers
representing Canada.</li>
<li value="3">If negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within 30
working days from the date of delivery of the notice referred to in
paragraph 2) of GC8.3, "Notice of Dispute", or within such longer
period as may have been agreed to by the parties, the Contractor
may, by giving written notice to Canada, in accordance with GC2.3,
"Notices", within 10 working days from the end of such period,
request that mediation be undertaken to assist the parties to reach
agreement on the outstanding issues.</li>
<li value="4">If the Contractor does not request mediation within
the period permitted by paragraph 3) of GC8.4, the Contractor shall
be deemed to have accepted the decision or direction of Canada
under paragraph 1) of GC8.3, "Notice of Dispute", and to have
expressly waived and released Canada from any claim in respect of
the particular matter dealt with in that decision or
direction.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC8.5 (2008-05-12) Mediation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the Contractor has requested mediation in
accordance with paragraph 3) of GC8.4, "Negotiation", mediation
shall be conducted in accordance with GC8.8, "Rules for Mediation
of Disputes".</li>
<li value="2">If a Project Mediator has not previously been
appointed for the purposes of the Contract, a Project Mediator
shall be appointed in accordance with GC8.8, "Rules for Mediation
of Disputes", forthwith after delivery of a notice in accordance
with paragraph 3) of GC8.4, "Negotiation", requesting
mediation.</li>
<li value="3">If the dispute has not been resolved within
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">10 working days following the appointment of a
Project Mediator in accordance with paragraph 2) of GC8.5, if a
Project Mediator was not previously appointed;</li>
<li value="2">10 working days following receipt by Canada of a
written notice in accordance with paragraph 3) of GC8.4,
"Negotiation", if a Project Mediator was previously appointed;
or</li>
<li value="3">such other longer period as may have been agreed to
by the parties;</li>
</ol>
the Project Mediator shall terminate the mediation by giving
written notice to the parties stating the effective date of
termination.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC8.6 (2008-05-12) Confidentiality</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All information exchanged during alternative dispute
resolution procedures, by whatever means, shall be without
prejudice and shall be treated as confidential by the parties and
their representatives, unless otherwise required by law. However,
evidence that is independently admissible or discoverable shall not
be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable by virtue of its use
during an alternative dispute resolution process.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC8.7 (2008-05-12) Settlement</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Any agreement to settle all or any part of a dispute,

private sector mediators obtained from an independent and impartial

parties, which contract shall incorporate or otherwise comply with

repeat the process with the second-highest common ranked
mediator.</li>
