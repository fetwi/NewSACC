<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-38.2/" rel="external">Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</a></cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr>, 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 16, the clauses and conditions
identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="powers-of-canada">2040 03 (2008-05-12) Powers of Canada</h2>
<p>All rights, remedies, powers and discretions granted or acquired
by Canada under the Contract or by law are cumulative, not
exclusive.</p>
<h2 id="status-of-the-contractor">2040 04 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent contractor engaged by Canada to
perform the Work. Nothing in the Contract is intended to create a
partnership, a joint venture or an agency between Canada and the
other Party or Parties. The Contractor must not represent itself as
an agent or representative of Canada to anyone. Neither the
Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee or
agent of Canada. The Contractor is responsible for all deductions
and remittances required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2 id="conduct-of-the-work">2040 05 (2012-03-02) Conduct of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor represents and warrants that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">it is competent to perform the Work;</li>
<li value="2">it has everything necessary to perform the Work,
including the resources, facilities, labour, technology, equipment,
and materials; and</li>
<li value="3">it has the necessary qualifications, including
knowledge, skill, know-how and experience, and the ability to use
them effectively to perform the Work.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">perform the Work diligently and efficiently;</li>
<li value="2">except for Government Property, supply everything
necessary to perform the Work;</li>
<li value="3">use, as a minimum, quality assurance procedures,
inspections and controls generally used and recognized by the
industry to ensure the degree of quality required by the
Contract;</li>
<li value="4">select and employ a sufficient number of qualified
people;</li>
<li value="5">perform the Work in accordance with standards of
quality acceptable to Canada and in full conformity with the
Specifications and all the requirements of the Contract;</li>
<li value="6">provide effective and efficient supervision to ensure
that the quality of workmanship meets the requirements of the
Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">The Work must not be performed by any person who, in the opinion of Canada, is incompetent, unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly.</li>
<li value="4">All services rendered under the Contract must, at the
time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform
to the requirements of the Contract. If the Contractor must correct
or replace the Work or any part of the Work, it will be at no cost
to Canada.</li>
<li value="5">Canada's facilities, equipment and personnel are not
available to the Contractor to perform the Work unless the Contract
specifically provides for it. The Contractor is responsible for
advising the Contracting Authority in advance if it requires access
to Canada's facilities, equipment or personnel to perform the Work.
The Contractor must comply and ensure that its employees and
subcontractors comply with all security measures, standing orders,
policies or other rules in force at the site where the Work is
performed.</li>
<li value="6">Unless the Contracting Authority orders the
Contractor to suspend the Work or part of the Work pursuant to
section 39, the Contractor must not stop or suspend the Work or
part of the Work pending the settlement of any dispute between the
Parties about the Contract.</li>
<li value="7">The Contractor must provide all reports that are
required by the Contract and any other information that Canada may
reasonably require from time to time.</li>
<li value="8">The Contractor is fully responsible for performing
the Work. Canada will not be responsible for any negative
consequences or extra costs if the Contractor follows any advice
given by Canada, unless the Contracting Authority provides the
advice to the Contractor in writing and includes a statement
specifically relieving the Contractor of any responsibility for
negative consequences or extra costs that might result from
following the advice.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="subcontracts">2040 06 (2013-06-27) Subcontracts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Except as provided in subsection 2, the Contractor
must obtain the Contracting Authority's written consent before
subcontracting or permitting the subcontracting of any part of the
Work. A subcontract includes a contract entered into by any
subcontractor at any tier to perform any part of the Work.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor is not required to obtain consent for
subcontracts specifically authorized in the Contract. The
Contractor may also without the consent of the Contracting
Authority:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">purchase "off-the-shelf" items and any standard
articles and materials that are ordinarily produced by
manufacturers in the normal course of business;</li>
<li value="2">subcontract any incidental services that would
ordinarily be subcontracted in performing the Work;</li>
<li value="3">in addition to purchases and services referred to in
paragraphs (a) and (b), subcontract any part or parts of the Work
to one or more subcontractors up to a total value of 40 percent of
the Contract Price; and</li>
<li value="4">permit its subcontractors at any tier to make
purchases or subcontract as permitted in paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">In any subcontract other than a subcontract referred
to in paragraph 2.(a), the Contractor must, unless the Contracting
Authority agrees in writing, ensure that the subcontractor is bound
by conditions compatible with and, in the opinion of the
Contracting Authority, not less favourable to Canada than the
conditions of the Contract, with the exception of requirements under the Federal Contractors Program for employment equity which only apply to the Contractor.</li>
<li value="4">Even if Canada consents to a subcontract, the
Contractor is responsible for performing the Contract and Canada is
not responsible to any subcontractor. The Contractor is responsible
for any matters or things done or provided by any subcontractor
under the Contract and for paying any subcontractors for any part
of the Work they perform.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specifications">2040 07 (2008-05-12) Specifications</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All Specifications provided by Canada or on behalf of
Canada to the Contractor in connection with the Contract belong to
Canada and must be used by the Contractor only for the purpose of
performing the Work.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contract provides that Specifications
furnished by the Contractor must be approved by Canada, that
approval will not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to
meet all requirements of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="condition-of-material">2040 08 (2008-05-12) Condition of Material</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, material supplied
must be new and conform to the latest issue of the applicable
drawing, specifications and part number that is in effect on the
bid closing date or, if there was no bid solicitation, the date of
the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="replacement-of-specific-individuals">2040 09 (2008-05-12) Replacement of Specific Individuals</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If specific individuals are identified in the
Contract to perform the Work, the Contractor must provide the
services of those individuals unless the Contractor is unable to do
so for reasons beyond its control.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor is unable to provide the services
of any specific individual identified in the Contract, it must
provide a replacement with similar qualifications and experience.
The replacement must meet the criteria used in the selection of the
Contractor and be acceptable to Canada. The Contractor must, as
soon as possible, give notice to the Contracting Authority of the
reason for replacing the individual and provide:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the name, qualifications and experience of the
proposed replacement; and</li>
<li value="2">proof that the proposed replacement has the required
security clearance granted by Canada, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor must not, in any event, allow
performance of the Work by unauthorized replacement persons. The
Contracting Authority may order that a replacement stop performing
the Work. In such a case, the Contractor must immediately comply
with the order and secure a further replacement in accordance with
subsection 2. The fact that the Contracting Authority does not
order that a replacement stop performing the Work does not relieve
the Contractor from its responsibility to meet the requirements of
the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="time-of-the-essence">2040 10 (2008-05-12) Time of the Essence</h2>
<p>It is essential that the Work be performed within or at the time
stated in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="excusable-delay">2040 11 (2014-09-25) Excusable Delay</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any
obligation under the Contract that is caused by an event that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">is beyond the reasonable control of the
Contractor,</li>
<li value="2">could not reasonably have been foreseen,</li>
<li value="3">could not reasonably have been prevented by means
reasonably available to the Contractor, and</li>
<li value="4">occurred without the fault or neglect of the
Contractor,</li>
</ol>
<p>will be considered an "Excusable Delay" if the Contractor
advises the Contracting Authority of the occurrence of the delay or
of the likelihood of the delay as soon as the Contractor becomes
aware of it. The Contractor must also advise the Contracting
Authority, within 15 working days, of all the
circumstances relating to the delay and provide to the Contracting
Authority for approval a clear work around plan explaining in
detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to
minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Any delivery date or other date that is directly
affected by an Excusable Delay will be postponed for a reasonable
time that will not exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="3">However, if an Excusable Delay has continued for 30 days or more, the Contracting Authority may, by giving
notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the Contract. In
such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim
against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other
loss arising out of the termination or the event that contributed
to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately
to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated
at the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Unless Canada has caused the delay by failing to meet
an obligation under the Contract, Canada will not be responsible
for any costs incurred by the Contractor or any of its
subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</li>
<li value="5">If the Contract is terminated under this section, the
Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to
Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting
Authority, any completed parts of the Work not delivered and
accepted before the termination and anything that the Contractor
has acquired or produced specifically to perform the Contract.
Canada will pay the Contractor:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the value, of all completed parts of the Work
delivered to and accepted by Canada, based on the Contract Price,
including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee
included in the Contract Price; and</li>
<li value="2">the Cost to the Contractor that Canada considers
reasonable in respect of anything else delivered to and accepted by
Canada.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The total amount paid by Canada under the Contract to the date
of termination and any amounts payable under this subsection must
not exceed the Contract Price.</p>
<h2 id="inspection-and-acceptance-of-the-work">2040 12 (2014-09-25) Inspection and Acceptance of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance
by Canada. Inspection and acceptance of the Work by Canada do not
relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for defects or other
failures to meet the requirements of the Contract. Canada will have
the right to reject any Work that is not in accordance with the
requirements of the Contract and require its correction or
replacement at the Contractor's expense.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must provide representatives of Canada
access to all locations where any part of the Work is being
performed at any time during working hours. Representatives of
Canada may make examinations and such tests of the Work as they may
think fit. The Contractor must provide all assistance and
facilities, test pieces, samples and documentation that the
representatives of Canada may reasonably require for the carrying
out of the inspection. The Contractor must forward such test pieces
and samples to such person or location as Canada specifies.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor must inspect and approve any part of
the Work before submitting it for acceptance or delivering it to
Canada. The Contractor must keep accurate and complete inspection
records that must be made available to Canada on request.
Representatives of Canada may make copies and take extracts of the
records during the performance of the Contract and for up to three years after the end of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="invoice-submission">2040 13 (2013-03-21) Invoice Submission</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name.
The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment;
invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must
indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</li>
<li value="2">Invoices must show:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the date, the name and address of the client
department, item or reference numbers, deliverable/description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number
(CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial
code(s);</li>
<li value="2">details of expenditures (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price, fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as applicable) in accordance with the Basis of Payment, exclusive of Applicable Taxes; </li>
<li value="3">deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li value="5">if applicable, the method of shipment together with
date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Applicable Taxes must be specified on all invoices as a separate item along with corresponding registration numbers from the tax authorities. All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which Applicable Taxes do not apply, must be identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li value="4">By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taxes">2040 14 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">
Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes.
</li>
<li value="2">
Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation. The Contractor agrees to remit to appropriate tax authorities any amounts of Applicable Taxes paid or due.
</li>
<li value="3">
The Contractor is not entitled to use Canada’s exemptions from any tax, such as provincial sales taxes, unless otherwise specified by law. The Contractor must pay applicable provincial sales tax, ancillary taxes, and any commodity tax, on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with applicable legislation), including for material incorporated into real property. 
</li>
<li value="4">
In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award. However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change. 
</li>
<li value="5">Tax Withholding of 15 Percent – Canada Revenue Agency 
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Act</a></cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Regulations</a></cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html" rel="external">Canada Revenue Agency</a></cite>. The amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.
</p>
<h2 id="transportation-costs">2040 15 (2010-01-11) Transportation Costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-carriers-liability">2040 16 (2010-01-11) Transportation Carriers' Liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2 id="shipment-documentation">2040 17 (2008-05-12) Shipment Documentation</h2>

The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the

as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31<sup>st</sup> day following that date and interest
will be paid automatically in accordance with section 19.</li>
<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
15 days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>

<li value="2">However if any payment is made to the Contractor for
or on account of any Work, either by way of progress or milestone
payments, that work paid for by Canada belongs to Canada upon such
payment being made. This transfer of ownership does not constitute
acceptance by Canada of the Work or any part of the Work and does
not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">Despite any transfer of ownership, the Contractor is
responsible for any loss or damage to the Work or any part of the
Work until it is delivered to Canada in accordance with the

all defects in design, material or workmanship, and will conform to
the requirements of the Contract. The warranty period begins on the
date of delivery, or if acceptance takes place at a later date, the
date of acceptance. With respect to Government Property not
supplied by the Contractor, the Contractor's warranty will extend
only to its proper incorporation into the Work.</li>
<li value="2">In the event of a defect or non-conformance in any
part of the Work during the warranty period, the Contractor, at the
request of Canada to do so, must as soon as possible repair,
replace or otherwise make good at its own option and expense the
part of the Work found to be defective or not in conformance with
the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">The Work or any part of the Work found to be
defective or non-conforming will be returned to the Contractor's
plant for replacement, repair or making good. However, when in the
opinion of Canada it is not expedient to remove the Work from its
location, the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or
making good of the Work at that location. In such cases, the
Contractor will be paid the fair and reasonable Cost (including
reasonable travel and living expenses) incurred in so doing, with
no allowance for profit, less an amount equal to the Cost of
rectifying the defect or non-conformance at the Contractor's
plant.</li>
<li value="4">Canada must pay the transportation cost associated
with returning the Work or any part of the Work to the Contractor's
plant pursuant to subsection 3. The Contractor must pay the

<li value="6">If the Contractor fails to fulfill any obligation
described in this section within a reasonable time of receiving a
notice, Canada will have the right to remedy or to have remedied
the defective or non-conforming work at the Contractor's expense.
If Canada does not wish to correct or replace the defective or
non-conforming work, an equitable reduction will be made in the
Contract Price.</li>
<li value="7">The warranty period is automatically extended by the
duration of any period or periods where the Work is unavailable for
use or cannot be used because of a defect or non-conformance during
the original warranty period. The warranty applies to any part of
the Work repaired, replaced or otherwise made good pursuant to
subsection 2, for the greater of:

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor represents and warrants that, to the
best of its knowledge, neither it nor Canada will infringe any
third party's intellectual property rights in performing or using
the Work, and that Canada will have no obligation to pay royalties
of any kind to anyone in connection with the Work.</li>
<li value="2">If anyone makes a claim against Canada or the

defend Canada against the claim. In either case, the Contractor
agrees to participate fully in the defence and any settlement
negotiations and to pay all costs, damages and legal costs incurred
or payable as a result of the claim, including the amount of any
settlement. Both Parties agree not to settle any claim unless the
other Party first approves the settlement in writing.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor has no obligation regarding claims
that were only made because:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Canada modified the Work or part of the Work without
the Contractor's consent or used the Work or part of the Work
without following a requirement of the Contract; or</li>
<li value="2">Canada used the Work or part of the Work with a
product that the Contractor did not supply under the Contract
(unless that use is described in the Contract or the manufacturer's

<li value="3">the Contractor used equipment, drawings,
specifications or other information supplied to the Contractor by
Canada (or by someone authorized by Canada); or</li>
<li value="4">the Contractor used a specific item of equipment or

Contracting Authority; however, this exception only applies if the
Contractor has included the following language in its own contract
with the supplier of that equipment or software: "<var>[Supplier name]</var>
acknowledges that the purchased items will be used by the
Government of Canada. If a third party claims that equipment or
software supplied under this contract infringes any intellectual
property right, <var>[supplier name]</var>, if requested to do so by either
<var>[Contractor name]</var> or Canada, will defend both <var>[Contractor name]</var> and
Canada against that claim at its own expense and will pay all

infringement." Obtaining this protection from the supplier is the
Contractor's responsibility and, if the Contractor does not do so,
it will be responsible to Canada for the claim.</li>

<li value="4">If anyone claims that, as a result of the Work, the
Contractor or Canada is infringing its intellectual property
rights, the Contractor must immediately do one of the following:

<li value="1">take whatever steps are necessary to allow Canada to
continue to use the allegedly infringing part of the Work; or</li>
<li value="2">modify or replace the Work to avoid intellectual
property infringement, while ensuring that the Work continues to
meet all the requirements of the Contract; or</li>
<li value="3">take back the Work and refund any part of the
Contract Price that Canada has already paid.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Contractor determines that none of these alternatives can
reasonably be achieved, or if the Contractor fails to take any of
these steps within a reasonable amount of time, Canada may choose
either to require the Contractor to do (c), or to take whatever
steps are necessary to acquire the rights to use the allegedly
infringing part(s) of the Work itself, in which case the Contractor
must reimburse Canada for all the costs it incurs to do so.</p>

rights of the Parties if it is made in writing by, in the case of a
waiver by Canada, the Contracting Authority and, in the case of a
waiver by the Contractor, the authorized representative of the
Contractor.</li>
<li value="4">The waiver by a Party of a breach of any condition of
the Contract will not be treated or interpreted as a waiver of any
subsequent breach and therefore will not prevent that Party from
enforcing of that term or condition in the case of a subsequent
breach.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment">2040 38 (2010-08-16) Assignment</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must not assign the Contract without

Any assignment made without that consent is void and will have no
effect. The assignment will be effective upon execution of an
assignment agreement signed by the Parties and the assignee.</li>
<li value="2">Assignment of the Contract does not relieve the

</ol>
<h2 id="suspension-of-the-work">2040 39 (2014-09-25) Suspension of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contracting Authority may at any time, by written
notice, order the Contractor to suspend or stop the Work or part of
the Work under the Contract for a period of up to 180 days. The Contractor must immediately comply with any
such order in a way that minimizes the cost of doing so. While such
an order is in effect, the Contractor must not remove any part of
the Work from any premises without first obtaining the written
consent of the Contracting Authority. Within these 180 days, the Contracting Authority must either cancel the
order or terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, under section
40 or section 41.</li>
<li value="2">When an order is made under subsection 1, unless the
Contracting Authority terminates the Contract by reason of default
by the Contractor or the Contractor abandons the Contract, the
Contractor will be entitled to be paid its additional costs
incurred as a result of the suspension plus a fair and reasonable
profit.</li>
<li value="3">When an order made under subsection 1 is cancelled,
the Contractor must resume work in accordance with the Contract as
soon as practicable. If the suspension has affected the
Contractor's ability to meet any delivery date under the Contract,
the date for performing the part of the Work affected by the
suspension will be extended for a period equal to the period of
suspension plus a period, if any, that in the opinion of the
Contracting Authority, following consultation with the Contractor,
is necessary for the Contractor to resume the Work. Any equitable
adjustments will be made as necessary to any affected conditions of
the Contract.</li>

default the Contract or part of the Contract. The termination will
take effect immediately or at the expiration of a cure period
specified in the notice, if the Contractor has not cured the
default to the satisfaction of the Contracting Authority within
that cure period.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent,
makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the
benefit of any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors,
or if a receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a
receiving order is made against the Contractor, or an order is made
or a resolution passed for the winding-up of the Contractor, the
Contracting Authority may, to the extent permitted by the laws of
Canada, by giving written notice to the Contractor, immediately
terminate for default the Contract or part of the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">If Canada gives notice under subsection 1 or 2, the
Contractor will have no claim for further payment except as
provided in this section. The Contractor will be liable to Canada
for all losses and damages suffered by Canada because of the
default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including
any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work
from another source. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to
Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at
the date of the termination.</li>
<li value="4">Upon termination of the Contract under this section,
the Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to
Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting
Authority, any completed parts of the Work, not delivered and
accepted before the termination and anything the Contractor has
acquired or produced specifically to perform the Contract. In such
a case, subject to the deduction of any claim that Canada may have
against the Contractor arising under the Contract or out of the
termination, Canada will pay or credit to the Contractor:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the value, of all completed parts of the Work
delivered to and accepted by Canada, based on the Contract Price,
including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee
included in the Contract Price; and</li>

reasonable in respect of anything else delivered to and accepted by
Canada.</li>

</li>
<li value="5">Title to everything for which payment is made to the
Contractor will, once payment is made, pass to Canada unless it
already belongs to Canada under any other provision of the
Contract.</li>
<li value="6">If the Contract is terminated for default under
subsection 1, but it is later determined that grounds did not exist
for a termination for default, the notice will be considered a
notice of termination for convenience issued under subsection 1 of
section 41.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="termination-for-convenience">2040 41 (2012-07-16) Termination for Convenience</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">At any time before the completion of the Work, the
Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the
Contractor, terminate for convenience the Contract or part of the
Contract. Once such a notice of termination for convenience is
given, the Contractor must comply with the requirements of the
termination notice. If the Contract is terminated in part only, the
Contractor must proceed to complete any part of the Work that is
not affected by the termination notice. The termination will take
effect immediately or, as the case may be, at the time specified in
the termination notice.</li>
<li value="2">If a termination notice is given pursuant to
subsection 1, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid, for costs
that have been reasonably and properly incurred to perform the
Contract to the extent that the Contractor has not already been
paid or reimbursed by Canada. The Contractor will be paid:

<li value="3">Canada may reduce the payment in respect of any part
of the Work, if upon inspection, it does not meet the requirements
of the Contract.</li>
<li value="4">The total of the amounts, to which the Contractor is
entitled to be paid under this section, together with any amounts
paid, due or becoming due to the Contractor must not exceed the
Contract Price. The Contractor will have no claim for damages,
compensation, loss of profit, allowance arising out of any
termination notice given by Canada under this section except to the
extent that this section expressly provides. The Contractor agrees
to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment
that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</li>

payment under the Contract, or until the settlement of all
outstanding claims and disputes, whichever is later. During this
time, the Contractor must make this information available for
audit, inspection and examination by the representatives of Canada,
who may make copies and take extracts. The Contractor must provide
all reasonably required facilities for any audit and inspection and
must furnish all the information as the representatives of Canada
may from time to time require to perform a complete audit of the

accordance with the Basis of Payment provision in the Articles of
Agreement, is subject to government audit both before and after

Canada. Canada may hold back, deduct and set off any credits owing
