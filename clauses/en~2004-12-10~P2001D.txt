<pre>1.     The term of the Contract shall be for the period commencing from 
       date of contract booking and ending on the last day of ___________ (<strong>
       Insert month and year)</strong>; with Canada having an option to negotiate _____ 
       consecutive contract(s) de Novo for a one-year period (each), under 
       the same general terms and conditions as the Contract, subject only 
       to an increase or decrease in the cost of material and/or labour at 
       such time.

2.     The Contracting Authority shall notify the Contractor of its 
       intention to negotiate for a further one-year period, at least 
       ninety (90) days prior to the expiry of the then current term, 
       whereupon the Contractor shall forthwith supply the Contracting 
       Authority with all necessary evidence for the purpose of 
       establishing such labour and material costs.  In the event that the 
       price resulting from the negotiation is satisfactory to Canada, then 
       a contract de Novo will be implemented immediately on the expiry of 
       the then current term, but if unsatisfactory to Canada the said 
       current Contract will be deemed to have been fully discharged and 
       ended at the expiry of the then current term.
