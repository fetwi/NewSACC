<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>This procurement is conditionally limited to Canadian goods.

Subject to the evaluation procedures contained in the bid solicitation, 
bidders acknowledge that only bids with a certification that the good(s) 
offered are Canadian goods, as defined in clause A3050T, may be considered.

Failure to provide this certification completed with the bid will result in 
the good(s) offered being treated as non-Canadian goods.

The Bidder certifies that:

              (     )       a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price 
              consist of Canadian goods as defined in paragraph 1 of clause 
              A3050T.

Annex 7.8 of the <em>Supply Manual</em> (http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/acquisitions/text/sm
/chapter07-e.html#annex 7.8) shows how Canadian content is determined for a 
mix of goods, a mix of services or a mix of goods and services.
