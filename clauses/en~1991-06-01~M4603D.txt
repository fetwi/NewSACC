<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1. Rates quoted are to be ceiling hourly rates for the period of the 
standing offer, subject to downward adjustment only at the time of 
negotiation of amendments to increase the financial limitation of the 
standing offer.

2. The following 16 items (henceforward referred to as group I) will be 
subject to a mandatory rate assessment.

3. A "total composite weighted mean Group I hourly rate" will be 
established.  It shall be calculated as follows:

       3.1 Calculate the mean weighted rate for each item (1-16 inclusive).

       3.2 The total hours purchased by the federal government in the 
       National Capital Region for the period _____ - _____  for each item 
       will be used for weighting.

       3.3 Once the mean weighted rates for each item are determined, their 
       aggregate will be the "total composite weighted mean Group I hourly 
       rate".

4. The company submitted rate for each item (1-16 inclusive) weighted as 
per subparagraph 3.2 will be established.  A supplier's aggregate weighted 
hourly rate for Group I will be calculated.

5. In the event that a supplier's weighted composite Group I hourly rate 
exceeds the "total composite weighted mean Group I hourly rate" by 5 
percent or more, the supplier may receive a standing offer based on the 
ceiling hourly rates quoted but with an estimated limitation of expenditure 
representing 50 percent of their previous year business volume plus the 
normal allowance for volume and pricing increases.  Subsequent amendments 
would be negotiated based on the approach described under the clause 
entitled Financial Limitations.

       N.B. For suppliers who failed to bid on all 16 items, the rate 
       assessment would be based on an adjusted total composite weighted 
       mean Group I hourly rate. 

6. The remaining categories (other than Group I) will not be subject to a 
   mandatory rate assessment at the time of evaluation of the proposals 
   received.  However, in the event that amendments to standing offers are 
   requested, negotiations would be entered into for all categories.
