<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>A supply arrangement is a method of supply used by Public Works
and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to procure goods and
services. A supply arrangement is an arrangement between Canada and
pre-qualified suppliers that allows identified users to solicit
bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific
requirements within the scope of a supply arrangement. A supply
arrangement is not a contract for the provision of the goods and
services described in it and neither party is legally bound as a
result of signing a supply arrangement alone. The intent of a
supply arrangement is to establish a framework to permit
expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations which result
in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described
in those bid solicitations.</p>
<p>Except for those procurements where public advertising is not
required or used, Requests for Supply Arrangements (RFSAs) are
posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) and
suppliers who are interested in responding to individual bid
solicitations issued under a supply arrangement framework are
invited to submit an arrangement to become pre-qualified suppliers.
The list of pre-qualified suppliers will be used as a source list
for procurement within the scope of the supply arrangement and only
suppliers who are pre-qualified at the time individual bid
solicitations are issued will be eligible to bid. Supply
arrangements include a set of predetermined conditions that will
apply to subsequent bid solicitations and contracts. Supply
arrangements may include ceiling prices which may be lowered based
on an actual requirement or scope of work described in a bid
solicitation.</p>
<h2>01 (2013-03-21) Code of Conduct and Certifications - Arrangement </h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Suppliers must comply with the Code of Conduct for Procurement. In addition to the Code of Conduct for Procurement, suppliers must a) respond to Requests for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, b) accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>, Supply Arrangement (SA) and any resulting contracts, c) submit arrangements and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.</li>
<li>Suppliers further understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be issued an SA or awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any arrangement in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada. If it is determined, after issuance of a <abbr title="Standing Offer">SA</abbr>, that the Supplier made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to cancel the <abbr title="Standing Offer">SA</abbr> and to terminate for default any resulting contracts. The Supplier will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested. The Supplier and any of the Supplier's affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any supply arrangement arising from this <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and any resulting contracts. </li>
<li>
For the purpose of this section, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Supplier's affiliates if: 
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li>a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in this section which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Suppliers who are incorporated, including those submitting an arrangement as a joint venture, must provide with their arrangement or promptly thereafter a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Supplier.  Suppliers submitting an arrangement as sole proprietorship, including those submitting an arrangement as a joint venture, must provide with their arrangement or promptly thereafter the name of the owner.  Suppliers submitting an arrangement as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.  If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of arrangements is completed, Canada will inform the Supplier of a time frame within which to provide the information.  Failure to comply will render the arrangement non-responsive.  Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for a Supply Arrangement to be issued.
</p>
<p>
Canada may, at any time, request that a Supplier provide properly completed and Signed Consent Forms (Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229) for any or all individuals aforementioned within the time specified.  Failure to provide such Consent Forms within the time period provided will result in the arrangement being declared non-responsive.
</p>
</li>
<li>The Supplier must diligently maintain an up-to-date list of names by informing Canada in writing of any change occurring during the validity period of the arrangement as well as during the period of any Supply Arrangement arising from this <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and any resulting contracts. The Supplier must also, when so requested, provide Canada with the corresponding Consent Forms.</li>
<li>By submitting an arrangement, the Supplier certifies that it is aware, and that its affiliates are aware, that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility.  Canada may also verify the information provided by the Supplier, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li>By submitting an arrangement, the Supplier certifies that neither the Supplier nor any of the Supplier's affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Supply Arrangement arising from this <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and any resulting contracts if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the  Lobbying Act.</li>
<li>
By submitting an arrangement, the Supplier certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a) or b) are to receive any benefit under a Supply Arrangement arising from this <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and any resulting contracts arising from this <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>.  In addition, the Supplier certifies that except for those offences where a criminal pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, neither the Supplier nor any of the Supplier's affiliates has ever been convicted of an offence under any of the following provisions: 
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>), subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the Financial Administration Act, or</li>
<li>section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor subscribing to election fund</em>), section 124 (<em>Selling or Purchasing Office</em>), section 380 (<em>Fraud</em>) for fraud committed against Her Majesty or section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> of Canada, or</li>
<li>section 462.31 (<em>Laundering proceeds of crime</em>) or sections 467.11 to 467.13 (<em>Participation in activities of criminal organization</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> of Canada, or</li>
<li>section 45 (<em>Conspiracies, agreements or arrangements between competitors</em>), 46 (<em>Foreign directives</em>) 47 (<em>Bid rigging</em>), 49 (<em>Agreements or arrangements of federal financial institutions</em>), 52 (<em>False or misleading representation</em>), 53 (<em>Deceptive notice of winning a prize</em>) under the Competition Act, or</li>
<li>section 239 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li>section 327 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Excise Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li>section 3 (<em>Bribing a foreign public official</em>) of the <cite>Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act</cite>, or</li>
<li>section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</cite>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In circumstances where a criminal pardon or a record suspension has been obtained, or capacities have been restored by the Governor in Council, the Supplier must provide with its arrangement or promptly thereafter a copy of confirming documentation from an official source.  If such documentation has not been received by the time the evaluation of arrangements is completed, Canada will inform the Supplier of a time frame within which to provide the information.  Failure to comply will render the arrangement non-responsive.</li>
<li>
Suppliers understand that Canada may contract outside of the present solicitation process with a supplier who has been convicted of an offense enumerated under c) to h) of the paragraph hereinabove, or who is affiliated with someone who has been convicted of an offense enumerated under c) to h) of the paragraph hereinabove, when required to do so by law or legal proceedings, or when Canada considers it necessary to the public interest for reasons which include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Only one person is capable of performing the contract;</li>
<li>Emergency;</li>
<li>National security;</li>
<li>Health and safety;</li>
<li>Economic harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canada reserves the right to impose additional conditions or measures to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>02 (2012-03-02) Procurement Business Number</h2>
<p>Suppliers are required to have a Procurement Business
Number (PBN) before issuance of a supply arrangement. Suppliers may
register for a <abbr title="Procurement Business Number">PBN</abbr> on line at Supplier Registration
Information. For non-Internet registration, suppliers may
contact the InfoLine at 1-800-811-1148 to obtain the telephone
number of the nearest Supplier Registration Agent.</p>
<h2>03 (2008-05-12) Standard Instructions, Clauses and Conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public
Works and Government Services Act</cite> (<abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 16),
the instructions, clauses and conditions identified in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and
resulting supply arrangement by number, date and title are
incorporated by reference into and form part of the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and
resulting supply arrangement as though expressly set out in the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and resulting supply arrangement.</p>
<h2>04 (2008-12-12) Definition of Supplier</h2>
<p><dfn>"Supplier"</dfn> means the person or entity (or, in the case
of a joint venture, the persons or entities) submitting an
arrangement. It does not include the parent, subsidiaries or other
affiliates of the Supplier, or its subcontractors.</p>
<h2>05 (2012-03-02) Submission of Arrangements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada requires that each arrangement, at closing
date and time or upon request from the Supply Arrangement
Authority, be signed by the Supplier or by an authorized
representative of the Supplier. If an arrangement is submitted by a
joint venture, it must be in accordance with section 16.</li>
<li value="2">It is the Supplier's responsibility to:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">obtain clarification of the requirements contained in
the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>, if necessary, before submitting an arrangement;</li>
<li value="2">prepare the arrangement in accordance with the
instructions contained in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>;</li>
<li value="3">submit by closing date and time a complete
arrangement;</li>
<li value="4">send the arrangement only to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Bid Receiving Unit
specified on page 1 of the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> or to the address specified in the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>. The facsimile number and related instructions for
arrangements transmitted by facsimile are provided in section
08;</li>
<li value="5">ensure that the Supplier's name, return address, <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>
number, and <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> closing date and time are clearly visible on the
envelope or the parcel(s) containing the arrangement; and,</li>
<li value="6">provide a comprehensible and sufficiently detailed
arrangement, including all requested pricing details, that will
permit a complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set
out in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">If Canada has provided suppliers with multiple
formats of a document (for example, a document may be downloaded
through the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) but may
also be made available on <abbr title="Compact Disc Read-only Memory">CD-ROM</abbr> through <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>), the format
downloaded through <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr> will take precedence. If Canada posts an
amendment to the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> revising any documents provided to suppliers
in multiple formats, Canada will not necessarily update all formats
to reflect these revisions. It is the Supplier's responsibility to
ensure that revisions made through any <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> amendment issued
through <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr> are taken into account in the alternate formats it
uses of <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> documents.</li>
<li value="4">Arrangements will remain open for acceptance for a
period of not less than sixty (60) days from the closing date of
the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>, unless specified otherwise in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>. Canada reserves
the right to seek an extension of the arrangement validity period
from all responsive suppliers in writing, within a minimum of three
(3) days before the end of the arrangement validity period. If the
extension is accepted by all responsive suppliers, Canada will
continue with the evaluation of the arrangements. If the extension
is not accepted by all responsive suppliers, Canada will, at its
sole discretion, either continue with the evaluation of the
arrangements of those who have accepted the extension or cancel the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>.</li>
<li value="5">Arrangements and supporting information may be
submitted in either English or French.</li>
<li value="6">Arrangements received on or before the stipulated
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> closing date and time will become the property of Canada and
will not be returned. All arrangements will be treated as
confidential, subject to the provisions of the <cite>
Access to Information Act</cite> (<abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> A-1), and the
<em><cite>
Privacy Act</cite></em> (<abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> P-21).</li>
<li value="7">Unless specified otherwise in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>, Canada will
evaluate only the documentation provided with the arrangement.
Canada will not evaluate information such as references to Web site
addresses where additional information can be found, or technical
manuals or brochures not submitted with the arrangement.</li>
<li value="8">An arrangement cannot be assigned or transferred in
whole or in part.</li>
</ol>
<h2>06 (2008-05-12) Late Arrangements</h2>
<p><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> will return arrangements delivered after the stipulated
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> closing date and time, unless they qualify as a delayed
arrangement as described below.</p>
<h2>07 (2012-03-02) Delayed Arrangements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">An arrangement delivered to the specified bid
receiving unit after the closing date and time but before the
supply arrangement issuance date may be considered, provided the
supplier can prove the delay is due solely to a delay in delivery
that can be attributed to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or
national equivalent of a foreign country). Purolator <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> is not
considered to be part of <abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> for the purposes of delayed
arrangements. The only pieces of evidence relating to a delay in
the <abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> system that are acceptable to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> are:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1"><abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> cancellation date stamp; or</li>
<li value="2"><abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> Priority Courier bill of lading; or</li>
<li value="3"><abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> Xpresspost label</li>
</ol>
<p>that clearly indicates that the arrangement was mailed before
the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> closing date.</p></li>
<li value="2">Misrouting, traffic volume, weather disturbances,
labour disputes or any other causes for the late delivery of
arrangements are not acceptable reasons for the arrangement to be
accepted by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.</li>
<li value="3">Postage meter imprints, whether imprinted by the
Supplier, the <abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> or the postal authority outside Canada, are not
acceptable as proof of timely mailing.</li>
</ol>
<h2>08 (2012-03-02) Transmission by Facsimile</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Unless specified otherwise in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>, arrangements
may be submitted by facsimile. The only acceptable facsimile number
for responses to <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>s issued by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> headquarters is
819-997-9776. The facsimile number for responses to <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>s issued by
<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> regional offices is identified in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>.</li>
<li value="2">For arrangements transmitted by facsimile, Canada
will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the
transmission or receipt of the faxed arrangement including, but not
limited to, the following:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">receipt of garbled or incomplete arrangement;</li>
<li value="2">availability or condition of the receiving facsimile
equipment;</li>
<li value="3">incompatibility between the sending and receiving
equipment;</li>
<li value="4">delay in transmission or receipt of the
arrangement;</li>
<li value="5">failure of the Supplier to properly identify the
arrangement;</li>
<li value="6">illegibility of the arrangement; or</li>
<li value="7">security of arrangement data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">An arrangement transmitted by facsimile will
constitute the formal arrangement of the Supplier and must be
submitted in accordance with section 05.</li>
</ol>
<h2>09 (2010-10-07) Customs Clearance</h2>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Supplier to allow sufficient
time to obtain customs clearance, where required, before the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>
closing date and time. Delays related to the obtaining of customs
clearance cannot be construed as "undue delay in the mail" and will
not be accepted as a delayed arrangement under section 07.</p>
<h2>10 (2008-05-12) Legal Capacity</h2>
<p>The Supplier must have the legal capacity to contract. If the
Supplier is a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate
body, the Supplier must provide, if requested by the Supply
Arrangement Authority, a statement and any requested supporting
documentation indicating the laws under which it is registered or
incorporated together with the registered or corporate name and
place of business. This also applies to suppliers submitting an
arrangement as a joint venture.</p>
<h2>11 (2008-12-12) Rights of Canada</h2>
<p>Canada reserves the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">reject any or all arrangements received in response
to the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>;</li>
<li value="2">cancel the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> at any time;</li>
<li value="3">reissue the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>;</li>
<li value="4">if no responsive arrangements are received and the
requirement is not substantially modified, reissue the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> by
inviting only the suppliers who submitted an arrangement to
resubmit arrangements within a period designated by Canada;
and</li>
<li value="5">issue <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>s and supply arrangements to suppliers who
qualify throughout the entire period of the supply
arrangement.</li>
</ol>
<h2>12 (2012-03-02) Rejection of Arrangement</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may reject an arrangement where any of the
following circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Supplier is subject to a Vendor Performance
Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which
renders the Supplier ineligible to submit an arrangement for the
requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the
arrangement, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure,
under the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which would render that
employee or subcontractor ineligible to submit an arrangement for
the requirement, or the portion of the requirement the employee or
subcontractor is to perform;</li>
<li value="3">the Supplier is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li value="4">evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has been received with respect to the Supplier, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of the arrangement;</li>
<li value="5">evidence satisfactory to Canada that based on past conduct or behavior, the Supplier, a subcontractor or a person who is to perform the Work is unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly;</li>
<li value="6">with respect to current or previous transactions with
the Government of Canada:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of
suspension or termination for default with respect to a contract
with the Supplier, any of its employees or any subcontractor
included as part of the arrangement;</li>
<li value="2">Canada determines that the Supplier's performance on other
contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as well as the
extent to which the Supplier performed the Work in accordance with
contractual clauses and conditions, is sufficiently poor to
jeopardize the successful completion of any requirement to be bid
on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject an arrangement
pursuant to a provision of subsection 1. (f), the Supply
Arrangement Authority will so inform the Supplier and provide the
Supplier ten (10) days within which to make representations, before
making a final decision on the arrangement rejection.</li>
<li value="3">Canada reserves the right to apply additional scrutiny, in particular, when multiple arrangements are received in response to a request for supply arrangements from a single supplier or a joint venture. Canada reserves the right to:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">reject any or all of the arrangements submitted by a single supplier or joint venture if their inclusion in the evaluation has the effect of prejudicing the integrity and fairness of the process, or; </li>
<li value="2">reject any or all of the arrangements submitted by a single supplier or joint venture if their inclusion in the procurement process would distort the solicitation evaluation, and would cause a result that would not reasonably have been expected under prevailing market conditions and/or would not provide good value to Canada.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>13 (2008-12-12) Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> process,
enquiries and other communications regarding the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> must be
directed only to the Supply Arrangement Authority identified in the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the
arrangement being declared non-responsive.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to
suppliers, significant enquiries received and the replies to such
enquiries will be provided simultaneously to suppliers to which the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> has been sent, without revealing the sources of the
enquiries.</p>
<h2>14 (2008-05-12) Arrangement Costs</h2>
<p>No payment will be made for costs incurred in the preparation
and submission of an arrangement in response to the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>. Costs
associated with preparing and submitting an arrangement as well as
any costs incurred by the Supplier associated with the evaluation
of the arrangement, are the sole responsibility of the
Supplier.</p>
<h2>15 (2008-12-12) Conduct of Evaluation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In conducting its evaluation of the arrangements,
Canada may, but will have no obligation to, do the following:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">seek clarification or verification from suppliers
regarding any or all information provided by them with respect to
the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>;</li>
<li value="2">contact any or all references supplied by suppliers
to verify and validate any information submitted by them;</li>
<li value="3">request, before issuance of any supply arrangement,
specific information with respect to suppliers' legal status;</li>

examine their technical, managerial, and financial capabilities to
determine if they are adequate to meet the requirements of the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>;</li>
<li value="5">verify any information provided by suppliers through
independent research, use of any government resources or by
contacting third parties;</li>
<li value="6">interview, at the sole costs of suppliers, any
supplier and/or any or all of the resources proposed by suppliers
to fulfill the requirement of the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Suppliers will have the number of days specified in
the request by the Supply Arrangement Authority to comply with any
request related to any of the above items. Failure to comply with
the request may result in the arrangement being declared
non-responsive.</li>
</ol>
<h2>16 (2012-03-02) Joint Venture</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A joint venture is an association of two or more
parties who combine their money, property, knowledge, expertise or
other resources in a single joint business enterprise, sometimes
referred as a consortium, to submit an arrangement together on a
requirement. Suppliers who submit an arrangement as a joint venture
must indicate clearly that it is a joint venture and provide the
following information:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the name of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li value="2">the Procurement Business Number of each member of the
joint venture;</li>
<li value="3">the name of the representative of the joint venture,
i.e. the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf,
if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the information is not clearly provided in the
arrangement, the Supplier must provide the information on request
from the Supply Arrangement Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The arrangement must be signed by all the members of
the joint venture unless one member has been appointed to act on
behalf of all members of the joint venture. The Supply Arrangement
Authority may, at any time, require each member of the joint
venture to confirm that the representative has been appointed with
full authority to act as its representative for the purposes of the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and any resulting supply arrangement.</li>
</ol>
<h2>17 (2012-03-02) Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, suppliers are advised that Canada may reject an
arrangement in the following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Supplier, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> or in any situation of
conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Supplier, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> that was not available to other
suppliers and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to
give the Supplier an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a supplier who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This supplier remains however subject to
the criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject an arrangement under
this section, the Supply Arrangement Authority will inform the
Supplier and provide the Supplier an opportunity to make
representations before making a final decision. Suppliers who are
in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Supply
