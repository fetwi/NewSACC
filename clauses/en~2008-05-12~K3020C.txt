<p>If commercial exploitation or further development of the
Foreground Information reasonably requires the use of certain
Canada-owned information other than that supplied to the Contractor
for purposes of the Contract, Canada may provide the Contractor
with a license for that purpose, on conditions to be negotiated
between the Contractor and the client department or agency for whom
the Work is being performed. Those conditions may include the
payment of compensation. The Contractor must give the client
department or agency an explanation as to why such a license is
required. The client department or agency must respond in writing
to the request within a reasonable period of time.</p>
