<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     In the event the Contractor delivers non-conforming work, and this 
       non-conformity is due to pages, covers, booklets, and/or documents 
       of one regional, provincial, or inter-provincial requirement being 
       mixed with pages, covers, booklets, and/or documents of another 
       regional, provincial, or interprovincial requirement, or if this 
       intermixing takes place within the book itself, then the Contracting 
       Authority may, by notice under this clause, inform the Contractor of 
       such mixing and place the Contractor in default under the terms of 
       this clause.

2.     A Contractor who has been placed in default under the terms of this 
       clause is precluded and ineligible, for a period of two (2) calendar 
       years after the award date of the Contract under which the default 
       took place, to be awarded more than one contract per portion of the 
       printing requirements, of the Tax Program for Revenue Canada, 
       Taxation, whereby the possibility for intermixing could reoccur.

3.     During this two-year period, in the event the Contractor submits 
       more than one low bid in any given portion of the above-described 
       requirements, Canada reserves the right to accept only one of those 
       bids, and the Contractor would be offered the choice to choose which 
       one.
