<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Canada may reject a bid where any of the following circumstances is 
       present:

       (a)    the bidder, or any employee or subcontractor included as part 
              of the bid, has been convicted under section 121 ("Frauds on 
              the government" &amp; "Contractor subscribing to election fund"), 
              124 ("Selling or purchasing office"), or 418 ("Selling 
              defective stores to Her Majesty") of the <em>Criminal Code</em>; or

       (b)    the bidder is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective 
              Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which renders 
              the bidder ineligible to bid on the Work;

       (c)    an employee or subcontractor included as part of the bid, is 
              subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under the 
              Vendor Performance Policy, which would render that employee 
              or subcontractor ineligible to bid on the Work, or the 
              portion of the Work the employee or subcontractor is to 
              perform;

       (d)    with respect to current or prior transactions with the 
              Government of Canada 

              (1)    the bidder is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, 
                     its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended 
                     period;

              (2)    evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, 
                     fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with 
                     any law protecting individuals against any manner of 
                     discrimination, has been received with respect to the 
                     bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor 
                     included as part of its bid;

              (3)    Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of 
                     suspension or termination for default with respect to 
                     a Contract with the bidder, any of its employees or 
                     any subcontractor included as part of its bid; or

              (4)    Canada determines that the bidder's performance on 
                     other contracts, including the efficiency and 
                     workmanship as well as the extent to which the bidder 
                     executed the work in accordance with contractual terms 
                     and conditions, is sufficiently poor to jeopardize the 
                     successful completion of the requirement being bid on.


2.     Where Canada intends to reject a bid pursuant to a provision of 
       paragraph 1, other than 1(b), the Contracting Authority will so 
       inform the bidder and provide the bidder ten (10) days within which 
       to make representations, prior to making a final decision on the bid 
       rejection.
