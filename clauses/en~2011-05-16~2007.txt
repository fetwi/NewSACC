<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by PWGSC to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated
expenditure specified in a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) are
only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A RFSO
does not commit PWGSC to authorize the utilization of a standing
offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A
standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by PWGSC of a
Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to
departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not
constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods,
services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or
several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2>01 Code of Conduct for Procurement</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">To comply with the Code of <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">
Conduct for Procurement</a>, offerors must respond to Requests for
Standing Offers (RFSOs) in an honest, fair and comprehensive
manner, accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the
requirements stipulated in the RFSO and resulting contract, submit
offers and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all
obligations of the Contract. To ensure fairness, openness and
transparency in the bidding process, the following activities are
prohibited:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">payment of a contingency fee by any party to a
contract to a person to whom the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/L-12.4/20100209/page-1.html?rp2=HOME&amp;rp3=SI&amp;rp4=all&amp;rp5=Loi%20sur%20le%20lobbying&amp;rp9=cs&amp;rp10=L&amp;rp13=50&amp;noCookie" rel="external">
Lobbying Act</a></cite> (1985, c. 44 (4th Supp.)) applies;</li>
<li value="2">corruption, collusion, bid-rigging or any other
anti-competitive activity in the bidding process for contracts for
the provision of goods or services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that
neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates has ever
been convicted of a criminal offence in respect of the activities
stated in (a) or (b) above or is the subject of outstanding
criminal charges in respect of such activities filed subsequent to
September 1, 2010.</li>
<li value="3">Offerors further understand that the commission of
certain offences will render them ineligible to be issued a
contract. By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that
neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates has ever
been convicted or is the subject of outstanding criminal charges in
respect of an offence under any of the following provisions:
<p>Section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor
subscribing to election fund</em>), Section 124 (<em>Selling or
Purchasing Office</em>), Section 380 (<em>Fraud committed against
Her Majesty</em>) or Section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to
Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code of Canada</cite>, or under
paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>)
subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or Section
154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial
Administration Act</cite>.</p></li>
<li value="4">For the purpose of this section, business concerns,
organizations or individuals are Offeror's Affiliates if, directly
or indirectly, 1) either one controls or has the power to control
the other, or 2) a third party has the power to control both.
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking
management or ownership, identity of interests among family
members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees,
or a business entity created following the charges or convictions
contemplated in this section which has the same or similar
management, ownership, or principal employees as the Offeror that
is charged or convicted, as the case may be.</li>
<li value="5">Except in the limited circumstances set out in
subsection 6 below, the Standing Offer Authority will declare
non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information
contained in the certifications contemplated above is determined to
be untrue in any respect by the Standing Offer
Authority.</li>
<li value="6">Subsection 5 has no application in the circumstances
where an offeror has pled guilty of an offence contemplated in
Section 01, 1. (b) and the Offeror has provided with its offer an
assurance from the Competition Bureau of Canada indicating that the
Offeror has been granted leniency, or in the circumstances where
the Offeror provides documentation from the National Parole Board
that the Offeror has obtained a criminal pardon in relation to such
offence.</li>
<li value="7">The Offeror acknowledges and agrees that the
certifications contemplated must remain valid during the period of
any resulting standing offer arising from this RFSO and any call-up
made under the Standing Offer.</li>
</ol>
<h2>02 Procurement Business Number</h2>
<p>Canadian suppliers are required to have a Procurement Business
Number (PBN) before issuance of a standing offer. Suppliers may
register for a PBN on line at <a href="https://srisupplier.contractscanada.gc.ca/" rel="external">Supplier Registration
Information</a>. For non-Internet registration, suppliers may
contact the InfoLine at 1-800-811-1148 to obtain the telephone
number of the nearest Supplier Registration Agent.</p>
<h2>03 Standard Instructions, Clauses and Conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/P-38.2/" rel="external">Department of Public
Works and Government Services Act</a></cite> (S.C. 1996, c. 16),
the instructions, clauses and conditions identified in the RFSO,
standing offer and resulting contract(s) by number, date and title
are incorporated by reference into and form part of the RFSO,
standing offer and resulting contract(s) as though expressly set
out in the RFSO, the standing offer and the resulting
contract(s).</p>
<h2>04 Definition of Offeror</h2>
<p><dfn>"Offeror"</dfn> means the person or entity (or, in the case
of a joint venture, the persons or entities) submitting a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both under a call-up resulting
from a standing offer. It does not include the parent, subsidiaries
or other affiliates of the Offeror, or its subcontractors.</p>
<h2>05 Submission of an Offer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada requires that each offer, at closing date and
time or upon request from the Standing Offer Authority, be signed
by the Offeror or by an authorized representative of the Offeror.
If an offer is submitted by a joint venture, it must be in
accordance with Section 10.</li>
<li value="2">2 The offer will be treated as confidential, subject to the
provisions of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/A-1/20100209/page-1.html?rp2=HOME&amp;rp3=SI&amp;rp4=all&amp;rp5=Access%20to%20Information%20Act&amp;rp9=cs&amp;rp10=L&amp;rp13=50&amp;noCookie" rel="external">
Access to Information Act</a></cite> (R.S., 1985, c. A-1), and the

Privacy Act</a></cite> (R.S., 1985, c. P-21).</li>
</ol>
<h2>06 Legal Capacity</h2>
<p>The Offeror must have the legal capacity to contract. If the
Offeror is a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate
body, the Offeror must provide, if requested by the Standing Offer
Authority, a statement and any requested supporting documentation
indicating the laws under which it is registered or incorporated
together with the registered or corporate name and place of
business. This also applies to offerors submitting an offer as a
joint venture.</p>
<h2>07 Rejection of Offer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may reject an offer where any of the following
circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Offeror is subject to a Vendor Performance
Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which
renders the Offeror ineligible to submit an offer for the
requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the
offer, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under
the Vendor Performance Policy, which would render that employee or
subcontractor ineligible to submit an offer for the requirement, or
the portion of the requirement the employee or subcontractor is to
perform;</li>
<li value="3">with respect to current or prior transactions with
the Government of Canada
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the Offeror is bankrupt or where, for whatever
reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended
period;</li>
<li value="2">evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery,
fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law
protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has
been received with respect to the Offeror, any of its employees or
any subcontractor included as part of the offer;</li>
<li value="3">Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of
suspension or termination for default with respect to a contract
with the Offeror, any of its employees or any subcontractor
included as part of the offer;</li>
<li value="4">Canada determines that the Offeror's performance on other
contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as well as the
extent to which the Offeror performed the Work in accordance with
contractual clauses and conditions, is sufficiently poor to
jeopardize the successful completion of the requirement being bid
on.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject an offer pursuant to a
provision of subsection 1. (c), the Standing Offer Authority will
so inform the Offeror and provide the Offeror ten (10) days within
which to make representations, before making a final decision on
the offer rejection.</li>
</ol>
<h2>08 Price Justification</h2>
<p>The Offeror must provide, on Canada's request, one or more of

<li value="5">any other supporting documentation as requested by
Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>09 Offer Costs</h2>
<p>No payment will be made for costs incurred in the preparation
and submission of an offer in response to the RFSO. Costs
associated with preparing and submitting an offer are the sole
responsibility of the Offeror.</p>
<h2>10 Joint Venture</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A joint venture is an association of two or more
parties who combine their money, property, knowledge, expertise or
other resources in a single joint business enterprise, sometimes
referred as a consortium, to submit an offer together on a
requirement. Offerors who submit an offer as a joint venture must
indicate clearly that it is a joint venture and provide the
following information:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the name of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li value="2">the Procurement Business Number of each member of the
joint venture;</li>
<li value="3">the name of the representative of the joint venture,
i.e. the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf,
if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the information is not clearly provided in the
offer, the Offeror must provide the information on request from the
Standing Offer Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The offer and any resulting standing offer must be
signed by all the members of the joint venture unless one member
has been appointed to act on behalf of all members of the joint
venture. The Standing Offer Authority may, at any time, require
each member of the joint venture to confirm that the representative
has been appointed with full authority to act as its representative
for the purposes of the RFSO and any resulting standing offer. If a
standing offer is issued to a joint venture, all members of the
joint venture will be jointly and severally or solidarily liable
for the performance of any contract resulting from a call-up
against the standing offer.</li>
</ol>

Offer Authority identified in the RFSO.</p>
