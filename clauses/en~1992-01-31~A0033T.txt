<pre>Evaluation using point rating - Contractor selection on the basis of 
highest rated technical proposal.

BASIS OF SELECTION:

Further to DSS-MAS 9403-5 "Standard Instructions and Conditions", it is 
understood by the parties submitting proposals that, to be considered valid, 
a proposal must achieve a minimum of 70% of the  points for the criteria 
used in the point rating. The rating is performed on a scale of 100 points.

Proposals not meeting this minimum requirement will be given no further 
consideration. The valid proposal that scores the highest number of rating 
points will be recommended for the award of a contract, provided that the 
estimated total price does not exceed the funds available for this 
requirement.
