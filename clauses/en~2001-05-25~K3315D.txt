<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause where Canada will own the Foreground Information 
pursuant to DSS-MAS 9601-7 or K3410D, where K3305D or K3306D will be used and 
where the client department is, at the time of the Contract, prepared to grant 
the Contractor access to Canada-owned information for purposes of Contractor's 
further development or commercial exploitation of the Foreground Information, 
where such development and commercial exploitation is permitted under license 
from Canada.  Such a license to Canada-owned information would be negotiated 
separately between Canada and the contractor, for purposes of the commercial 
exploitation of the Foreground Information.

If appropriate, replace "certain Canada-owned information" by a list of specific 
items the Crown may be willing to licence to the Contractor.

for purposes of the commercial exploitation or further development of the 
Foreground Information, and where Canada has granted or grants a license to 
the Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground Information for such 
purposes, then the Contractor may make a written request for a license to 
exercise the required Intellectual Property Rights in such Canada-owned 
information,<strong> </strong>to the minister for whose department or agency the Work is 
being or was carried out.  The Contractor shall give that minister an 
explanation as to why such a license is required.  That minister shall 
respond in writing to any request for such a license within a reasonable 
period of time.  Should the minister for whose department the work is being 
or was carried out agree to grant such a license, it shall be on terms and 
conditions to be negotiated between the Contractor and that minister.  It 
is understood that those terms may include payment of compensation to 
Canada.
