       (b) Unless otherwise provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall 
       obtain the consent of the Minister in writing prior to the 
       subcontracting of any portion of the Work.  Any consent to a

       under the Contract or be construed as authorizing the establishment 
       of any liability whatsoever on the part of Canada or the Minister to 
       a subcontractor.

       subparagraph (d)(i), the Contractor agrees to bind the subcontractor 
       by terms and conditions similar to and, in the opinion of the 
       Minister, not less favourable to Canada than the Contract, to the 
       extent they are applicable to the Work subcontracted, unless the 
       Minister otherwise consents.       

       (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the Contractor may, without prior 
       consent of the Minister:       

              (i)   purchase "off the shelf" items and such standard 
              articles and materials as are ordinarily manufactured or 
              produced by mills and manufacturers in the normal course of 
              business;

              (ii)  subcontract for the provision of services as are 
              ordinarily performed by suppliers of such services in their 
              normal course of business;

              (iii) subcontract any of the Work, to any one subcontractor, 
              up to a value in the aggregate of:            

              -    50 percent for contracts valued up to $100,000, or 
              -    10 percent of the value of the contract, to a maximum of $100,000 
              for contracts valued in excess of $100,000

       (b) The Contractor undertakes to perform the Work in a conscientious, 
       diligent and efficient manner and to provide a quality of service at 
       least equal to that which contractors generally would expect of a

       (c) Unless the Minister orders a suspension of the Work or part 
       thereof pursuant to the section of the General Conditions entitled "
       Suspension of the Work", the Contractor shall neither stop nor

       examinations and tests of the Work as the Contracting Authority or 
       Scientific Authority may think fit.  The Contractor shall provide

       (c) All the Deliverables furnished or rendered under the Contract 
       shall be subject to inspection by the Scientific Authority prior to 
       acceptance.  Where a Deliverable, or any portion thereof, is not in 
       accordance with the requirements of the Contract, then the 
       Scientific Authority shall have the right to reject it or require 
       its correction. 

       (d) The Contractor shall adhere to the Scientific Authority's 
       interpretation of the Work Statement set out in the Contract insofar 
       as such interpretation is not contradictory to the wording of the 
       Work Statement.       

       (e) Inspection or acceptance shall not relieve the Contractor from 
       responsibility for failure to meet the requirements of the Contract.

       Inspection Authority includes quality assurance authority.

       delivery, such Prototypes shall be free from all defects in material 
       and workmanship and in conformance with the requirements of the 
       Contract; provided that with respect to Crown property furnished by 
       Canada, the Contractor's warranty shall only extend to its proper 
       installation in the Prototypes.

       by the Contracting Authority, and shall be paid the fair and 
       reasonable costs (including reasonable travelling and living 
       expenses) incurred in so doing with no allowance thereon by way of 
       profit, less a sum equivalent to the costs of correcting or making 
       good the Prototype had it been corrected or made good at the 
       Contractor's plant.       

       (d) In the event that a warranty of a supplier to the Contractor is 
       for a time period less than the time period stated in paragraph (a), 
       then, unless the Contractor advised the Minister and the Scientific 
       Authority in writing prior to acceptance, the above warranty period 
       shall apply.
