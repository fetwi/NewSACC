Priorities and Allocations System) regulations, stating that for contracts under 
this value, "use of a priority rating is optional, provided that delivery of the 
needed items can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of a priority

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This Contract concerns a Canadian defence requirement and therefore 
       is eligible to be assigned a "U.S. Priority Rating" for any 
       materials/services imported from the United States which may be 
       required in the performance of the Work.  Accordingly, the 
       Contractor shall:

       (a)    make an application to the Central Allocations and Defence 
              Priorities Section, Public Works and Government Services 
              Canada (PWGSC), Gatineau, Quebec  K1A 0S5, in the event that 
              any materials/services are to be imported from the United 
              States for the performance of the Work; and

       (b)    include this clause in subcontracts with Canadian suppliers, 
              and quote the PWGSC Contract Number therein.

2.     Failure to take the above actions may jeopardize the Contractor's 
       delivery commitments. Therefore, the Contractor assumes sole 
       responsibility for any breach of this Contract that arises from such 
       a failure.
