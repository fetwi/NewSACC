Canada will declare non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada. If it is determined, after contract award, that the Bidder made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to terminate the Contract for default. The Bidder will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested.  The Bidder and any of the Bidder's parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any contract arising from this bid solicitation.

<h2>GI17 (2012-07-16) Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement<br/>
process, bidders are advised that Canada may reject a bid in the<br/>
following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of<br/>
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any<br/>
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any<br/>
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of<br/>
interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of<br/>
their respective employees or former employees had access to<br/>
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available<br/>
to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or<br/>
appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing<br/>
or has provided the goods and services described in the bid<br/>
solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be<br/>
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating<br/>
a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the criteria established<br/>
above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this<br/>
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and<br/>
provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before<br/>
making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a<br/>
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority<br/>
before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that<br/>
it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to<br/>
have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within<br/>
Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of<br/>
interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest<br/>
or unfair advantage exists.</li>
