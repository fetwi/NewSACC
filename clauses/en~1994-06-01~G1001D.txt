<pre>1.     It shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to decide 
       whether or not any other insurance coverage, in addition to the 
       insurance requirements stipulated in the bid solicitation and 
       resulting contract, is necessary for its own protection or to fulfil 
       its obligations under the Contract.  Any such additional insurance 
       shall be provided and maintained by the Contractor at its own 
       expense.

       The foregoing insurance provisions shall not limit any insurance 
       required by federal, provincial or municipal law.

2.     To meet the insurance requirements of the Contract, the Contractor 
       shall forward to the Contracting Authority, upon the execution of 
       the Contract, either a certified true copy of the insurance policy 
       or the certificate of insurance containing reasonable detail of the 
       insurance coverage, exclusions, deductibles and conditions applying 
       to such policies and confirming that the insurance is in force to 
       meet these requirements.
