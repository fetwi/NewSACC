<strong>1028   01     (01/06/91)    Interpretation</strong>

1.     Unless otherwise provided in the agreement,

       a <strong>"</strong><strong><em>Design Change</em></strong><strong>" </strong>is any change to approved drawings, specifications, 
       or statements of requirements.  Work necessary to eliminate "fouling
       " points or for the correction of errors made by the Contractor is 
       not a "<em>Design Change</em>" within the meaning of this section;

       <strong>"</strong><strong><em>the General Conditions</em></strong><strong>"</strong> means <em>General Conditions</em> DSS-MAS 1026A 
       (Supplies - Firm Price) forming part of the Contract;

       <strong>"</strong><strong><em>Inspector</em></strong><strong>"</strong> means the inspection authority designated in the 
       Contract to carry out the inspection duties;

       the expression <strong>"make modifications of, changes in, or additions to, 
       the specifications,"</strong> as the same is employed in section 19 of<em> the 
       General Conditions</em> (DSS-MAS 1026A), shall be deemed to include and 
       to apply to "<em>Design Change</em>s" as herein before defined.

       <strong>"</strong><strong><em>these supplemental conditions</em></strong><strong>"</strong> means these Supplemental General 
       Conditions;

       <strong>"</strong><strong><em>vessels</em></strong><strong>"</strong> means the ships or <em>vessels</em> to be constructed by the 
       Contractor under the Contract and includes the whole of their 
       respective hulls, engines, boilers, machinery, auxiliaries, 
       equipment, fittings, and appurtenances where the context permits, 
       the term "work" as used in the Contract includes the <em>vessels</em> as 
       herein defined;

2.     These supplemental conditions shall be read with<em> the General 
       Conditions</em>, provided that, in the event of any inconsistencies 
       between the provisions of <em>the General Conditions</em> and of <em>these 
       supplemental conditions</em>, the latter shall prevail.

3.     Where the <em>Inspector</em> is not specifically mentioned in the Contract, 
       the Minister may act in respect of any covenant, agreement, 
       condition or matter under the Contract by or through the <em>Inspector</em> 
       or by or through such other officers as he may from time to time 
       designate, with power in the <em>Inspector</em> or any such officers to 
       delegate in writing or by telegram any of the powers contained in 
       the Contract.


<strong>1028   02     (01/06/91)    Conduct of Work</strong>

1.     Canadian Labour

       To the full extent consistent with availability, proper economy and 
       the expeditious performance of the Contract, the Contractor will 
       employ Canadian labour exclusively.  A reasonable proportion of the 
       labour force employed will consist of persons who have been 
       demobilized or honourably discharged from Active Service in Her 
       Majesty's Forces, where such persons are available and qualified for 
       the Work to be performed.

2.     Materials

       The Contractor hereby warrants, represents, and agrees that it will 
       procure all materials, parts, components and equipment required in 
       connection with the performance of Contract from the sources 
       proposed in its tender or such other sources as may be authorized by 
       the Minister.

3.     Performance Control

       The Contractor may, at any time, apply to the Minister for advice or 
       direction on matters pertaining to the Contract.

       The Contractor shall submit for examination by the <em>Inspector</em> and/or 
       the Minister all proposed Contracts including those to be effected 
       by Purchase Orders, if requested to do so.  

       The Contractor shall permit the <em>Inspector</em> to examine any designs, 
       drawings, models or specifications, completed or under preparation 
       by it or on its behalf in connection with the Contract at any time.  

       All directions and instructions that may, from time to time, be 
       given by the <em>Inspector</em> and/or the Minister with respect to the 
       recording and reporting upon the conduct, progress and cost of the 
       work, shall be duly carried out by the Contractor. 


<strong>1028   03     (01/06/91)    Inspector Final Judge of Work, Materials, etc.</strong>

If any part of the specifications provides for a method of construction or 
for the supply and/or use of materials, equipment or parts which are not 
specified with particularity, the Contractor shall have the right of 
selection provided that the construction so performed and the materials, 
equipment and parts so supplied and/or used are in accordance with good 
marine building practice for the type and class of <em>vessels</em> covered by the 
Contract, and provided that the specifications and drawings and all other 
Contract requirements are fully complied with.  The <em>Inspector</em> shall be the 
final judge of the quality, quantity and suitability of the workmanship, 
parts, materials, plant, machinery, apparatus, tools and equipment used in 
or for the purposes of the Work and as to the meaning or interpretation of 
the specifications and his decision with regard to the foregoing matters, 
or any of them, shall be final and binding upon the Contractor.  All orders, 
directions or instructions at any time given by the <em>Inspector</em> with respect 
to the Work or the conduct or progress thereof or with respect to the parts, 
materials, plant, apparatus, machinery, tools or equipment used in or for 
the purposes of the work, shall be promptly and fully complied with by the 
Contractor.


<strong>1028   04     (01/06/91)    Re-execution of Inferior Work</strong>

The <em>Inspector</em> may reject or refuse to accept or approve any part of the 
materials or Work if, in his opinion, the same or any workmanship, parts or 
materials used in the manufacture or production thereof are not in 
accordance with the provisions of the Contract.  The Contractor shall 
forthwith at its own expense replace or otherwise make good to the 
satisfaction of the <em>Inspector</em> any part of the materials or Work which may 
have been rejected by the <em>Inspector</em>.  Her Majesty shall not be under any 
liability hereunder for any Work done, materials, or parts delivered or 
assembly made by the Contractor hereunder, unless and until the same shall 
have been approved by the <em>Inspector</em> as evidenced by his certificate in 
writing.


<strong>1028   05     (01/06/91)    Drawings</strong>

1.     All drawings, copies of drawings and models, which have been 
       prepared by the Contractor pursuant to the Contract or furnished to 
       the Contractor by Her Majesty, shall be the sole property of Her 
       Majesty and may be used as Her Majesty sees fit.

2.     Approval of the drawings, whether express or implied, shall not 
       relieve the Contractor of its responsibility under the Contract to 
       deliver a vessel that will meet the performance requirements in the 
       specifications.

3.     Where modifications are requested to the drawings prior to their 
       approval, the Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted such 
       modifications and to have agreed that they do not constitute a 
       change in specifications and that they will not affect the 
       performance of the vessel adversely, unless it notifies the Minister, 
       in writing, within fourteen (14) days after receipt by it or notice 
       of the modification, that it considers that such modification 
       constitutes a change in specification or that it will adversely 
       affect the performance of the vessel.  In the event that the 
       Contractor does not withdraw such notice, it shall be deemed to be 
       relieved of any liability for failure of the vessel to perform in 
       accordance with the warranty insofar as such failure can be shown to 
       be the direct result of such modification.  

4.     The provisions of the preceding subsection shall apply to <em>Design 
       Change</em>s, "mutatis mutandis".  

<strong>1028   06     (01/06/91)    Design Changes and Modifications</strong>

1.     Any adjustment to the Contract price made pursuant to section 19 
       (Suspension of Work and Change in Specifications) of<em> the General 
       Conditions</em> DSS-MAS 1026A shall be ascertained and agreed to by the 
       parties hereto prior to the purchase of any materials or the 
       commencement of any Work by the Contractor. 

2.     If the Contractor proposes to make a claim for adjustment of the 
       Contract price pursuant to section 19 as aforesaid, it must furnish 
       notice to the Minister of its intention to do so within thirty (30) 
       days of the date that it received information that a change within 
       the scope of section 19 has been made.  Failure by the Contractor to 
       give such notice within the prescribed period shall be deemed to 
       constitute a waiver by it of any rights that it may have hereunder 
       to adjustment in the Contract price as a result of such change.


<strong>1028   07     (01/06/91)    Labour Conditions</strong>

       or other staff employed by Her Majesty, such office space, office 
       facilities, telephone service, and suitable sanitary and washing

       time at the Contractor's shipyard.

2.     Storage and Handling

       The Contractor shall supply suitable warehouse accommodation for all 
       government supply stores issued in connection with the Contract for 
       such length of time as the Minister may direct.  The Contractor 
       shall be responsible for the care, handling, embarking, loading, 
       moving and similar duties in respect of supply stores in the custody 
       or control of the Contractor or of the <em>Inspector</em> as the <em>Inspector</em> or 
       the Minister may from time to time direct. 


<strong>1028   09     (01/06/91)    Care of Vessel during Construction</strong>
 
1.     All parts of the vessel including, but not limited to, structure, 
       paint work, machinery, auxiliaries, appliances and apparatus shall 
       be maintained in a satisfactory condition during the entire period 
       of construction.  Measures shall be taken to keep to a minimum any 
       wear and damage incident to construction, and to prevent corrosion, 
       or other deterioration, especially to unpainted, polished and moving 
       parts.  All water piping, heat exchangers, valve chests and 
       equipment shall be kept drained, flushed, and cleaned except during 
       trials and tests.  Cold weather precautions will be taken when 
       conditions so require. 

2.     The Contractor shall be responsible for the care of all machinery 
       and equipment whether furnished by him or by the Crown.  Electrical, 
       electronic and interior communication equipment shall, at all times,

       and shall not be subjected to rapid temperature changes.

3.     The Contractor shall ensure that the design form of the vessel is 
       maintained throughout the course of construction and that no 
       distortion of materials occurs which might cause locked-in stresses. 


<strong>1028   10     (01/06/91)    Wharfage and Dockage Fee</strong>

Until the completion of the Contract, the Contractor shall be responsible 
for and shall pay all expenses of wharfage, towage, dockage, running lines, 
electric light, heating water for testing and refilling the tanks and all 
other charges, fees, expenses and disbursements for incidental to the 
construction, launching and delivery of the vessel.  If at any time after 
the launching and before final acceptance of the said vessel, any 
contingency should arise making it, in the opinion of the <em>Inspector</em>, 
advisable to have such vessel placed in dock for survey, the Contractor 
shall dock the vessel at its own risk and expense. 


<strong>1028   11     (01/06/91)    Overhanging Charges</strong>

In the event of any assessments, taxes or duties, or other levies or 
charges whatsoever, being unpaid after the vessel has been formally 
accepted by the Minister, and Her Majesty has complied with all the 
provisions imposed upon Her by the Contract, the Contractor shall reimburse 
Her Majesty within thirty (30) days thereafter for any such assessments, 
taxes, duties, levies or charges as may have been paid by Her Majesty. 


<strong>1028   12     (01/05/93)    Warranty</strong>

fittings, and equipment of all kinds, for a full period of twelve (12) 
months after delivery to and acceptance of the vessel by Her Majesty, 
excluding any time or times in excess of one (1) month upon any single 
occasion during which the vessel may be out of service while undergoing 
repair pursuant hereto, against all defects of design, material and 
workmanship, and undertakes that any part or parts of the vessel which may 
be found defective or show signs of weaknesses or undue wear within such 
period, owing to faulty design, material or workmanship, shall be repaired 
or removed and replaced and all such defects remedied and made good at the 
sole cost and expense of the Contractor.  An immediate notice in writing 
shall be given by the Minister to the Contractor of the discovery of any 
such defects, weakness or undue wear, and the Contractor agrees to deliver 
the necessary part or parts and to fit, complete and make good the 
defective part or parts at the Contractor's yard at _____, but if the 
vessel is not brought to the Contractor's yard for repairs or replacement 
of a defective part or parts and such repairs or replacements are made 
elsewhere, the Contractor shall pay to Her Majesty such sums as are 
equivalent to the cost of supplying the necessary part or parts and doing 
the Work at the yard of the Contractor.  The Contractor shall not be held 
responsible for fair wear and tear, or for breakage and defects arising 
through the negligence or carelessness of any person or persons employed on 
board the vessel during the warranty period, except the negligence or 
carelessness of the Contractor's representative if any.  The Contractor 
will not be held responsible for or be under any obligation for 
consequential damages and delays to the vessel or her cargo. 


<strong>1028   13     (01/06/91)    Public Ceremony</strong>

<strong>1028   14     (01/06/91)    Insurance</strong>

       Contractor shall bear and be subject to all risk of loss or damage 
       of or to the Work or any part thereof until delivery of the vessel 
       and final acceptance of same pursuant to the provisions hereof.  If 
       any such loss or damage should occur prior to such delivery and 
       final acceptance, the Contractor shall forthwith (unless otherwise 
       directed by the Minister or the <em>Inspector</em> and subject to such 
       conditions as the Minister or the <em>Inspector</em> may impose), at its own 
       expense and without making any claim for reimbursement therefor, 
       repair, restore and/or replace the Work or the part thereof so lost 
       or damaged.
 
2.     The Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Her Majesty against 
       and from any and all claims, damages, loss, costs and expenses which 
       Her Majesty may, at any time or times, suffer or incur as a result 
       of or arising out of any actual or alleged injury to persons 
       (including injuries resulting in death) or damage to property which 
       may be or be alleged to be caused by or suffered as a result of the 
       carrying out of this Contract or any part thereof, whether by the 
       Contractor or by any Subcontractor or assignee of the Contractor.

3.     The Contractor shall enter into a contract of insurance issued in 
       the joint names of the Contractor and Her Majesty as their 
       respective interests may appear in the standard form of Marine 
       Builder's Risk Policy to provide full indemnification to Her Majesty 
       for any loss or damage to the vessel or any other materials which 
       are the property of the Crown for installation in the vessel in the 
       custody of the Contractor or any claim or expenses to the Crown as 
       aforesaid for which the Contractor assumes responsibility hereunder, 
       and the premium or cost of such insurance coverage shall be 
       incorporated into and form part of the purchase price.
