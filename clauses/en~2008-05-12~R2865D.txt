<h2>GC6.1 (2008-05-12) Changes in the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">At any time before issuance of a Certificate of
Completion, Canada may issue orders for additions, deletions or
other changes to the Work, or changes in the location or position
of the whole or any part of the Work, if the addition, deletion,
change or other revision is deemed by Canada to be consistent with
the general intent of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">An order referred to in paragraph 1) of GC6.1 shall
be in writing and given to the Contractor in accordance with GC2.3,
"Notices".</li>
<li value="3">Upon receipt of an order, the Contractor shall
promptly perform the work in accordance with the order as if the
order had appeared in and been part of the original Contract.</li>
<li value="4">If anything done or omitted by the Contractor
pursuant to an order increases or decreases the cost of the Work to
the Contractor, payment for the work shall be made in accordance
with GC6.4, "Determination of Price".</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC6.2 (2008-05-12) Changes in Subsurface Conditions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If, during the performance of the Work, the
Contractor encounters subsurface conditions that are substantially
different from the subsurface conditions described in the tender
documents supplied to the Contractor, or a reasonable assumption of
fact based thereon, the Contractor shall give notice to Canada
immediately upon becoming aware of the situation.</li>
<li value="2">If the Contractor is of the opinion that the
Contractor may incur or sustain any extra expense or any loss or
damage that is directly attributable to the changed subsurface
conditions, the Contractor shall within 10 days of the date the
changed subsurface conditions were encountered, give Canada written
notice of intention to claim for that extra expense, loss or
damage.</li>
<li value="3">If the Contractor has given a notice referred to in
paragraph 2) of GC6.2, the Contractor shall give Canada a written
claim for extra expense, loss or damage no later than 30 days after
the date that a Certificate of Substantial Performance is
issued.</li>
<li value="4">A written claim referred to in paragraph 3) of GC6.2
shall contain a sufficient description of the facts and
circumstances of the occurrence that is the subject of the claim to
enable Canada to determine whether or not the claim is justified,
and the Contractor shall supply such further and other information
for that purpose as Canada requires.</li>
<li value="5">If Canada determines that a claim referred to in
paragraph 3) of GC6.2 is justified, Canada shall make an extra
payment to the Contractor in an amount that is calculated in
accordance with GC6.4, "Determination of Price".</li>
<li value="6">If, in the opinion of Canada, the Contractor effects
a saving of expenditure that is directly attributable to a
substantial difference between the information relating to
subsurface conditions at the site of the Work that is contained in
the tender documents, or a reasonable assumption of fact based
thereon, and the actual subsurface conditions encountered by the
Contractor, the Contract Amount shall be reduced by the amount of
the saving of expenditure determined in accordance with GC6.4,
"Determination of Price".</li>
<li value="7">If the Contractor fails to give a notice referred to
in paragraph 2) of GC6.2 and a claim referred to in paragraph 3) of
GC6.2 within the times stipulated, an extra payment shall not be
made to the Contractor in respect of the occurrence.</li>
<li value="8">Canada does not warrant the content expressed in any
subsurface report available for the perusal of the Contractor that
does not form part of the tender and contract documents.</li>

</ol>
<h3>GC6.4.2 Price Determination Following Completion of

Work or supply the Plant and Material required to complete the item
and payment shall be made for the actual Work performed or Plant
and Material supplied at the price per unit set out in the
Contract.</li>
<li value="2">If the final quantity of the price per unit item
exceeds the estimated tendered quantity by more than 15 percent,
either party to the Contract may make a written request to the
other party to negotiate an amended price per unit for that portion
of the item which exceeds 115 percent of the estimated tendered
quantity, and to facilitate approval of any amended price per unit,
the Contractor shall, on request, provide Canada with
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">detailed records of the actual cost to the Contractor
of performing or supplying the tendered quantity for the price per
unit item up to the time the negotiation was requested; and</li>

required for the portion of the item that is in excess of 115
percent of the tendered quantity.</li>

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">there is a demonstrable difference between the unit
cost to the Contractor of performing or supplying the estimated
tendered quantity and the unit cost to the Contractor for
performing or supplying the final quantity; and</li>
<li value="2">the difference in unit cost is due solely to the
decrease in quantity and not to any other cause.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">For the purposes of the negotiation referred to in
paragraph 4) of GC6.4.3
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the onus of establishing, justifying and quantifying
a proposed change lies with the party making the request for
negotiation; and</li>
<li value="2">in no event shall the total price for an item that
has been amended as a result of a reduction in quantity pursuant to
paragraph 4) of GC6.4.3 exceed the amount that would have been
payable to the Contractor had 85 percent of the tendered quantity
actually been performed or supplied.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC6.5 (2008-05-12) Delays and Extension of Time</h2>

the Contract Security.</li>
<li value="3">Subject to paragraph 4) of GC6.5, no payment, other
than a payment that is expressly stipulated in the Contract, shall
be made by Canada to the Contractor for any extra expense, loss or
damage incurred or sustained by the Contractor due to delay,
whether or not the delay is caused by circumstances beyond the
control of the Contractor.</li>
<li value="4">If the Contractor incurs or sustains any extra
expense or any loss or damage that is directly attributable to any
neglect or delay that occurs after the date of the Contract on the
part of Canada in providing any information or in doing any act
that the Contract either expressly requires Canada to do or that
would ordinarily be done by an owner in accordance with the
practice of the trade, the Contractor shall give Canada written
notice of intention to claim for that extra expense or loss or
damage within ten working days of the date the neglect or delay
first occurred.</li>
<li value="5">When the Contractor has given a notice referred to in
paragraph 4) of GC6.5, the Contractor shall give Canada a written
claim for the extra expense, loss or damage no later than 30 days
after the date that a Certificate of Completion is issued and not
afterwards.</li>
<li value="6">A written claim referred to in paragraph 5) of GC6.5

paragraph 5) of GC6.5 is justified, Canada shall make an extra
payment to the Contractor in an amount that is calculated in
accordance with GC6.4, "Determination of Price".</li>
<li value="8">If the Contractor fails to give a notice referred to
in paragraph 4) and a claim referred to in paragraph 5) of GC6.5
within the times stipulated, an extra payment shall not be made to
the Contractor in respect of the occurrence.</li>
