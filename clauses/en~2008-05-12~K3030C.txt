<pre>1.     In this section, "Material" means anything that is created or 
       developed by the Contractor as part of the Work under the Contract, 
       and in which copyright subsists.

2.     The Contractor grants to Canada a non-exclusive, perpetual, 
       irrevocable, world-wide, fully-paid and royalty-free license to 
       exercise all rights comprised in the copyright in the Material, for 
       any government purposes.  Canada may use independent contractors in 
       the exercise of Canada's license pursuant to this clause.

3.     Copyright in any translation of the Material made by or for Canada 
       belongs to  Canada. Canada agrees to reproduce the Contractor's 
       copyright notice, if any, on all copies of the Material, and to 
       acknowledge the Contractor's title to the copyright in the original 
       Work on all copies of translations of the Material effected by or 
       for Canada.

4.     No restrictions other than those set out in this section must apply 
       to Canada's use of copies of the Material or of translated versions 
       of the Material.

5.     At the request of Canada, the Contractor must provide to Canada, at 
       the completion of the Work or at such other time as Canada may 
       require, a written permanent waiver of moral rights, in a form 
       acceptable to Canada, from every author that contributed to the 
       Material.  If the Contractor is an author of the Material, the 
       Contractor permanently waives its moral rights in respect of the 
       Material.
