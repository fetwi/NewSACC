<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all contracts awarded on a requirement to which the 
Canadian Content policy had been applied and (a) the competition had been solely 
limited to bids offering Canadian goods and/or services; or (b) the competition 
had been conditionally limited to bids offering Canadian goods and/or services, 
and a sufficient number of bids had been received so that further consideration 
was or would have been given only to those bids offering Canadian goods and/or 
services. (Note that in both such cases the successful bidder will have 
completed and submitted a certification of Canadian content.)  
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Contractor represents and warrants that the certification of Canadian 
Content submitted with its bid is accurate and complete, and that the goods 
and services to be provided to Canada pursuant to this Contract will be in 
accordance with the said certification. The Contractor acknowledges that 
the Minister has relied upon such representation and warranty to enter into 
this Contract. Such representation and warranty may be verified in such 
manner as the Minister may reasonably require.

The Contractor acknowledges that in the event of a breach of such covenant, 
the Minister shall have the right to treat the Contract as being in default 
in accordance with the default provisions of the Contract.

The Contractor shall keep proper records and documentation relating to the 
origin of the goods and services provided to Canada. The Contractor shall 
not, without the prior written consent of the Minister, dispose of any such 
records or documentation until the expiration of six (6) years after final 
payment of this Contract, or until settlement of all outstanding claims and 
disputes, whichever is later. All such records and documentation shall at 
all times during the aforementioned retention period be open to audit, 
inspection and examination by the authorized representatives of the 
Minister, who may make copies and take extracts thereof. The Contractor 
shall provide all facilities  for such audits, inspections and examinations, 
and shall furnish all such information as the representatives of the 
Minister may from time to time require with respect to such records and 
documentation.

Nothing in this clause shall be interpreted as limiting the rights and 
   remedies which Canada or the Minister may otherwise have in relation to 
   or pursuant to this Contract.
