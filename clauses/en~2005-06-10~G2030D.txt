<pre>1.     Aviation Liability insurance shall be effected by the Contractor and 
       maintained in force throughout the duration of the Contract, in an 
       amount usual for a contract of this nature, but, in any case, for a 
       limit of liability NOT LESS THAN $5,000,000 per accident or 
       occurrence and in the annual aggregate.

2.     The following endorsements must be included:

       (a)    Additional Insured:  Canada is included as an additional 
              insured, but only with respect to liabilities that may arise 
              from the Contractor's own negligence in the performance of 
              the Contract.

              The interest of Canada as additional insured should read as 
              follows: Canada, represented by ________ (<strong class="wsStyleUnderline">insert client 
              department's name</strong>) and/or Public Works and Government 
              Services Canada.

       (b)    Notice of Cancellation or Amendment:  The Insurer agrees to 
              provide the Contracting Authority thirty (30) days written 
              notice of policy cancellation.

       (c)    Cross Liability:  Without increasing the limit of liability, 
              the policy shall protect all insured parties to the full 
              extent of coverage provided.  Further, the policy shall apply 
              to each Insured in the same manner and to the same extent as 
              if a separate policy had been issued to each.  

       (d)    Contractual Liability:  The policy shall, on a blanket basis 
              or by specific reference to this Contract, extend to assumed 
              liabilities with respect to contractual insurance provisions.

       (e)    Employees and (where applicable) Volunteers as Additional 
              Insured:  All employees and (where applicable) volunteers, on 
              behalf of the Contractor, shall be included as additional
