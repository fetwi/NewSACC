<strong>GC4.4  (2007-05-25)  Contaminated Site Conditions</strong><strong></strong>

1)     For the purposes of GC4.4, a contaminated site condition exists when 
       a solid, liquid, gaseous, thermal or radioactive irritant or 
       contaminant, or other hazardous or toxic substance or material, 
       including moulds and other forms of fungi, is present at the site of 
       the Work to an extent that constitutes a hazard, or potential hazard, 
       to the environment, property, or the health or safety of any person.

2)     If the Contractor encounters a contaminated site condition of which 
       the Contractor is not aware or about which the Contractor has not 
       been advised, or if the Contractor has reasonable grounds to believe 
       that such a site condition exists at the site of the Work, the 
       Contractor shall

       (a)    take all reasonable steps, including stopping the Work, to 
              ensure that no person suffers injury, sickness or death, and 
              that neither property nor the environment is injured or 
              destroyed as a result of the contaminated site condition; 

       (b)    immediately notify Canada of the circumstances in writing; 
              and

       (c)    take all reasonable steps to minimize additional costs that 
              may accrue as a result of any work stoppage.

3)     Upon receipt of a notification from the Contractor, Canada shall 
       promptly determine whether a contaminated site condition exists, and 
       shall notify the Contractor in writing of any action to be taken, or 
       work to be performed, by the Contractor as a result of Canada's 
       determination.

4)     If the Contractor's services are required by Canada, the Contractor 
       shall follow the direction of Canada with regard to any excavation, 
       treatment, removal and disposal of any polluting substance or 
       material.

5)     Canada, at Canada's sole discretion, may enlist the services of 
       experts and specialty contractors to assist in determining the 
       existence of, and the extent and treatment of contaminated site 
       conditions, and the Contractor shall allow them access and 
       co-operate with them in the carrying out of their duties and 
       obligations.

6)     Except as may be otherwise provided for in the Contract, the 
   provisions of GC6.4, "Determination of Price" shall apply to any 
   additional work made necessary because of a contaminated site condition.
