<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in bid solicitations which allow security deposits as 
bid security. 
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The security deposit shall be held by Canada as security for entry into 
contract and the furnishing of required contract security acceptable to 
Canada.  In the event of any default or non-performance by the Bidder, the 
said sum shall be forfeited to Canada, up to the amount of the difference 
between the bid price and the amount of the contract entered into by Canada 
for the work, supplies and services which are specified in this bid.  
Otherwise, a security deposit will be dealt with as follows:

       (a)  it will be returned to the unsuccessful Bidder when a contract 
       is awarded;

       (b)  it will be returned to the Contractor if surety bonds are 
       permitted and submitted as contract financial security;

       (c)  it will be applied to and form part of contract financial 
   security if surety bonds are not submitted.  Security deposits in the 
   form of bills of exchange shall be deposited to the credit of the 
   Consolidated Revenue Fund and shall bear simple interest, calculated on 
   the basis of the rates which are in effect during the period that the 
   deposit is held.  These rates are published monthly by the Department of 
   Finance and are set to be equal to the average yield on 90-day Treasury 
   Bills less 1/8 of 1 percent. Interest shall be paid annually or, if the 
   term of the deposit is less than twelve (12) months, when the security 
   deposit is returned to the Contractor.  A Contractor may, however, 
   request the Minister to hold and not cash the bill of exchange, in which 
   case no interest will become payable.
