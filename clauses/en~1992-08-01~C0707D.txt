<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Please refer to Annex "__" for a breakdown of the requirement and the 
estimated hours, per location.

This is an ESTIMATION only of the total service required and is intended to 
be a general guide to proposers in planning their costing submission. The 
list is based on service known to be required during the Standing Offer 
period and of the date of this request for Standing Offer and is subject to 
changes to reflect the actual service required. The actual service required 
will be called-up by the Consignee on DSS form 942.

Although the estimate is based on current estimated usage and plans, it 
must be understood that security guard needs are subject to a wide variety 
of operational activities, with varying hours and events, changing 
locations at the worksite, budgets and policies. Accordingly, guard 
requirements can be expected to change in terms of levels, quantity and 
location at the worksite.
