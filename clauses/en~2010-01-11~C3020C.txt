became due and payable.</li>

application of the provisions contained in this clause will be
applied for increases or decreases in the exchange rate within a

amount claimed for exchange rate adjustment under the

 <abbr title="Canada Border Services Agency">CBSA</abbr> form B3-3, Canada Customs Coding Form. When the goods,
services or both have not been imported, the Contractor must
provide evidence, satisfactory to Canada, that the amount claimed
is due and payable in foreign currency by the Contractor.</li>
