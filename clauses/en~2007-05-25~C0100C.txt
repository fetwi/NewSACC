<pre>The Contractor's certification that the price or rate is not in excess of 
the lowest price or rate charged anyone else, including the Contractor's 
most favoured customer, for the like quality and quantity of the goods, 
services or both, is subject to verification by government audit, at the 
discretion of Canada, before or after payment is made to the Contractor.

If the audit demonstrates that the certification is in error after payment 
is made to the Contractor, the Contractor must, at the discretion of Canada, 
make repayment to Canada in the amount found to be in excess of the lowest 
price or rate or authorize the retention by Canada of that amount by way of 
deduction from any sum of money that may be due or payable to the 
Contractor pursuant to the Contract.

If the audit demonstrates that the certification is in error before payment 
is made, the Contractor agrees that any pending invoice will be adjusted by 
Canada in accordance with the results of the audit.  It is further agreed 
that if the Contract is still in effect at the time of the verification, 
the price or rate will be lowered in accordance with the results of the 
audit.
