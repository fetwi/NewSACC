<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<p>Unless specified otherwise in the Contract, the price includes
no amount for any federal excise tax, state or local sales or use
tax, or any other tax of a similar nature, or any Canadian tax
whatsoever. The price, however, includes all other taxes. If the
Work is normally subject to federal excise tax, Canada will, upon
request, provide the Contractor a certificate of exemption from
such federal excise tax in the form prescribed by the federal
regulations.</p>
<p>Canada will provide the Contractor evidence of export that may
be requested by the tax authorities. If, as a result of Canada's
failure to do so, the Contractor has to pay federal excise tax,
Canada will reimburse the Contractor if the Contractor takes such
steps as Canada may require to recover any payment made by the
Contractor. The Contractor must refund to Canada any amount so
recovered.</p>
