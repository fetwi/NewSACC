<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In consideration of the Contractor receiving
ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground
Information, the Contractor agrees that manufacture of any product
incorporating or derived from the Foreground Information will be
done substantially in Canada and that the provision of any service
incorporating or derived from the Foreground Information will be
substantially from a base in Canada.</li>
<li value="2">The client department or agency for whom the Work is
being or was performed will determine what evidence will be
required to demonstrate that the obligation set out in subsection 1
has been met and will set the time period required to meet it. When
the obligation has been met in relation to any part of the
Foreground Information, the obligation will cease to apply to that
part of the Foreground Information.<br/>
If at the end of the period specified by the client department
or agency, the obligation to market and sell a product or service
as required has not yet been satisfied in relation to any part of
the Foreground Information, the Contractor must immediately submit
to the client department or agency, a report setting out:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">a description of the efforts that have been and will
be made by the Contractor to satisfy the obligation; and</li>
<li value="2">the reasons why the obligation has not been
satisfied.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">At the expiration of the period specified, if the
client department or agency for whom the Work is being or was
performed is satisfied that the Foreground Information is capable
of commercial exploitation in Canada but that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Contractor is incapable of achieving that;
or</li>
<li value="2">the Contractor has not made every reasonable effort
to fulfil the obligation; then that client department or agency may invoke either of the
remedies set out in subsection 5. If that department is satisfied
that the potential value to Canada of commercial exploitation of
the Foreground Information substantially in Canada so justifies, it
may also extend the time for the Contractor to fulfil the
obligation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4"><p>The Contractor agrees that any of the following,
affecting any part of the Foreground Information, would constitute
a breach of the Contractor's obligation entitling Canada to
exercise, in relation to that part of the Foreground Information,
the option to collect the liquidated damages provided for in the
Contract (if any) for such a breach, or, without affecting any
other remedy available at law or under the Contract, to exercise a
remedy set out in subsection 5:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Contractor or any affiliate, subcontractor or
agent of the Contractor manufactures outside Canada a product
incorporating or derived from the Foreground Information without
that product also being manufactured substantially in Canada, or
provides from a base outside Canada a service incorporating or
derived from the Foreground Information without that service also
being provided substantially from a base in Canada;</li>
<li value="2">through the act or omission, whether direct or
indirect, and whether deliberate or negligent, of the Contractor or
an employee or a subcontractor (including the sale or assignment of
the Foreground Information or license or other authorization of the
use of the Foreground Information), any person or entity is enabled
to manufacture outside Canada a product incorporating or derived
from the Foreground Information without that product also being
manufactured substantially in Canada, or to provide from a base
outside Canada a service incorporating or derived from the
Foreground Information without that service also being provided
substantially from a base in Canada;</li>
<li value="3">the Contractor or a controlling interest in the
Contractor, is acquired by a person not resident in Canada or by an
entity controlled outside of Canada, and that person, or other
entity does not enter into an agreement with the department or
agency for whom the Work is being or was carried out concerning the
use of the Foreground Information, promptly and before a breach
described in paragraph (a) or (b) has occurred; or</li>
<li value="4">to the extent permitted by the laws applicable in
Canada, the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit of
any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or the
Contractor suffers the appointment against it of a receiver under a
debt instrument or by a court, or an order is made or a resolution
passed for the winding up of the Contractor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">In the event of a breach of subsection 3 or 4, the
client department or agency for whom the Work is being or was
performed may, by notice, either:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">require the Contractor to assign or transfer to
Canada at no cost the Intellectual Property Rights in the
Foreground Information; or</li>
<li value="2">require the Contractor to provide to one or more
persons, or other entities specified by that client department or
agency at no cost a non-exclusive, perpetual, unconditional,
irrevocable, world-wide, and royalty-free license permitting the
commercial exploitation of the Intellectual Property Rights in the
Foreground Information, including the right to further develop the
Foreground Information and to own the Intellectual Property Rights
in any such further development.</li>
</ol>
The Contractor agrees that it will promptly execute such
transfer documents relating to ownership or licensing as the client
department or agency may require, and that it will afford that
department or agency or a licensee, as the case may be, at that
party's expense all reasonable assistance in the preparation of
applications and in the prosecution of any application for
registration of any Intellectual Property Rights in any
jurisdiction arising out of the Foreground Information, including
without limitation the assistance of the inventor in the case of an
invention.</li>
<li value="6">In the event of a breach described in paragraph (a)
or (b) of subsection 5 , in addition to all other remedies
available to Canada at law or under the Contract, the Contractor
must upon demand pay to Canada any net revenues earned by the
Contractor as a result of the breach.</li>
