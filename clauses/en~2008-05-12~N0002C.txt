<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use the following clause in contracts when limiting a contractor's liability to 
Canada and requiring the contractor to indemnify Canada against third party 
claims.
 </p>
<p>
  Limiting a contractor's liability should be an exception to the normal practice 
of using the standard conditions.  When the decision is made to limit a 
contractor's liability to Canada, contracting officers, in conjunction with 
client departments, must be able to demonstrate that the risks associated with 
the procurement have been analyzed and that the limitation of liability provides 
adequate protection to Canada.  Decisions with respect to limiting a 
contractor's liability should be made before bid solicitation release or, in 
instances of non-competitive contracts, before the start of negotiations.

  Clauses
  
   N0001C
  
  and
  
   N0002C
  
  are similar, in that both create a limit on the 
contractor's liability for damages to Canada.  However, the two clauses deal 
with the contractor's liability for claims made by third parties in different 
ways.  N0001C essentially provides that the parties agree to allow the laws in 
the jurisdiction of the contract to determine who is responsible for any damages 
to third parties.  It then goes on to provide that, if Canada must pay the third 
party for damages caused by the contractor because of joint and several 
liability, the contractor must reimburse Canada for that amount.  In short, 
under clause
  
   N0001C
  
  , each party is responsible for any damages that it causes to 
third parties.  On the other hand, clause
  
   N0002C
  
  states that the contractor must indemnify Canada against any third party claims that relate to the contract.
