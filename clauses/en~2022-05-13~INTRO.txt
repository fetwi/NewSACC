</ul> <p>The Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual is intended to provide suppliers and clients of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) with information on clauses and conditions used by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Acquisitions Branch contracting officers in the contracting process for procuring goods and services on behalf of client departments. Its contents are referred to in bidding opportunities and contracting activities.</p> <p>The <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual is designed to make dealing with the government more time and cost efficient by reducing the level of detailed text contained within the various procurement documents.
</p> <p>In ensuring that all procurement activities are conducted in accordance with the <cite>Official Languages Act</cite> (OLA), all content within the SACC Manual is available in both official languages (French and English).</p> <h2 id="2022-05-13INTRO10">How to use <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> clauses</h2> <p>The following information provides guidance on how to use <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> clauses.</p> <h3 id="2022-05-13INTRO20">Reference clauses</h3> <p><dfn>Reference</dfn> clauses are those clauses and conditions that bidders and suppliers must refer to the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual to obtain the full text. They are incorporated by reference in the solicitation or contractual document, as appropriate. Standard Instructions, General Conditions, Supplemental General Conditions and certain clauses are "incorporated by reference". The actual text in force in the contract is written out in full in the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual, rather than repeating them <cite>ad infinitum</cite> through all of the documents. This is done in part for reasons of economy and ecology. Procurement documents will contain references to specific standard instructions, general conditions and clauses which will apply to that particular requirement. Clause references will include the clause ID number, its effective date and its title (e.g. B1204C (2011-05-16) Shelf Life).</p> <h3 id="2022-05-13INTRO30">Full text clauses</h3> <p><dfn>Full text</dfn> clauses are those  clauses where the complete clause text must be inserted in the  solicitation or the contractual document, as appropriate. Users must not insert full text clauses with either the date or the clause ID number as such would cause a potential conflict with the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> clause, especially where changes to the full text clause may have been made.</p> <p>Most full text clauses are fill-in clauses  that require the insertion of specific information by the contracting officer or the bidder/supplier (e.g. B7012T (2008-05-12) Pre-production Samples - Clothing).</p> <h3 id="2022-05-13INTRO40">Copy and Paste into a Word document</h3> <p>In order to retain the numbering system within the text of a clause, contracting officers should first copy and paste the clause into a Word document, then copy it from that Word document and paste it in their Word document or template by clicking the Paste Options icon and choosing the option "match destination formatting".</p> <h2 id="2022-05-13INTRO50">How the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual is organized </h2> <p>The <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual is organized to follow the progression of information presented in procurement documents.</p> <p>The <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual contains information on current clauses and general conditions as well as instructions on how these clauses and conditions are used.  The manual also contains a complete text of previous clauses and conditions which have been either cancelled or superseded.</p> <p>The <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Supply Manual must be read as a complementary document to the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual.</p> <h3 id="2022-05-13INTRO60">Section 1 - Standard Instructions</h3> <p>Standard instructions  are included in all solicitations (competitive and non-competitive).  The standard instructions to include is determined based on the nature of the solicitation method. The standard instructions are always incorporated by reference and form part of the solicitation document.</p> <p>Supplemental standard instructions are also included in this section.</p> <h3 id="2022-05-13INTRO70">Section 2 - Templates</h3> <p>Public Works and Government Services Canada has implemented departmental standard procurement templates to facilitate the use of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) by the Acquisitions Branch contracting officers in their acquisition documents for the procurement of goods and services on behalf of client departments.</p> <p>There are currently five procurement templates addressing the different methods of supply and complexity of solicitations for competitive and non-competitive procurements.</p> <h3 id="2022-05-13INTRO80">Sections 3 and 4 - General Conditions and Supplemental General Conditions </h3> <p>Sections 3 and 4 present those sets of general conditions that will apply to and form part of any contract resulting from the solicitation which form the foundation upon which all procurement documents issued by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> are built.</p> <p>Section 3, General Conditions, defines the basic sets of conditions which apply to specific classes of contracts (e.g. 2035, General Conditions - Higher Complexity - Services).</p> <p>Section 4, Supplemental General Conditions, addresses areas unique to specific subclasses of contracts (e.g. 4005, Telecommunications Services and Products). </p> <p>Each section within a General Conditions set has its own effective date.  The General Conditions set as a whole has an effective date which is determined by the latest revision date of one or more of its sections.</p> <h3 id="2022-05-13INTRO90">Section 5 - Standard Procurement Clauses</h3> <p>Section 5 contains a collection of procurement clauses, common to various classes of contracts.  The full text of individual clauses, incorporated by reference into a solicitation or contract by their number, effective date and title, can be found in this section of the Manual.  Each subsection (A to V) is devoted to a particular subject area.  Note that some subsections have not been assigned at this time.</p> <p>Clauses may be identified by their numbers which break down as follows:</p> <ol type="a">
<li value="1">the first alphabetic character (A to Z) indicates the subsection in Section 5;</li>
<li value="2">the four numeric characters (0000 to 9999) indicate the clause's position within the numeric sequence of the subsection;</li>
<li value="3">the final alphabetic character (T or C) indicates the type of document in which a given clause would be used (i.e. <abbr title="Tender">T</abbr> = Tender (Solicitation); <abbr title="Contract">C</abbr> = Contract).</li>
</ol> <p>Example:	Clause C0004T, Price Certification - Canadian Agency and Resale Outlets.  This is the fourth clause found in subsection <abbr title="Contract">C</abbr> - Price, of Section 5 and is used in solicitations.</p> <h2 id="2022-05-13INTRO100">Updates to the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual</h2> <p><abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> clauses and conditions are updated as required and future solicitations and contracts will incorporate the new ones.
