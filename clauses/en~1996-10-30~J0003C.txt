<pre>Use the following text when preparing a Termination for Convenience where the 
contractor has indicated that no claim will be filed.

Terminations shall not be declared without a written legal opinion. In seeking 
the opinion of Legal Services, the contracting officer must submit the contract 
file with a chronological, typed index of the documents forming the basis for 
the termination request, together with a short note outlining the events leading 
to termination. Based on this information, Legal Services will render an opinion 
as to whether the contractor would have a valid defence, should the Crown claim 
loss or damages, and advise as to the appropriate method of termination.
