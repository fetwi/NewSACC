              (vi)   Contract Number, Financial Codes, and Client Reference 
                            Number as shown on page 1 of the Contract.

       (b)    all the certificates appearing on the said form are signed by 
              the respective persons indicated thereon or their delegate;

       (c)    the claim is accompanied by the required copies of the report;

       (d)    the report is accepted by the Technical Authority;

       (e)    the claim is approved by the Contracting Authority and the 
              Technical Authority; and

       (f)    two (2) sets of backup documentation (receipts, vouchers, etc.) 
              to support the claim are supplied to the Contracting 
              Authority designated herein.

2.     The Contractor shall prepare and certify an original and two (2) 
       copies of its claim on form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111.  The claim will be 
       forwarded to the Contracting Authority who will certify the claim 
       and forward it to the Technical Authority for certification and 
       payment.

3.     The balance owing shall be paid to the Contractor, subject to:

       (a)    completion and acceptance of the Work; 

       (b)    the submission of all deliverable items to the Technical 
              Authority; and 
 
       (c)    the approval of the final claim by the Technical Authority 
              and the Contracting Authority.

4.     Progress payments shall be regarded as interim payments only and 
       Canada shall have the right to conduct interim cost/time 
       verifications or audits and to make adjustments from time to time 
       during the performance of the Work.  Any overpayments resulting from 
       such progress payments or otherwise shall be refunded promptly to 
       Canada.

5.     Payment by Canada to the Contractor for the Work shall be made:

       (a)    in the case of a progress payment other than the final 
              payment, within thirty (30) days following the date of 
              receipt of the duly completed form PWGSC-TPSGC 1111;

       (b)    in the case of a final payment, within thirty (30) days 
              following the date of receipt of the duly completed form 
              PWGSC-TPSGC 1111, or within thirty (30) days following the 
              date on which the Work is completed, 

       whichever date is the later.

6.     If Canada has any objection to the form of the progress claim, 
       within fifteen (15) days of its receipt, Canada shall notify the 
       Contractor of the nature of the objection.  "Form of the claim" 
       means a claim which contains or is accompanied by such 
       substantiating documentation as Canada requires.  Failure by Canada 
       to act within fifteen (15) days will only result in the date 
       specified in subsection 5 of the clause to apply for the sole 
       purpose of calculating interest on overdue accounts.
