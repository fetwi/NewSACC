<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The following clauses must be incorporated into the conditions of the 
Contractor's Commercial General Liability insurance policy:

(A)    "<strong><em>Additional Named Insured</em></strong>:  Canada is named as an Additional Named 
       Insured under any liability insurance policies for Canada's 
       respective rights and interests under the Contract."

(B)    "<strong><em>Cross Liability</em></strong>:  Any act or omission by one or another of the 
       Insured hereunder shall not prejudice the rights or interests of any 
       other Insured.  This policy, subject to its limits of liability, 
       shall apply to each Insured in the same manner and to the same 
       extent as if a separate policy had been issued to each.  The 
       inclusion herein of more than one Insured shall not operate to 
       increase the limits of the Insurers' liability."

(C)    "<strong><em>Litigation Rights</em></strong>:  It is understood and agreed that where any suit 
       is instituted for or against Canada which the Insurer or Insurers 
       would, but for this clause, have the right to pursue or defend on 
       behalf of Canada as an Additional Named Insured under this insurance 
       policy, the Insurer shall promptly contact the Attorney General of 
       Canada to agree on the legal strategies by sending a registered 
       letter, or by courier with an acknowledgement of receipt, to:

       Senior General Counsel 
       Civil Litigation Section
       Department of Justice
       East Memorial Building
       284 Wellington Street, 2nd Floor
       Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

       The notification must be followed, within a reasonable period, by an 
       information copy to the Contracting Authority.

       The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right to co-defend 
       any action brought against Canada.  However, all expenses incurred 
       by Canada to co-defend such actions would be at Canada's expense."

(D)    "<strong><em>Notice of Cancellation or Amendments of Insurance Coverage</em></strong>:  The 
       Insurer agrees to give the Contracting Authority at least thirty (30) 
       days written notice of any policy cancellation or any changes in the 
       policy coverage."
