<h2>Authority</h2>
<p>Under the authority of the <cite>Department of Public Works and
Government Services Act</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"21.(1) The Minister may fix terms and conditions of contracts,
and instructions and terms and conditions with respect to other
documents relating to contracts and their formation.</p>
<p>Designation (2) The terms and conditions and instructions may be
identified by number or other designation and may be incorporated
in a contract or other document by reference to their number or
other designation.</p>
<p>Publication (3) The Minister may, by regulation, prescribe the

</blockquote>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>The <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC)
Manual is produced in two electronic versions - HTML and PDF. Both
versions contain information on current clauses and conditions as
well as instructions on how these clauses and conditions are used.
They also provide the reader with the complete text of previous
general conditions, supplemental general conditions and/or clause
found in the Manual, that have been either cancelled or
superseded.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Manual has been organized to follow the progression of
information presented in procurement documents:</p>
<h3>Section 1 - Standard Instructions and Conditions</h3>
<p>Previously printed on the reverse of page 1 of solicitations and
contracts, or included as attachments, these instructions and
conditions are now identified in standard clause <span class="clauseRef">A0000T</span>, located at the beginning of the clause
section in procurement documents.</p>
<h3>Section 2 - Templates</h3>
<h4>Departmental Standard Procurement Templates</h4>
<p>This section provides templates for low dollar value, medium
complexity and high complexity requirements, requests for standing
offers and requests for supply arrangements, as well as the
procedures for their use.</p>
<p>The development of the standard procurement documents is an
initiative of the Department whose objectives are to standardize
procurement terminology, simplify the language, and ensure more
consistency and uniformity in acquisition documents issued by the
Department.</p>
<h3>Sections 3 and 4 - General Conditions and Supplemental General
Conditions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">These sections present those sets of standard
conditions which form the foundation upon which all procurement
documents issued by PWGSC are built.
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Section 3, General Conditions, defines the basic sets
of conditions which apply to specific classes of contracts (e.g.
2010A, General Conditions - Goods (Medium Complexity)).</li>
<li value="2">Section 4, Supplemental General Conditions, addresses
areas unique to specific subclasses of contracts (e.g. 4001,
Hardware Purchase, Lease and Maintenance).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Each section/article within a condition set has been
given its own effective date. The condition set as a whole has also
been given an effective date which is reflected in section 00 and
is determined by the latest revision date of one or more of its
sections.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Section 5 - Standard Procurement Clauses</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">This section contains a collection of national
procurement clauses, common to various classes of contracts. The
full text of individual clauses, incorporated by reference into a
bid solicitation or contract by their number, effective date and
title, can be found in this section of the Manual. Each subsection
(A-Z) is devoted to a particular subject area. Please note that
some subsections have not been assigned at this time.</li>
<li value="2">Clauses may be identified by their numbers which
break down as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the first alphabetic character (A-Z) indicates the
subsection in Section 5;</li>
<li value="2">the four numeric characters (0000-9999) indicate the
clause's position within the numeric sequence of the
subsection;</li>
<li value="3">the final alphabetic character (T or C) indicates the
type of document in which a given clause would be used (i.e. T =
Tender; C = Contract ).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: Clause <span class="clauseRef">C0004T</span>, Price
Certification - Canadian Agency and Resale Outlets. This is the
fourth sequential clause found in subsection C - Price, of Section
5 and is used in bid solicitations.</p>
<h2>Use of the Manual</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1"><strong>Incorporation by Reference clauses (R)</strong>
<p>Bid solicitations and contracts will contain references to
specific clauses and general conditions which will apply to that
particular requirement. Clause references will include the clause
number, its effective date and its title (e.g. <span class="clauseRef">B1505C</span> (2006-06-16) Shipment of Hazardous
Materials). All clauses referred to in this manner can be found in
Section 5 of this Manual.</p></li>
<li value="2"><strong>Fill-in clauses (F)</strong>
<p>Clauses which require the insertion of specific information by
the contracting officer or the supplier (fill-in clauses) will be
produced in full text in procurement documents.</p>
<p class="description"><strong>NOTE</strong>: In the case of discrepancies in clause
versions between solicitation documents and the Manual, any clause
appearing in full text in a procurement document will override any
version set out in the Manual.</p></li>
<li value="3"><strong>Updates</strong>
<p>Any standard clause, and any condition or instruction set,
produced in full text or incorporated by reference in a bid
solicitation or contract may be updated from time to time in the
SACC Manual. When this happens, the version used in an
already-issued document will remain in effect in that document,
unless the updated version is legally incorporated.</p>
</li>
