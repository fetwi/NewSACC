<p>
  Use the following clause when the term "Technical Authority" is to be included 
in the contract (as requested by the client department).  If the term "Project 
Authority" is to be used instead, refer to clause
  
   A1022C
  
  .  If both terms 
"Technical Authority" and "Project Authority" are required in the contract, 
contracting officers must revise the responsibilities of both authorities to 
reflect their respective roles.
