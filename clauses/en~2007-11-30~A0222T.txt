<pre>1.     The price of the bid will be evaluated as follows:

       (a)    Canadian-based bidders must submit firm prices, Canadian 
              customs duties, and excise taxes included, and Goods and 
              Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) excluded.

       (b)    foreign-based bidders must submit firm prices, Canadian 
              customs duties and excise taxes and GST or HST excluded.

              will be added, for evaluation purposes only, to the prices 
              submitted by foreign-based bidders.

2.     Although Canada reserves the right to award the Contract either on 
       an FOB plant or FOB destination, Canada requests that bidders 
       provide prices FOB their plant or shipping point and FOB destination.  
       Bids will be assessed on an FOB destination basis.  

3.     For the purpose of the bid solicitation, bidders with an address in 
       Canada are considered Canadian-based bidders and bidders with an 
       address outside of Canada are considered foreign-based bidders.
