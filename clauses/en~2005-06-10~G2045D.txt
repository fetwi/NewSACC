<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>The Director's and Officer's Liability insurance provides important financial 
protection to the Contractor, and is applicable in long-term contracting for 
management and similar services, with organizations whose governance comprises 
both profit or non-profit Board of Directors.  Qualifying criteria include 
review of indemnity provisions provided by the organization to its Board's 
members.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $1,000,000 per loss is not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and Public Works and 
Government Services Canada's Risk Management and Insurance Advisory Services, at 
NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca.

The contracting officer should also refer to G2015D for important additional 
endorsements that may apply to specific contracting areas and that are to be 
individually selected and included in the endorsements found in this clause.
