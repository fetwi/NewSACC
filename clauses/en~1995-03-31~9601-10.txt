<strong>9601-10       03     (01/12/92)    Amendments and Waivers</strong>


       No amendment to the Contract shall be effective unless it is 
       incorporated into the Contract by written amendment executed by the 
       authorized representatives of the Minister and of the Contractor.  
       No waiver shall be valid, binding or affect the rights of the 
       Parties unless it is made in writing by, in the case of a waiver by 
       Canada, the authorized representative of Canada and, in the case of 
       a waiver by the Contractor, the authorized representative of the 
       Contractor.  The waiver by a Party of a breach of any term or 
       condition of the Contract shall not prevent the enforcement of that 
       term or condition by that Party in the case of a subsequent breach, 
       and shall not be deemed or construed a waiver of any subsequent 
       breach.


<strong>9601-10       04     (01/12/92)    Conduct of the Work</strong>


       (1)    The Contractor represents and warrants that:

              (a)    it is competent to perform the Work; and

              (b)    it has the necessary qualifications, including 
                     knowledge and skill, to perform the Work, together 
                     with the ability to use those qualifications 
                     effectively for that purpose.

       (2)    The Contractor shall supply everything necessary for the 
              performance of the Work.

       (3)    The Contractor shall:

              (a)    carry out the Work in a diligent and efficient manner;

              (b)    ensure that the Work:

                     (i)    is of proper quality, material and workmanship;

                     (ii)   is in full conformity with the Specifications; 
                            and

                     (iii)  meets all other requirements of the Contract.


<strong>9601-10       05     (01/12/92)    Compliance with Applicable Laws </strong>

<strong>9601-10       06     (01/12/92)    Assignment</strong>


       (1)    The Contract shall not be assigned, in whole or in part, by 
              the Contractor without the prior consent in writing of the 
              Minister and any purported assignment made without that 
              consent is void and of no effect.

       (2)    No assignment of the Contract shall relieve the Contractor 
              from any obligation under the Contract or impose any 
              liability upon Canada or the Minister, unless otherwise 
              agreed to in writing by the Minister.

 
<strong>9601-10       07     (01/12/92)    Time of the Essence</strong>


       Time is of the essence of the Contract.


<strong>9601-10       08     (01/12/92)    Excusable Delay</strong>


       In the event of any delay in performance of the Work due to force 
       majeure, the time for performance shall be extended for a period 
       equivalent to the time lost by reason of the force majeure, provided, 
       however, that the Contractor has advised the Minister of the event 
       of force majeure as soon as the Contractor has become aware of it, 
       and provided further that, in the event that the period of force 
       majeure exceeds 30 days, the Minister may, by giving written notice 
       to the Contractor, terminate the Contract, at no cost to Canada, as 
       regards all or any part of the Work not completed. If a termination 
       notice is given pursuant to this section, and if Canada has paid in 
       advance for all or any part of the terminated Work, such advance 
       shall be refunded to the Minister upon written demand therefor. In 
       this section, "force majeure" means fire, flood, riots, acts of the 
       enemy, acts of God, government action or any other cause reasonably 
       beyond the control of the Contractor.


<strong>9601-10       09     (01/12/92)    Payment</strong>


       (1)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Contract, no 
              payment shall be made to the Contractor unless and until:

              (a)    an invoice, inspection notes, certificates and any 
                     other documents required by the Contract have been 
                     submitted in accordance with the terms of the Contract 
                     and the instructions of the Minister;

              (b)    all such documents have been verified by the Minister;

              (c)    with respect to all parts of the Work in respect of 
                     which payment is claimed, the Contractor, where 
                     required to do so, establishes to the satisfaction of 
                     the Minister that such parts of the Work will be free 
                     from all claims, liens, attachments, charges or 
                     encumbrances; and 

              (d)    in the case of payment in respect of finished Work, 
                     the finished Work has been inspected by Canada and 
                     accepted as being in accordance with the Contract, 
                     including the Specifications.

       (2)    The Minister shall notify the Contractor, within 15 days of 
              receipt of an invoice, of any inadequacy of the invoice or of 
              the supporting documentation, and where any such notice is 
              given within that period the date for payment of the amount 
              invoiced shall be postponed until the Contractor remedies the 
              inadequacy to the satisfaction of the Minister.

<strong>9601-10       10     (01/12/92)    Interest on Overdue Accounts</strong>


       (1)    For the purposes of this section:

              "<strong>Bank Rate</strong>" means the discount rate of interest per annum set 
              by the Bank of Canada.

              "<strong>date of payment</strong>" means the date of the negotiable instrument 
              drawn by the Receiver General for Canada and given for 
              payment of an amount due and payable; and 
              an amount is "<strong>due and payable</strong>" when it is due and payable by 
              Canada to the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the 
              Contract;

              an amount becomes "<strong>overdue</strong>" when it is unpaid on the first 
              day following the day upon which it is due and payable.

       (2)    Subject to the Contract, Canada shall be liable to pay to the 
              Contractor simple interest at the Bank Rate plus 1 1/4 
              percent per annum on any amount that is overdue, from the 
              date such amount becomes overdue until the day prior to the 
              date of payment, inclusive. Interest shall be paid without 
              notice from the Contractor, but will only be paid if the 
              amount has been overdue more than 15 days. Canada shall not 
              be liable to pay interest on overdue advance payments.

       (3)    The Bank Rate shall be that prevailing at the opening of 
              business on the date of payment.

       (4)    Canada shall not be liable to pay interest in accordance with 
              this section if Canada is not responsible for the delay in 
              paying the Contractor.


<strong>9601-10       11     (01/12/92)    Changes in Taxes and Duties</strong>


       (1)    In this section "bid" includes a proposal, tender or offer 
              submitted by the Contractor in response to an invitation from 
              the Minister.

       (2)    Subject to subsection (3), in the event of any change 
              (including a new imposition or repeal), on or after the date 
              of submission of the bid, of any tax, customs or other duty, 
              charge, or any similar imposition that is imposed under sales 
              or excise tax legislation of the Government of Canada and 
              which affects the Cost to the Contractor of the Work, the 
              Contract Price shall be adjusted to reflect the increase or 
              decrease in the Cost to the Contractor.

       (3)    There shall be no adjustment under subsection (2) in respect 
              of any change that would increase the Cost to the Contractor 
              of the Work if public notice of the change was given before 
              the bid submission date in sufficient detail to permit the 
              Contractor to have calculated the effect on its Cost before 
              that date.

       (4)    The Contractor shall forward to the Minister a certified 
              statement showing the increase or decrease in Cost to the 
              Contractor that is directly attributable to the change in the 
              imposition. The Minister may verify the increase or decrease 
              in Cost by audit before or after the Contract Price is 
              adjusted.

       (5)    Notwithstanding subsections (2) to (4), no adjustment to the 
              Contract Price in respect of the Work or a part thereof shall 
              be made for a change in any imposition referred to in this 
              section that occurs after the date required by the Contract 
              for delivery of the Work or that part of the Work.


<strong>9601-10       12     (31/03/95)    Title</strong>


       (1)    Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, and except as 
              provided in subsection (2), title to the Work or any part 
              thereof shall vest in Canada upon delivery and acceptance 
              thereof by or on behalf of Canada.

       (2)    Upon any payment being made to the Contractor for or on 
              account of materials, parts, work-in-process or finished Work, 
              either by way of progress payments or accountable advances or 
              otherwise, title in and to all materials, parts, 
              work-in-process and finished Work so paid for shall vest in 
              and remain in Canada unless already so vested under any other 
              provision of the Contract.

       (3)    Notwithstanding any vesting of title referred to in this 
              section and except as otherwise provided in the Contract, the 
              risk of loss or damage to the materials, parts, 
              work-in-process or finished Work or part thereof so vested 
              shall remain with the Contractor until their delivery to 
              Canada in accordance with the Contract.  The Contractor shall 
              be liable for any loss or damage to any part of the Work 
              caused by the Contractor or any Subcontractor after such 
              delivery.

       (4)    Any vesting of title referred to in subsection (2) shall not 
              constitute acceptance by Canada of the materials, parts, 
              work-in-process or finished Work, and shall not relieve the 
              Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in 
              accordance with the Contract.

       (5)    Where title to any materials, parts, work-in-process or 
              finished Work becomes vested in Canada, the Contractor shall, 
              upon the Minister's request, establish to the Minister's 
              satisfaction that the title is free and clear of all claims, 
              liens, attachments, charges or encumbrances and shall execute 
              such conveyances thereof and other instruments necessary to 
              perfect that title as the Minister may request.

       (6)    If the Contract is a defence contract within the meaning of 
              the Defence Production Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. D-1, title to the 
              Work or to any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished 
              Work shall vest in Canada free and clear of all claims, liens, 
              attachments, charges or encumbrances, and the Minister shall 
              be entitled at any time to remove, sell or dispose of it or 
              any part of it in accordance with section 20 of that Act.


<strong>9601-10       13     (01/12/92)    Warranty</strong>


       (1)    Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance of the Work by or 
              on behalf of Canada and without restricting any other 
              provision of the Contract or any condition, warranty or 
              provision implied or imposed by law, the Contractor warrants 
              that, for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery, or 
              if acceptance takes place on a later date, the date of 
              acceptance, or for such other period as may be specified in 
              the written agreement between the Parties, the Work shall be 
              free from all defects in design, materials or workmanship, 
              and shall conform with the requirements of the Contract.

       (2)    In the event of a defect or nonconformance in any part of the 
              Work during the warranty period defined in subsection (1), 
              the Contractor, at the request of the Minister to do so, 
              shall as soon as possible repair, replace or otherwise make 
              good at its own option and expense the part of the Work found 
              to be defective or not in conformance with the requirements 
              of the Contract.

       (3)    The Work or any part thereof found to be defective or 
              non-conforming shall be returned to the Contractor's plant 
              for replacement, repair or making good; provided that, when 
              in the opinion of the Minister it is not expedient to remove 
              the Work from its location, the Contractor shall carry out 
              any necessary repair or making good of the Work at that 
              location, and shall be paid the fair and reasonable Cost 
              (including reasonable travelling and living expenses) 
              incurred in so doing, with no allowance therein by way of 
              profit, less an amount equal to the Cost of rectifying the 
              defect or non-conformance at the Contractor's plant.

       (4)    Canada shall pay the transportation cost associated with 
              returning any Work or part thereof to the Contractor's plant 
              pursuant to subsection (3), and the Contractor shall pay the 
              transportation cost associated with forwarding the 
              replacement or returning the Work or part thereof when 
              rectified to the delivery point specified in the Contract, or 
              such lesser cost as may be required to transport the Work or 
              part thereof to another location directed by the Technical 
              Authority.
 
       (5)    The warranties set out in subsection (1) shall apply for the 
              remainder of the warranty period to any part of the Work 
              repaired, replaced or otherwise made good pursuant to 
              subsection (2).  All of the provisions of subsections (2) to 
              (5) of this section apply mutatis mutandis to any such part 
              of the Work that is found during that period to be defective 
              or not in conformance with the Contract.

<strong>9601-10       14     (01/12/92)    Indemnity Against Third-party Claims</strong>


       The Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Canada, the 
       Minister and their servants and agents from and against any damages, 
       costs or expenses or any claim, action, suit or other proceeding 
       which they or any of them may at any time incur or suffer as a 
       result of or arising out of:

              (a)    any injury to persons (including injuries resulting in 
                     death) or loss of or damage to property of others 
                     which may be or be alleged to be caused by or suffered 
                     as a result of the performance of the Work or any part 
                     thereof, except that Canada and the Minister shall not 
                     claim indemnity under this section to the extent that 
                     the injury, loss or damage has been caused by Canada; 
                     and

<strong>9601-10       16     (01/12/92)    Default by the Contractor</strong>


       (1)    Where the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its 
              obligations under the Contract, the Minister may, upon giving 
              written notice to the Contractor, terminate for default the 
              whole or any part of the Contract, either immediately, or at 
              the expiration of a cure period specified in the notice if 
              the Contractor has not cured the default to the satisfaction 
              of the Minister within that cure period.

       (2)    Where the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an 
              assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit 
              of any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or 
              where a receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a 
              receiving order is made against the Contractor, or an order 
              is made or a resolution passed for the winding up of the 
              Contractor, the Minister may, upon giving notice to the 
              Contractor, immediately terminate for default the whole or 
              any part of the Contract.

       (3)    Upon the giving of a notice provided for in subsection (1) or 
              (2), the Contractor shall have no claim for further payment, 
              but shall be liable to Canada for any amounts, including 
              milestone payments, paid by Canada and for all losses and 
              damages which may be suffered by Canada by reason of the 
              default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, 
              including any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in 
              procuring the Work from another source.  Nothing in this 
              section affects any obligation of Canada under the law to 
              mitigate damages.


<strong>9601-10       17     (01/12/92)    Termination for Convenience</strong>


       (1)    Notwithstanding anything contained in the Contract, the 
              Minister may, at any time prior to the completion of the Work, 
              by giving notice to the Contractor (hereinafter sometimes 
              referred to as a "termination notice"), terminate the 
              Contract as regards all or any part of the Work not completed. 
              Upon a termination notice being given, the Contractor shall 
              cease work (including the manufacture and procuring of 
              materials for the fulfilment of the Contract) in accordance 
              with and to the extent specified in the notice, but shall 
              proceed to complete such part or parts of the Work as are not 
              affected by the termination notice. The Minister may, at any 
              time or from time to time, give one or more additional 
              termination notices with respect to any or all parts of the 
              Work not terminated by any previous termination notice.

       (2)    In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to 
              subsection (1), the Contractor shall be entitled to be paid, 
              to the extent that costs have been reasonably and properly 
              incurred for purposes of performing the Contract and to the 
              extent that the Contractor has not already been so paid or 
              reimbursed by Canada:

              (a)    on the basis of the Contract Price, for all completed 
                     Work that is inspected and accepted in accordance with 
                     the Contract, whether completed before, or after and 
                     in compliance with the instructions contained in the 
                     termination notice; 

              (b)    the cost to the Contractor plus a fair and reasonable 
                     profit thereon, for all Work terminated by the 
                     termination notice before completion, the cost to the 
                     Contractor being determined in accordance with the 
                     terms of the Contract and with Contract Cost 
                     Principles, DSS-MAS 1031-2;

              (c)    all Costs of and incidental to the termination of the 
                     Work or part thereof, but not including the cost of 
                     severance payments or damages to employees whose 
                     services are no longer required by reason of the 
                     termination except wages that the Contractor is 
                     obligated by statute to pay them and except for 
                     reasonable severance payments or damages paid to 
                     employees hired to perform the Contract whose hiring 
                     was expressly required by the Contract or approved in 
                     writing by the Minister for the purpose of the 
                     Contract.
 
       (3)    The Minister may reduce the payment in respect of any of the 
              Work to the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in 
              meeting the requirements of the Contract.

       (4)    Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2), the total of the 
              amounts to which the Contractor is entitled under paragraphs 
              (2)(a) and (b), together with any amounts paid or due or 
              becoming due to the Contractor under other provisions of the 
              Contract, shall not exceed the Contract Price or the portion 
              thereof that is applicable to the part of the Work that is 
              terminated.

       (5)    In the procuring of materials and parts required for the 
              performance of the Contract and in the Subcontracting of any 
              of the Work, the Contractor shall, unless otherwise 
              authorized by the Minister, place purchase orders and 
              Subcontracts on terms that will enable the Contractor to 
              terminate the same upon terms and conditions similar in 
              effect to those provided in this section, and generally, the 
              Contractor shall co-operate with the Minister and do 
              everything reasonably within its power at all times to 
              minimize the amount of Canada's obligations in the event of a 
              termination under this section.

       (6)    The Contractor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, 
              loss of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of, or 
              directly or indirectly arising out of, any action taken or 
              termination notice given by the Minister under this section, 
              except to the extent that this section expressly provides.

       Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders, shall derive any

       or other inducement has been or will be paid, given, promised or 
       offered directly or indirectly to any official or employee of Canada 
       or to a member of the family of such a person, with a view to 
       influencing the entry into the Contract or the administration of the 
       Contract.


<strong>9601-10       21     (01/12/92)    Severability</strong>


       If any provision of the Contract is declared by a court of competent 
       jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision 
       shall be severed from the Contract and all other provisions of the
