<ol type="1">
<li>	The Contractor agrees to comply with the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite> and to be bound by its terms. In addition, the Contractor must also comply with the terms set out in these Integrity Provisions.</li>
<li value="2">	The Contractor confirms that it understands that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences may result in a termination for default under the Contract. If the Contractor made a false declaration in its bid, makes a false declaration under the Contract, fails to diligently maintain up to date the information requested, or if the Contractor or any of the Contractor's Affiliates fail to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions during the contract period, such false declaration or failure to comply may result following a notice period in a termination for default under the Contract. The Contractor understands that a termination for default will not restrict Canada’s right to exercise any other remedies that may be available against the Contractor and agrees to immediately return any advance payments.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Contractor's Affiliates if: <br/>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.</li>
<li value="4">	The Contractor who is incorporated or who is a sole proprietorship has already provided a list of names of all individuals who are directors of the Contractor or the name of the owner. The Contractor who has submitted a bid as a joint venture has already provided a list of names of all directors, or the name of the owner, for each member of the joint venture. The Contractor must diligently inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list of names of directors during the contract period. The Contractor must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms and associated information, and cooperate to the verification process.</li>
<li value="5">	The Contractor certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware, that Canada may verify the information provided by the Contractor, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="6">	The Contractor certifies that neither the Contractor nor any of the Contractor's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Contract if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
<li value="7"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

In addition, for a conviction under paragraphs a. or b. of subsection 8, following the 10-year period, a pardon or a record suspension must have been obtained, or capacities must have been restored by the Governor in Council.

The Contractor also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Contractor nor any of the Contractor’s Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharged, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions. Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to the Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council.</li>
<li value="10"><dfn>Subcontractors</dfn><br/>
The Contractor must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no 	less favorable to Canada than those imposed in the resulting contract.</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
For governments, as well as entities controlled by a government, including Crown corporations, the present Integrity Provisions are reduced to complying with article 750 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, the <cite>Government Contracts Regulations</cite> and the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>.</li>
