<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor warrants that all hardware, software and firmware 
       products delivered or developed and any deliverables resulting from 
       the services provided, as an integrated system, shall meet or 
       operate as per the contractual requirement (as evidenced during 
       acceptance tests, as applicable) so as to accurately and 
       automatically process any and all date and date-related data 
       including, but not limited to calculating, comparing, and sequencing 
       of such data from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first 
       centuries, including leap year calculations when used in accordance 
       with the documentation provided by the Contractor and accepted by 
       Canada.

2.     To that end, the Contractor also warrants that date-related 
       processing will not, in any way, prevent hardware, software or 
       firmware from conforming to the requirement of the Contract prior to, 
       during, or after the year 2000.  Canada may, at no additional cost, 
       require the Contractor, at time of acceptance, to demonstrate 
       compliance and/or compliance techniques and test procedures it 
       intends to follow in order to comply with all of the obligations 
       contained herein.

3.     The obligations contained herein apply to the integrated system 
       provided by the Contractor and its subcontractor(s) involved in the 
       performance of this Contract.  The obligations contained herein do 
       not apply to hardware, firmware, software or software applications 
       provided as Government Property unless expressed elsewhere in the 
       Contract.

4.     The warranties contained herein are separate and discrete from any 
       other warranties specified in this Contract, and are not subject to 
       any disclaimer of warranty<em> </em>which may be specified in this Contract, 
       its appendices, its schedules, its annexes or any document 
       incorporated in this Contract by reference.  The warranties 
       contained herein are subject to any limitation of the Contractor's 
       liability specified in the Contract. 

5.     The warranties contained herein shall not apply where a modification 
       has been made to a deliverable provided under this Contract by a 
       party other than the Contractor or a subcontractor or a party 
       approved in writing by either of them.

6.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set out in the 
       applicable Supplemental General Conditions, if any, under the 
       section entitled "Warranty" apply.

7.     The warranties contained herein shall have a term extending  either:

       (a)    to June 30, 2000, or,
       (b)    for a period of six months following acceptance of the system 
              to which the hardware, software, firmware, as relevant, 
              relate,

       whichever is the later date.
