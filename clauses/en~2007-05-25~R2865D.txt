<strong>GC6.1  (2007-05-25)  Changes in the Work</strong>

1)     At any time before issuance of a Certificate of Completion, Canada 
       may issue orders for additions, deletions or other changes to the 
       Work, or changes in the location or position of the whole or any 
       part of the Work, if the addition, deletion, change or other 
       revision is deemed by Canada to be consistent with the general 
       intent of the Contract.

2)     An order referred to in paragraph 1) of GC6.1 shall be in writing 
       and given to the Contractor in accordance with GC2.3, "Notices".

3)     Upon receipt of an order, the Contractor shall promptly perform the 
       work in accordance with the order as if the order had appeared in 
       and been part of the original Contract.

4)     If anything done or omitted by the Contractor pursuant to an order 
       increases or decreases the cost of the Work to the Contractor, 
       payment for the work shall be made in accordance with GC6.4, "
       Determination of Price".

<strong>GC6.2  (2007-05-25)  Changes in Subsurface Conditions</strong>

1)     If, during the performance of the Work, the Contractor encounters 
       subsurface conditions that are substantially different from the 
       subsurface conditions described in the tender documents supplied to 
       the Contractor, or a reasonable assumption of fact based thereon, 
       the Contractor shall give notice to Canada immediately upon becoming 
       aware of the situation.

2)     If the Contractor is of the opinion that the Contractor may incur or 
       sustain any extra expense or any loss or damage that is directly 
       attributable to the changed subsurface conditions, the Contractor 
       shall within 10 days of the date the changed subsurface conditions 
       were encountered, give Canada written notice of intention to claim 
       for that extra expense, loss or damage.

3)     If the Contractor has given a notice referred to in paragraph 2) of 
       GC6.2, the Contractor shall give Canada a written claim for extra 
       expense, loss or damage no later than 30 days after the date that a 
       Certificate of Substantial Performance is issued.

4)     A written claim referred to in paragraph 3) of GC6.2 shall contain a 
       sufficient description of the facts and circumstances of the 
       occurrence that is the subject of the claim to enable Canada to 
       determine whether or not the claim is justified, and the Contractor 
       shall supply such further and other information for that purpose as 
       Canada requires.

5)     If Canada determines that a claim referred to in paragraph 3) of GC6.2 
       is justified, Canada shall make an extra payment to the Contractor 
       in an amount that is calculated in accordance with GC6.4, "
       Determination of Price".

6)     If, in the opinion of Canada, the Contractor effects a saving of 
       expenditure that is directly attributable to a substantial 
       difference between the information relating to subsurface conditions 
       at the site of the Work that is contained in the tender documents, 
       or a reasonable assumption of fact based thereon, and the actual 
       subsurface conditions encountered by the Contractor, the Contract 
       Amount shall be reduced by the amount of the saving of expenditure 
       determined in accordance with GC6.4, "Determination of Price".

7)     If the Contractor fails to give a notice referred to in paragraph 2) 
       of GC6.2 and a claim referred to in paragraph 3) of GC6.2 within the 
       times stipulated, an extra payment shall not be made to the 
       Contractor in respect of the occurrence.

8)     Canada does not warrant the content expressed in any subsurface 
       report available for the perusal of the Contractor that does not 
       form part of the tender and contract documents.

<strong>GC6.3  (2007-05-25)  Human Remains, Archaeological Remains and Items of 
                     Historical or Scientific Interest</strong><strong></strong>

              are not archaeological remains but may be of interest to 
              society because of their historical or scientific 
              significance, value, rarity, natural beauty, or other quality. 

2)     If, during the course of the Work, the Contractor encounters any 
       object, item or thing which is described in paragraph 1) of GC6.3 or 
       which resembles any object, item or thing described in paragraph 1) 
       of GC6.3, the Contractor shall

       (a)    take all reasonable steps, including stopping work in the 
              affected area, to protect and preserve the object, item or 
              thing;

       (b)    immediately notify Canada of the circumstances in writing; 
              and

       (c)    take all reasonable steps to minimize additional costs that

3)     Upon receipt of a notification in accordance with subparagraph 2)(b) 
       of GC6.3, Canada shall promptly determine whether the object, item 
       or thing is one described in, or contemplated by paragraph 1) of GC6.3, 
       and shall notify the Contractor in writing of any action to be 
       performed, or work to be carried out, by the Contractor as a result 
       of Canada's determination.

4)     Canada may, at any time, enlist the services of experts to assist in 
       the investigation, examination, taking of measurements or other such 
       recordings, placing of permanent protection around or removing of 
       the object, item or thing encountered by the Contractor, and the 
       Contractor shall, to the satisfaction of Canada, allow them access 
       and co-operate with them in the carrying out of their duties and 
       obligations. 

5)     Human remains, archaeological remains and items of historical or 
       scientific interest encountered at the site of the Work shall be 
       deemed to be the property of Canada.

6)     Except as may be otherwise provided for in the Contract, the 
       provisions of GC6.4, "Determination of Price ", and GC6.5, "Delays 
       and Extension of Time", shall apply.

<strong>GC6.4  (2007-05-25)  Determination of Price</strong>

       <strong>GC6.4.1       Price Determination Prior to Undertaking Changes</strong>

1)     If a Lump Sum Arrangement applies to the Contract or a part thereof, 
       the price of any change shall be the aggregate estimated cost of 
       labour, Plant and Material that is required for the change as agreed 
       upon in writing by the Contractor and Canada plus a negotiated 
       allowance for supervision, co-ordination, administration, overhead, 
       margin and the risk of undertaking the work within the stipulated 
       amount.

2)     If a Unit Price Arrangement applies to the Contract or a part 
       thereof, the Contractor and Canada may, by agreement in writing, add 
       items, units of measurement, estimated quantities and prices per 
       unit to the Unit Price Table.

3)     A price per unit referred to in paragraph 2) of GC6.4.1 shall be 
       determined on the basis of the aggregate estimated cost of labour, 
       Plant and Material that is required for the additional item as 
       agreed upon by the Contractor and Canada, plus a negotiated 
       allowance.

4)     To facilitate approval of the price of the change or the additional 
       price per unit as applicable, the Contractor shall submit a cost 
       estimate breakdown identifying, as a minimum, the estimated cost of 
       labour, Plant, Material, each subcontract amount, and the amount of 
       the negotiated allowance.

5)     If no agreement is reached as contemplated in paragraph 1) of GC6.4.1, 
       the price shall be determined in accordance with GC6.4.2.

6)     If no agreement is reached, as contemplated in paragraphs 2) and 3) 
       of GC6.4.1, Canada shall determine the class and the unit of 
       measurement of the item of labour, Plant or Material and the price 
       per unit shall be determined in accordance with GC6.4.2.

       <strong>GC6.4.2       Price Determination Following Completion of Changes</strong><strong></strong>

1)     If it is not possible to predetermine, or if there is failure to 
       agree upon the price of a change in the Work, the price of the 
       change shall be equal to the aggregate of

       (a)    all reasonable and proper amounts actually expended or 
              legally payable by the Contractor in respect of the labour, 
              Plant and Material that fall within one of the classes of 
              expenditure described in paragraph 2) of GC6.4.2, that are 
              directly attributable to the performance of the Contract;

       (b)    an allowance for profit and all other expenditures or costs, 
              including overhead, general administration costs, financing 
              and interest charges, in an amount that is equal to 10% of

              GC6.4.2; and

       (c)    interest on the amounts determined under subparagraphs 1)(a)

       expenditure:

       (a)    payments to Subcontractors and Suppliers;

       (b)    wages, salaries, bonuses and, if applicable, travel and

              bonuses and, if applicable, travel and lodging expenses of 
              personnel of the Contractor generally employed at the head 
              office or at a general office of the Contractor provided they 
              are actually and properly engaged on the Work under the 
              Contract;

       (c)    assessments payable under any statutory authority relating to

              environmental reviews, and GST/HST collection costs;

       (d)    rent that is paid for Plant, or an amount equivalent to the 
              said rent if the Plant is owned by the Contractor, that is 
              necessary for and used in the performance of the Work, if the 
              rent or the equivalent amount is reasonable and use of that 
              Plant has been approved by Canada; 

       (e)    payments for maintaining and operating Plant necessary for 
              and used in the performance of the Work, and payments for

              necessary for the proper performance of the Contract, other 
              than payments for any repairs to the Plant arising out of 
              defects existing before its allocation to the Work; 

       (f)    payments for Material that is necessary for and incorporated 
              in the Work, or that is necessary for and consumed in the

              Contract; and

       (h)    any other payments made by the Contractor with the approval 
              Canada that are necessary for the performance of the Contract

       <strong>GC6.4.3       Price Determination - Variations in Tendered 
                     Quantities</strong>

1)     Except as provided in paragraphs 2), 3), 4) and 5) of GC6.4.3, if it 
       appears that the final quantity of labour, Plant and Material under 
       a price per unit item shall exceed or be less than the estimated 
       tendered quantity, the Contractor shall perform the Work or supply 
       the Plant and Material required to complete the item and payment 
       shall be made for the actual Work performed or Plant and Material 
       supplied at the price per unit set out in the Contract.

2)     If the final quantity of the price per unit item exceeds the 
       estimated tendered quantity by more than 15%, either party to the 
       Contract may make a written request to the other party to negotiate 
       an amended price per unit for that portion of the item which exceeds 
       115% of the estimated tendered quantity, and to facilitate approval 
       of any amended price per unit, the Contractor shall, on request, 
       provide Canada with

       (a)    detailed records of the actual cost to the Contractor of 
              performing or supplying the tendered quantity for the price 
              per unit item up to the time the negotiation was requested; 
              and 

       (b)    the estimated unit cost of labour, Plant and Material 
              required for the portion of the item that is in excess of 115% 
              of the tendered quantity. 
 
3)     If agreement is not reached as contemplated in paragraph 2) of GC6.4.3, 
       the price per unit shall be determined in accordance with GC6.4.2. 

4)     If it appears that the final quantity of labour, Plant and Material 
       under a price per unit item shall be less than 85% of the estimated 
       tendered quantity, either party to the Contract may make a written 
       request to the other party to negotiate a change to the price per 
       unit for the item if

       (a)    there is a demonstrable difference between the unit cost to 
              the Contractor of performing or supplying the estimated 
              tendered quantity and the unit cost to the Contractor for 
              performing or supplying the final quantity; and

       (b)    the difference in unit cost is due solely to the decrease in 
              quantity and not to any other cause.

5)     For the purposes of the negotiation referred to in paragraph 4) of 
       GC6.4.3 

       (a)    the onus of establishing, justifying and quantifying a 
              proposed change lies with the party making the request for 
              negotiation; and

       (b)    in no event shall the total price for an item that has been 
              amended as a result of a reduction in quantity pursuant to 
              paragraph 4) of GC6.4.3 exceed the amount that would have 
              been payable to the Contractor had 85% of the tendered 
              quantity actually been performed or supplied.

<strong>GC6.5  (2007-05-25)  Delays and Extension of Time</strong>

1)     Upon application of the Contractor made before the date first fixed 
       for completion of the Work or before any other date previously fixed 
       under this clause, Canada may extend the time for completion of the 
       Work by fixing a new date if Canada determines that causes beyond 
       the control of the Contractor have delayed its completion.

2)     The Contractor's application shall be accompanied by the written 
       consent of the bonding company whose bond forms part of the Contract 
       Security.

3)     Subject to paragraph 4) of GC6.5, no payment, other than a payment 
       that is expressly stipulated in the Contract, shall be made by 
       Canada to the Contractor for any extra expense, loss or damage 
       incurred or sustained by the Contractor due to delay, whether or not 
       the delay is caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
       Contractor.

4)     If the Contractor incurs or sustains any extra expense or any loss 
       or damage that is directly attributable to any neglect or delay that 
       occurs after the date of the Contract on the part of Canada in 
       providing any information or in doing any act that the Contract 
       either expressly requires Canada to do or that would ordinarily be 
       done by an owner in accordance with the practice of the trade, the 
       Contractor shall give Canada written notice of intention to claim 
       for that extra expense or loss or damage within tenÂ working days of 
       the date the neglect or delay first occurred.

5)     When the Contractor has given a notice referred to in paragraph 4) 
       of GC6.5, the Contractor shall give Canada a written claim for the 
       extra expense, loss or damage no later than 30Â days after the date 
       that a Certificate of Completion is issued and not afterwards.

6)     A written claim referred to in paragraph 5) of GC6.5 shall contain a 
       sufficient description of the facts and circumstances of the 
       occurrence that is the subject of the claim to enable Canada to 
       determine whether or not the claim is justified and the Contractor 
       shall supply such further and other information for that purpose as 
       Canada may require.

7)     If Canada determines that a claim referred to in paragraph 5) of GC6.5 
       is justified, Canada shall make an extra payment to the Contractor 
       in an amount that is calculated in accordance with GC6.4, "
       Determination of Price".

8)     If the Contractor fails to give a notice referred to in paragraph 4) 
   and a claim referred to in paragraph 5) of GC6.5 within the times 
   stipulated, an extra payment shall not be made to the Contractor in 
   respect of the occurrence.
