<strong>01     (2004-12-10)  Submission of Quotation for Contemplated Change 
                            Notices</strong>

If the Engineer determines that the cost of the work will be affected due 
to a contemplated change, the Contractor shall submit a quotation to the 
Engineer in accordance with the instructions specified herein.

<strong>02     (2004-12-10)  General</strong>

1.     Quotations for Contemplated Change Notices must include a detailed 
       breakdown of all labour, material, plant and equipment costs 
       incurred by the Contractor.  Quotations from subcontractors involved 
       in the change must also be supported by similarly detailed 
       breakdowns of the subcontractors' costs.

2.     It is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure that all 
       subcontractors' quotations included in the Contractor's quotation to 
       the Engineer are fair and reasonable in view of the terms expressed 
       herein.

3.     The labour hours required for the contemplated change shall be based 
       on the estimated number of hours to perform the work.

4.     Time spent by a working foreman may be included in the number of 
       labour hours, at a rate agreed to in writing by the Contractor and 
       the Engineer.

5.     Time attributable to material handling, productivity factors and 
       approved rest periods is to be included in the number of hours 
       required by the contemplated change and will not be paid as a 
       separate item under hourly rates. 

6.     Markups referred to in sections 5 and 6 below are not to be included 
       in the hourly labour rates.

7.     Credit for work deleted will only be for the work directly 
       associated with the changes stipulated in the particular 
       Contemplated Change Notice.

8.     When a change deletes work which has not yet been performed, the 
       Engineer is entitled to an adjustment in the Contract Amount equal 
       to the cost the contractor would have incurred had the work not been 
       deleted.

9.     Markups referred to in Sections 5 and 6 below shall not be applied 
       to any credit amounts for deleted work.

10.    In those cases where the change involves additions and deletions to 
       the work, the percentage markups referred to in sections 5 and 6 
       below shall apply only when the cost of the additions minus the cost 
       of the deletions would result in an increase in the Contract Amount.  
       The percentage allowance shall only be applied to that portion of 
       the costs of the additions that is in excess of the cost of the 
       deletions.

11.    If the contemplated change in the work necessitates a change in the 
       contract completion date, or has an impact on the work, the 
       Contractor shall identify and include the resulting cost in the 
       breakdown of its quotation to the Engineer.

12.    The work shall conform to the contract documents unless otherwise 
       stated in the Contemplated Change Notice, Change Order or Site 
       Instruction signed by the Engineer.

13.    Upon acceptance of the Contractor's quotation by the Engineer, the 
       Engineer shall prepare and issue the formal Change Order.
