relieve the Contractor from any of its obligations under the
Contract or impose any liability upon Her Majesty or the

of Her Majesty and of the Contractor, respectively.</li>

explanation which the Contractor may require in regard to the
meeting and intent of any clause in the Specifications and
Contract, and shall be held responsible for any errors or losses
consequent upon failure to obtain such explanation.</li>
<li value="4">Drawings and Specifications are intended to
complement each other, so that if anything is shown on the drawings
but not mentioned in the Specifications, or vice versa, it is to be
furnished and built as though specifically set forth in both. If
any discrepancies are discovered in the drawings, or any conflict
between the drawings and the Specifications, the same shall be
referred to the Corporation before proceeding with the Work.
Figured dimensions on drawings are to have precedence.</li>
<li value="5">Materials used must conform to the Specifications
whether shown on the Corporation's or the Contractor's drawings or
not.</li>

drawings shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for
corrections thereof, nor for results arising from error or
omission.</li>

no Finished Work shall be submitted for acceptance or shall be
delivered unless or until approved by the Contractor's inspection

examination by the Inspector who may make copies thereof and take
extracts therefrom.</li>

quality and workmanship. The Inspector shall have full power to

so accepted and such acceptance shall be a condition precedent to
delivery. Provided always that if the Agreement provides for a
particular place or manner of delivery, such delivery shall not be
complete unless or until made in accordance therewith. Upon
delivery, title to the Work delivered shall vest in Her Majesty if

in process or any other Finished Work.</p>

Government Issue of the same kind or type is damaged or defective
(otherwise than as a result of the fault or negligence of the
Contractor), Her Majesty shall reimburse the Contractor for any
loss incurred by the Contractor which is directly attributable to

Any notice so given shall be deemed to have been received by the
Contractor at the time when in the ordinary course such letter or
telegram should have reached its destination.</p>
<h2 id="2004-12-10CCC50arbitration">CCC50 27 (1998-02-16) Arbitration</h2>
<p>In the event of any dispute between the parties with respect to
anything arising out of the Contract (save in respect of any matter
as to which the decision of the Corporation or of the Inspector or
other person is final or any matter with regard to which any other
manner of settlement is herein expressly provided), the matter in
dispute shall be referred for decision to a single arbitrator or,
if the parties cannot agree upon a single arbitrator, to two
arbitrators, one to be selected by the Corporation and the other by
the Contractor. In case the two arbitrators so selected cannot
agree, they shall select a third and the decision of any two of the
three shall be binding. In case the two arbitrators so selected
cannot agree upon the selection of the third arbitrator, the third
arbitrator shall be appointed by the Federal Court upon a reference
being made to such Court. A party who has not appointed an
arbitrator after the other party has appointed one shall do so
within five (5) days after being notified in writing by such other
party to do so, and in default of appointment such other party's
arbitrator may act as sole arbitrator whose decision shall be
binding. If the arbitrator of either party shall fail to proceed
with the consideration of the matters in dispute within five (5)
days after being required in writing by the other party's
arbitrator to do so, such other party's arbitrator, if a third
arbitrator has not been appointed, shall be at liberty to act as
sole arbitrator whose decision shall be binding, or the other two
arbitrators, if a third has been appointed, may forthwith appoint
an arbitrator in lieu of the one who has failed to proceed, and the
decision of two of such three arbitrators shall be binding. The

all or any part or parts of the Work not theretofore completed.
Upon a termination notice being given, the Contractor shall cease
Work (including the manufacturing and/or procuring of materials for

same (less any depreciation in respect thereof already taken into
account in determining cost) were reasonably and properly incurred
by the Contractor in respect of and are properly apportionable to
the performance of the Contract and not included in the amounts
paid or payable to the Contractor in respect of Finished Work;</li>
<li value="4">if the Contract is exclusively a Contract for the
making of capital expenditures in respect of additional equipment
and/or plant additions, the foregoing paragraphs (a) to (c)
inclusive of this subsection 2 shall not apply, but Her Majesty
shall pay or reimburse the Contractor for the reasonable and proper
cost to the Contractor (not previously paid by Her Majesty) of

any amount which taken together with any amounts paid or due or
becoming due to the Contractor under the Contract, shall exceed the
Contract Price applicable to the Work or the particular part
thereof.</li>

foregoing subsections 1 to 4 inclusive, the amounts which the
Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed in the event of the
giving of a termination notice under this section 28 shall include,
subject as hereinafter provided, the costs of the Contractor of an

Contractor pursuant to the termination notice, the cost of
preparing the necessary accounts and statements with respect to
Work performed to the effective date of such termination and/or
commitments made by the Contractor with respect to the terminated
portions of the Work, wages which the Contractor is obligated under
any laws and regulations for the time being in force, to pay to
employees whose services are no longer required by reason of such
termination, the costs of and incidental to the taking of an
inventory of materials, components, work in process and Finished
Work on hand at the effective date of the termination and other
costs and expenses of and incidental to the termination, in whole

satisfaction of the Corporation that the costs and expenses
aforesaid were actually incurred by the Contractor and that the
same are reasonable and are properly attributable to the
termination of the Work or the part thereof so terminated.</li>
<li value="6">In case of disagreement as to the amount which the
Contractor is entitled to be reimbursed, the matter shall be
referred to the Federal Court.</li>
<li value="7">As far as practicable, the Contractor shall place
purchase orders and subcontracts on terms that will enable the
Contractor to terminate the same upon conditions and terms similar
in effect to those provided in this section, and generally the
Contractor shall co-operate with the Corporation and do everything
reasonably within its power at all times to minimize and reduce the
amount of Her Majesty's obligations in the event of termination
hereunder.</li>

and/or work in process in respect of which reimbursement is made to
the Contractor as herein provided shall, upon such reimbursement
being made, pass to and vest in Her Majesty unless already so
vested under any other provision of the Contract and such
materials, parts, plant, equipment and/or work in process shall be
delivered to the order of the Corporation, but the materials thus
taken over will in no case be in excess of what would have been
required for performing the Contract in full if no termination
notice had been given.</li>
<li value="9">If the Corporation is satisfied that by reason of any
action taken under the provisions of this section exceptional
hardship has resulted to the Contractor, then the Corporation may,
in its absolute discretion, grant such allowance (not to include in
any case, however, an allowance or compensation for loss of profit)
to the Contractor as, in the opinion of the Corporation, is
warranted by the circumstances.</li>

compensation, loss of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of
or directly or indirectly arising out of any action taken or notice
given by the Corporation under or pursuant to the provisions of
