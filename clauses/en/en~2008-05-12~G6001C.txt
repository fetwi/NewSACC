<p>
  Use the following clause in contracts when vehicles are leased by Canada on a 
long-term basis.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must not insure the risks to Canada
arising from the use or operation of vehicles leased by Canada on a
long-term basis (over 30 days) except where Provincial law makes it
mandatory for the Contractor to insure any leased vehicles. Where
Provincial law makes it mandatory to insure a leased vehicle, the
Contractor must obtain insurance coverage in respect of the vehicle
supplied under the lease, and a copy or evidence of such insurance
is to be provided to Canada.</li>
<li value="2">Canada may decide not to purchase Collision, All
Perils or Comprehensive insurance. The option that must be chosen
by Canada when renting a vehicle must depend on the applicable
<cite>Treasury Board Risk Management Policy</cite>.</li>
<li value="3">In the event of an accident that is self-insured by
Canada (as Lessee), Canada must obtain a written estimate for the
repairs and, in consultation with the Contractor (as Lessor), must
decide where the repairs are to be performed. If the Contractor
decides to have the damage repaired at another place and the cost
of said repairs is higher then the estimate obtained by Canada,
Canada must only pay the lesser amount. Further, if the Contractor
decides that the vehicle is to be repaired at a place other then
the place Canada chooses, the Contractor must be responsible to pay
transport costs of the vehicle to the alternate location.</li>
<li value="4">When a rental vehicle is in a disabling accident, all
rental charges must cease on said vehicle.</li>
