<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in contracts when Public Works and Government Services 
Canada (PWGSC) has authorized use of a priority rating.

PWGSC is authorized to use the United States (U.S.) Defense Priorities and 
Allocations System (DPAS) regulation through annual applications to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce.  In operating under those authorities, PWGSC has a 
responsibility to monitor and report on the use of priority ratings.  Therefore, 
when the following clause is inserted in contracts dealing with Canadian 
Commercial Corporation contracts, the contracting officer has a responsibility 
to report its use by sending a copy of the contract to the Defence Priorities 
and Allocations Officer, Business Management Directorate, either in PDF format 
at the following e-mail address: NCR.ACQBDefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca; or a 
hardcopy by fax at: 819-956-1459.

NOTE:	A threshold of US$50,000 is included in the U.S. DPAS regulation (15 CFR 
Part 700.17), where it is stated that for contracts under this value, a priority 
rating is not required "provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely 
fashion without the use of the priority rating."

Contracting officers must consult the Supply Manual, procedures 6B.195, 6B.196 
and 7A.140 for more information on the application of a priority rating.</pre>

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This is an urgent United States (U.S.) government defence 
       requirement and use of a U.S. Priority Rating is hereby authorized 
       and assigned.  This Priority Rating is valid only for the purchase 
       of materials, sub-assemblies and components (excluding controlled 
       goods) by the Contractor directly from U.S. contractors up to a 
       total of US$ _____.  If the Contractor exceeds the dollar limitation, 
       the Contractor is authorized to proceed with the purchase order 
       while providing the Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, 
       Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), with details of 
       the additional amount required, either by e-mail at: NCR.ACQBDefencePriorities
       @pwgsc.gc.ca, or by facsimile at 819-956-1459.

2.     The assigned U.S. Priority Rating, required delivery date, signature 
       of an individual authorized to sign rated orders, and the following 
       certification must be placed on or attached to the Contractor's 
       purchase order to U.S. contractors:

              "This is a rated order certified for national defense use, 
              and the Contractor is required to follow all the provisions 
              of the U.S. Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems 
              regulation (15 CFR Part 350)."

3.     Assigned U.S. priority ratings may not be extended within Canada. In 
       consequence, when further materials are imported through the 
       Contractor's Canadian subcontractors or distributors, the following 
       paragraph must be added in the Contractor's purchase order with the 
       Canadian subcontractor:

              "PRIORITY ASSISTANCE: This is an urgent defence requirement.  
              If the Contractor is importing any material/service from U.S. 
              for the fulfilment of the Contract, contact the Defence 
              Priorities and Allocations Officer, PWGSC, to request a U.S. 
              Priority Rating."

4.     The Contractor must keep for a period of three (3) years, and 
       provide to Canada, on request, a record of its authority to use the 
       rating authorization and of all the uses made of it by the 
       Contractor.

5.     Special Priority Assistance:

If the Contractor needs assistance in obtaining delivery under a delinquent 
Rated Order with a U.S. contractor, the Contractor should contact the 
Defence Priorities and Allocations Officer, PWGSC.
