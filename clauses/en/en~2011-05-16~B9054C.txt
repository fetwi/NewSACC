<h2>Task Authorization:</h2>
<p>The Work or a portion of the Work to be performed under the
Contract will be on an "as and when requested basis" using a Task
Authorization (TA). The Work described in the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> must be in
accordance with the scope of the Contract.</p>
<p class="description"><strong>Instructions to contracting
officers:</strong> Insert the following paragraph when more than
one contract will be awarded.</p>
<blockquote>As more than one contract has been awarded for this requirement,
a request to perform a task will be sent to the first ranked
contractor. If that contractor confirms in writing that it is
unable to perform the task as a result of previous commitments
under a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>, the request to perform a task will then be forwarded to
the contractor ranked second. This process will continue until the
task can be performed by another contractor. If no contractor can
perform the task, Canada reserves the right to acquire the required
Work by other means. A contractor may advise the <span class="input-required"><var>__________</var> <kbd>(<i>insert "Project" or
"Technical" Authority</i>)</kbd></span> and the Contracting Authority in
writing that it is unable to carry out additional tasks as a result
of previous commitments under a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> and no request to perform a task
will be sent to that contractor until that contractor has given
notice in writing to the <span class="input-required"><var>__________</var> <kbd>(<i>insert "Project" or
"Technical" Authority</i>)</kbd></span> and the Contracting Authority
that it is available to perform additional tasks.</blockquote>
