       conformity with the <em>specifications</em>, drawings, models or samples, if 
       any.

2.     No materials or parts shall be used or processed and no <em>finished 
       work</em> shall be submitted for acceptance or shall be delivered unless 
       or until approved by the Contractor's inspection staff and, wherever

       records which shall at all times be open to examination by the <em>
       Inspector</em> who may make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom.

3.     The <em>Minister</em> and the <em>Inspector</em> shall have access to the <em>Work</em> at all 
       times and to the plant and premises where any part of the work is

acceptance.  Should the <em>Work</em> be defective in materials or workmanship or 
otherwise not be in accordance with the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>
Inspector</em> shall have the right to reject the <em>Work</em> or to require its 
correction.  Inspection by the <em>Inspector</em> either at the plant of the 
Contractor or of any of its subcontractors shall not relieve the Contractor

       requested by the <em>Minister</em> to do so at any time within 12 months from 
       the date of delivery, shall:

       (a)    replace or make good at its own expense any <em>finished work</em>, 
              excluding <em>Government Issue</em> incorporated therein, which 
              becomes defective or which fails to conform to contract 
              requirements as a result of faulty or inefficient manufacture, 
              material or workmanship

       (b)    deliver such <em>finished work</em> free from all defects to the 
              delivery point specified in the <em>Contract</em>, unless otherwise 
              agreed to by the <em>Minister</em>;

       provided that where, in the opinion of the <em>Minister</em>, it is not 
       expedient to remove such defective <em>finished work</em> from its location, 
       the Contractor shall replace or make good the defective <em>finished 
       work</em> at such location, and shall be paid the actual <em>cost</em> incurred in 
       so doing (including reasonable travelling and living expenses) with 
       no allowance thereon by way of overhead or profit, less a sum 
       equivalent to the <em>cost</em> of making good the defective <em>finished work</em>

       control.

constitutes mismanagement on the part of the Contractor, the <em>cost</em> of the

to the extent directed by the <em>Minister</em> shall not be considered as part of 
the <em>cost</em> of the <em>Work</em> and the Contractor shall not be reimbursed therefor.

of all property, title to which is vested in <em>Canada</em>, while the same is in, 
on or about the plant and premises of the Contractor or otherwise in his 
possession or subject to his control and shall be responsible for any loss 
or damage resulting from his failure to do so other than loss or damage 
caused by ordinary wear and tear. 
 
<strong>1026B  13     (01/06/91)    Time of Essence</strong>

Time shall be deemed to be of the essence of the <em>Contract</em> provided that the 
time for completing any of the <em>Work</em> which has been or is likely to be 
delayed by reason of force majeure or other cause beyond the reasonable 
control of the Contractor shall be extended 
by a period equal to the length of the delay so caused, provided that 
prompt notice in writing of the occurrence causing or likely to cause such 
delay is given to the <em>Minister</em>.

copies thereof and take extracts therefrom) at any time until the 
expiration of six (6) years from the end of the calendar year in which the <em>
Contract</em> is terminated or completed and the Contractor shall afford all 
facilities for such audits and inspections and shall furnish the <em>Minister</em>

consent of the <em>Minister</em>, dispose of any such accounts, records, invoices, 
receipts and vouchers until the expiration of six (6) years from the end of 
the calendar year in which the <em>Contract</em> is terminated or completed, but 
shall preserve and keep the same available for audit and inspection at any 
time during such retention period. 


<strong>1026B  15     (01/12/00)    Security and Protection of Work</strong>

       the Contractor by or on behalf of <em>Canada</em> in connection with the <em>Work</em>,

       and shall not disclose any such information to any person without 
       the written permission of the <em>Minister</em>, except that the Contractor 
       may disclose to a subcontractor, authorized in accordance with this <em>
       Contract</em>, information necessary to the performance of the 
       subcontract. This section does not apply to any information that:

       Works and Government Services Industrial Security Manual and its

3.     Without limiting the generality of subsections 1 and 2, when the <em>
       Contract</em>, the <em>Work</em>, or any information referred to in subsection (1) 
       is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL or PROTECTED by <em>
       Canada</em>, the <em>Minister</em> shall be entitled to inspect the Contractor's 
       premises and the premises of a subcontractor at any tier for 
       security purposes at any time during the term of the <em>Contract</em>, and 
       the Contractor shall comply with, and ensure that any such 
       subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by the <em>
       Minister</em> dealing with the material so identified, including any 
       requirement that employees of the Contractor or of any such 
       subcontractor execute and deliver declarations relating to

<strong>1026B  21     (01/12/00)    Title on Progress Payments</strong>

Upon any payment being made to the Contractor for or on account of 
materials, parts, work in process, or <em>finished work</em>, either by way of 
progress payments or accountable advances or otherwise, title in and to all 
materials, parts, work in process and <em>finished work</em> so paid for by such 
progress payments or accountable advances or otherwise shall vest and 
remain in <em>Canada</em>, unless already so vested under any provision of the <em>
Contract</em>, and the Contractor shall be responsible therefor in accordance 
with the provisions of section 12 <em>hereof</em>, it being understood and agreed 
that such vesting of title in <em>Canada</em> shall not constitute acceptance by <em>
Canada</em> of such materials, parts, work in process and <em>finished work</em> and 
shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations to perform the <em>Work</em> in 
conformity with the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>1026B  22     (13/12/99)    Further Assurances</strong>

Wherever it is <em>herein</em> provided that title to any parts, materials, work in

request.


<strong>1026B  23     (01/06/91)    Suspension of Work and Changes in

The <em>Minister</em> may at any time and from time to time order a suspension of 
the <em>Work</em>, in whole or in part, and make modifications of, changes in or 
additions to the <em>specifications</em>, changes in methods of shipment or packing 
and in the place or time of delivery. All directions given by the <em>Minister</em> 
with respect to the foregoing shall be complied with by the Contractor. 
Should any such suspension, modification, change or addition result in a 
material increase or decrease in the scope of the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may 
make an adjustment in the Contractor's fee and the <em>Minister</em>'s decision on 
the adjustment to be made shall be final.
 
<strong>1026B  24     (01/12/00)    Default by Contractor</strong>

1.     If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of the terms, 
       conditions, covenants or obligations of the <em>Contract</em>, or if the 
       Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or has a receiving order 
       made against it, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, 
       or if an order is made or resolution passed for the winding up of 
       the Contractor, or if the Contractor takes the benefit of any 
       statute for the time being in force relating to bankrupt or 
       insolvent debtors, the <em>Minister</em> may, by giving notice in writing to 
       the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of the <em>Contract</em>. In 
       such event, the Contractor shall not be entitled to the payment of 
       any fee or any portion thereof with respect to any of the <em>Work</em> not 
       completed by the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the <em>
       Contract</em> at the time of the said notice in writing to the Contractor.

2.     If after notice of termination of the <em>Contract</em> under the provisions 
       of subsection (1) of this section, it is determined by the <em>Minister</em> 
       that the default of the Contractor is due to causes beyond the 
       control of the Contractor, such notice of termination shall be 
       deemed to have been issued pursuant to section 25 (Termination) of 
       these general conditions, and the rights and obligations of the 
       parties hereto shall be governed by that section.

3.     Upon termination of the <em>Contract</em> under this section, the <em>Minister</em> 
       may require the Contractor to deliver to <em>Canada</em>, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the <em>Minister</em>, any <em>finished work</em> which has 
       not been delivered and accepted prior to such termination and any 
       materials, parts, work in process or tools which the Contractor has 
       specifically acquired or produced for the fulfilment of the <em>Contract</em>. <em>
       Canada</em> shall pay the Contractor for all such <em>finished work</em> delivered 
       pursuant to such direction and accepted by <em>Canada</em>, the <em>cost</em> to the 
       Contractor of such <em>finished work</em> plus the proportionate part of any 
       fee fixed by the said <em>Contract</em> and shall pay or reimburse the 
       Contractor the reasonable and proper <em>cost</em> to the Contractor of all 
       materials, parts or work in process delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to 
       such direction.


<strong>1026B  25     (01/12/00)    Termination</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding anything in the <em>Contract</em> contained, the <em>Minister</em> may, 
       by giving notice to the Contractor, terminate the <em>Contract</em> as 
       regards all or any part or parts of the <em>Work</em> not theretofore 
       completed. Upon such notice being given, the Contractor shall cease <em>
       Work</em> (including the manufacturing and procuring of materials for the 
       fulfilment of the <em>Contract</em>) in accordance with and to the extent 
       specified in such notice but shall proceed with all reasonable speed 
       to complete such part or parts (if any) of the <em>Work</em> as are by the 
       terms of such notice to be completed and shall also proceed with all 
       reasonable speed to complete up to such time or stage as may be 
       specified in the notice any part or parts of the <em>Work</em> as required by 
       such notice.  Furthermore, the <em>Minister</em> may, at any time or from 
       time to time, give one or more additional notices with respect to 
       any or all parts of the <em>Work</em> which remain to be completed after the 
       giving of any previous notice or notices.

2.     In the event of any notice given under the provisions of this 
       section, and subject as hereinafter provided:

       (a)    All <em>Work</em> completed by the Contractor <em>hereunder</em> before the 
              giving of such notice, and all <em>Work</em> completed thereafter 
              pursuant to such notice, shall be paid for (subject to 
              inspection and acceptance by <em>Canada</em>) in accordance with the 
              terms <em>hereof</em>;

       (b)    In respect of <em>Work</em> not completed <em>hereunder</em> before the giving 
              of such notice, and not completed thereafter pursuant to such 
              notice, <em>Canada</em> shall pay the Contractor's <em>cost</em> thereof as 
              determined under the provision <em>hereof</em>, and in addition an 
              amount representing a fair and reasonable profit in respect 
              of <em>Work</em> done thereon;

       (c)    Subject as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection 2, if 
              the <em>Contract</em> shall have specifically authorized or if the <em>
              Minister</em> shall have specifically approved the making of 
              capital expenditures by the Contractor to enable it to carry 
              out the <em>Contract</em>, the Contractor shall be entitled to be 
              reimbursed the amount of such capital expenditures so 
              authorized or approved (and actually made or incurred) to the 
              extent that the same (less any depreciation in respect 
              thereof already taken into account in determining <em>cost</em> in 
              accordance with the provisions of the <em>Contract</em>) were 
              reasonably and properly incurred by the Contractor in respect 
              of and are properly apportionable to the performance of the <em>
              Contract</em>;
 
       (d)    If the <em>Contract</em> is exclusively a <em>Contract</em> for the making of 
              capital expenditures in respect of additional <em>equipment</em> or 
              plant additions, the foregoing paragraphs (a) to (c) 
              inclusive of this subsection 2 shall not apply, but <em>Canada</em> 
              shall pay or reimburse the Contractor for the reasonable and 
              proper <em>cost</em> to the Contractor (not previously paid by <em>Canada</em>) 
              of:

              (1)    all additional <em>equipment</em> which, prior to the giving of 
                     the termination notice, shall have been purchased, 
                     acquired or manufactured by the Contractor, or 
                     contracted for and for which the Contractor is 
                     obligated to make payments, and

              (2)    all additional <em>equipment</em> in process of manufacture by 
                     the Contractor as at the date of the giving of such 
                     notice and all <em>Work</em> in connection with the 
                     construction of the plant addition up to the said date, 
                     including the <em>cost</em> of materials and parts contracted 
                     for by the Contractor for the purpose of such 
                     manufacture of construction and for which the 
                     Contractor is obligated to make payment.

3.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1 and 2, the amounts 
       which the Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed in the event 
       of the giving of a termination notice under this section 25 shall 
       include, subject as hereinafter provided, the costs of the 
       Contractor of and incidental to the cancellation of obligations 
       incurred by the Contractor pursuant to the termination notice, the <em>
       cost</em> of preparing the necessary accounts and statements with respect 
       to the <em>Work</em> performed to the effective date of such termination and 
       commitments made by the Contractor with respect to the terminated 
       portions of the <em>Work</em>, wages which the Contractor is obligated under 
       any laws or regulations for the time being in force, to pay to 
       employees whose services are no longer required by reason of such 
       termination, the costs of and incidental to the taking of an 
       inventory of materials, components, work in process and <em>finished 
       work</em> on hand at the effective date of the termination and other 
       costs and expenses of and incidental to the termination in whole or 
       in part, of operations under the <em>Contract</em> provided always that 
       payment and reimbursement under the provisions of this subsection 
       shall be made only to the extent that is established to the 
       satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> that the costs and expenses aforesaid 
       were actually incurred by the Contractor and that the same are 
       reasonable and are properly attributable to the termination of the <em>
       Work</em> or the part thereof so terminated.

4.     In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the <em>Contract</em> and in subletting of any <em>Work</em> <em>hereunder</em>, the 
       Contractor, unless otherwise authorized by the <em>Minister</em>, shall 
       procure or sublet on terms that will enable the Contractor to 
       terminate any contracts entered into by the Contractor upon the same 
       conditions and terms as those provided for in this section in 
       respect of the termination of the <em>Contract</em> by the <em>Minister</em> and the 
       giving of a notice or notices as aforesaid and upon the same 
       conditions and terms in respect of reimbursement and profit as those 
       contained in this section and in the event of the termination of the <em>
       Contract</em> as <em>herein</em> provided as regards all or any part of the <em>Work</em>, 
       the Contractor shall co-operate with <em>Canada</em> and the <em>Minister</em> and do 
       everything reasonably within its power at all times to minimize and 
       reduce the amount of <em>Canada</em>'s obligations under the provisions of 
       this section.

5.     In case of disagreement as to the amount which the Contractor is 
       entitled to be reimbursed, the matter shall be referred to the 
       Federal Court.

6.     Upon reimbursement being made the Contractor as <em>herein</em> provided, 
       title to the materials, parts, plant, <em>equipment</em> and work in process 
       in respect of which such reimbursement is made shall pass to and 
       vest in <em>Canada</em> (the Contractor <em>hereby</em> agreeing to execute and 
       deliver all requisite instruments by way of further assurance) and 
       such materials, parts, plant, <em>equipment</em> and work in process shall be 
       delivered to the order of the <em>Minister</em>, but the materials thus taken 
       over will in no case be in excess of what would have been required 
       for performing the <em>Contract</em> in full if no notice has been given 
       under the provisions <em>hereof</em>.

7.     If it is established to the satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> by the 
       Contractor that by reason of any action taken by the <em>Minister</em> under 
       the provisions of this section exceptional hardship has resulted to 
       the Contractor, then the <em>Minister</em> may, notwithstanding any other 
       provisions of this section, in his absolute discretion grant such 
       allowance (not to include in any case, however, any allowance or 
       compensation for loss of profit) to the Contractor as, in the 
       opinion of the <em>Minister</em>, is warranted by the circumstances.

8.     The Contractor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of any action taken or notice given by the <em>
       Minister</em> under or pursuant to the provisions of this section except 
       as and to the extent in this section expressly provided. 
9.     The right of termination and of giving notice hereinbefore provided
