<pre>Use the following clause where the contractor is to be required to exploit the

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     In consideration of the Contractor receiving title to the Foreground 
       Information, the Contractor agrees that  manufacture of any product 
       incorporating or derived from the Foreground Information will be 
       done substantially in Canada and that the provision of any service 
       incorporating or derived from the Foreground Information will be 
       substantially from a base in Canada, and that such a product or such 
       a service will be marketed and sold within _____ months after final 
       payment under the Contract is made to the Contractor.

2.     The Contractor shall have satisfied the obligation in subsection 1. 
       in relation to any part of the Foreground Information if a product 
       manufactured substantially in Canada or a service provided 
       substantially from a base in Canada that incorporates or is derived 
       from that part of the Foreground Information is being offered for 
       general sale by the Contractor or its transferee, assignee or 
       licensee, and at least one arm's-length sale has been made (other 
       than a sale from a transferee, assignee or licensee to the 
       Contractor).  The minister for whose department or agency the Work 
       is being carried out may accept other evidence as demonstrating 
       satisfaction of the obligation. When the obligation has been 
       satisfied in relation to any part of the Foreground Information, the 
       obligation shall cease to apply to that part of the Foreground 
       Information.

3.     If, ____ months before the end of the period specified in subsection 
       (1), the obligation to market and sell a product or service within 
       the period specifed in subsection 1. has not been satisfied in 
       relation to any part of the Foreground Information, the Contractor 
       shall immediately submit to the minister for whose department or 
       agency the Work is being carried out a report setting out:

       (a)    a description of the efforts that have been and will be made 
              by the Contractor or its transferee, assignee or licensee to 
              satisfy the obligation; and

       (b)    the reasons why the obligation has not been satisfied.

4.     At the expiration of the period specified in subsection 1., if the 
       minister for whose department or agency the Work is being carried 
       out is satisfied that the Foreground Information is capable of 
       commercial exploitation in Canada but that

       (a)    the Contractor (or its transferee, assignee or licensee) is 
              incapable of achieving that; or

       (b)    the Contractor has not made every reasonable effort to fulfil 
              the obligation;

       that minister may invoke either of the remedies set out in 
       subsection (6).  If that minister is satisfied that the potential 
       value to Canada of commercial exploitation of the Foreground 
       Information substantially in Canada so justifies,  that minister may 
       extend the time for the Contractor to fulfil the obligation by such 
       period as that minister may decide.  In any other circumstance, the 
       obligation shall cease to apply to that part of the Foreground 
       Information.

5.     The Contractor agrees that any of the following, affecting any part 
       of the Foreground Information, would constitute a breach of the 
       Contractor's obligation entitling the minister to exercise, in 
       relation to that part of the Foreground Information, the option to 
       collect the liquidated damages provided for in the Contract for such 
       a breach (if any), or, without prejudice to any other remedy that 
       may be available, to exercise a remedy set out in subsection 6.:

       (a)    the Contractor or any affiliate, subcontractor or agent of 
              the Contractor manufactures outside Canada a product 
              incorporating or derived from the Foreground Information 
              without that product also being manufactured substantially in 
              Canada, or provides from a base outside Canada a service 
              incorporating or derived from the Foreground Information 
              without that service also being provided substantially from a 
              base in Canada;

       (b)    through the act or omission, whether direct or indirect, and 
              whether deliberate or negligent, of the Contractor or its 
              employee or subcontractor (including the sale or assignment 
              of the Foreground Information or license or other 
              authorization of the use of the Foreground Information), any 
              person, corporation or other entity is enabled to manufacture 
              outside Canada a product incorporating or derived from the 
              Foreground Information without that product also being 
              manufactured substantially in Canada, or to provide from a 
              base outside Canada a service incorporating or derived from 
              the Foreground Information without that service also being 
              provided substantially from a base in Canada;

       (c)    the Contractor or its transferee or assignee, or a 
              controlling interest in the Contractor or its transferee or 
              assignee, is acquired by a person not resident in Canada or 
              by a corporation or other entity controlled outside of Canada, 
              and that person, corporation or other entity does not enter 
              into an agreement with the minister for whose department or 
              agency the Work was carried out governing the use of the 
              Foreground Information, promptly and before a breach 
              described in paragraph (a) or (b) has occurred; or

       (d)    the Contractor or its transferee or assignee becomes bankrupt 
              or insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of 
              creditors, or takes the benefit of any statute relating to 
              bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or the Contractor, its 
              transferee or assignee suffers the appointment against it of 
              a receiver under a debt instrument or by a court, or an order 
              is made or a resolution passed for the winding up of the 
              Contractor, its transferee or assignee.

6.     Where this subsection applies by virtue of subsection 4. or 5., the 
       minister for whose department or agency the Work is being carried 
       out may, by notice, either

       (a)    require the Contractor to assign or transfer to Canada at no 
              cost title to the Foreground Information, or

       (b)    require the Contractor to provide to one or more persons, 
              corporations or other entities specified by that minister at 
              no cost a non-exclusive, unconditional, irrevocable, 
              worldwide, and royalty-free license permitting the commercial 
              exploitation of the Foreground Information, including the 
              right to further develop the Foreground Information and to 
              own any such further development.

       The Contractor agrees that it will promptly execute such conveyances 
       or other documents relating to title or licensing as the said 
       minister may require, and that it will afford that minister or a 
       licensee, as the case may be, at that party's expense all reasonable 
       assistance in the prosecution of any patent application or 
       registration of a copyright or an industrial design arising out of 
       the Foreground Information.

7.     In the event that a breach described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of 
   subsection (5) occurs, in addition to all other remedies available to 
   Canada, the Contractor shall upon demand account for and pay to Canada 
   any net revenues earned by the Contractor as a result of the breach.
