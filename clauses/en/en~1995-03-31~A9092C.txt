<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>This clause should be used when a proposed contractor has started work with the 
authorization of a government official, prior to contract authorization, and the 
work has not been completed. This will ensure that the work done prior to the 
contract date will be covered by the contract.  If the work has been completed, 
the contracting authority must request that a confirming order be prepared by 
legal counsel. 

The second paragraph is to be deleted if the client department does not wish to 
retain the rights to the intellectual property.  In addition, add clause C0210C 
to the Basis of Payment.
