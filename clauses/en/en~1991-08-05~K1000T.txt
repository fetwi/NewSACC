<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Bidder represents and warrants that the Statement of Eligible Goods 
attached to this bid is accurate and complete and satisfies the definition 
of eligible goods set out in that statement.  

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation 
and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any contract resulting from 
this bid.  Such representation and warranty may be verified in such manner 
as the Minister may reasonably require.

Eligible goods, products of Canadian origin, and designated products from 
rationalized multinational companies (reference SSC policy, SPM Directive 
3051) will be given preference by increasing the bid price for all other 
goods by a factor of 10 percent for evaluation purposes.  The 10 percent 
factor will also be applied to those products not identified in, or in bids 
submitted without, the Statement of Eligible Goods.
