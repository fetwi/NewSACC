should so state in his proposal. Any deviations from the stipulated 
conditions should be given in detail with an explanation as to why they are 
being proposed. The Contracting Authority reserves the right to accept any 
proposal as submitted without prior negotiations. It is the responsibility 
of the Proposer to obtain clarification of the requirements contained
