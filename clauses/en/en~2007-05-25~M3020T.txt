requirements, where specific individuals will be proposed for the work.  Use in 
conjunction with M3020C.

If the template 2T-RFSO1 is used, insert this clause, if applicable, under

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Offeror certifies that, should it be issued a standing offer as a 
result of the Request for Standing Offer, every individual proposed in its 
offer will be available to perform the Work resulting from a call-up 
against the Standing Offer as required by Canada's representatives and at 
the time specified in a call-up or agreed to with Canada's representatives.  
If for reasons beyond its control, the Offeror is unable to provide the 
services of an individual named in its offer, the Offeror may propose a 
substitute with similar qualifications and experience.  The Offeror must 
advise the Standing Offer Authority of the reason for the substitution and 
provide the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed replacement.  
For the purposes of this clause, only the following reasons will be 
considered as beyond the control of the Offeror: death, sickness, 
retirement, resignation, dismissal for cause or termination of an agreement 
for default.

If the Offeror has proposed any individual who is not an employee of the 
   Offeror, the Offeror certifies that it has the permission from that 
   individual to propose his/her services in relation to the Work to be 
   performed and to submit his/her résumé to Canada.  The Offeror must, 
   upon request from the Standing Offer Authority, provide a written 
   confirmation, signed by the individual, of the permission given to the 
   Offeror and of his/her availability.  Failure to comply with the request 
   may result in the offer being declared non-responsive.
