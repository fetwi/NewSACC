<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in bid solicitations which are estimated at $200,000 or 
more (including all applicable taxes), except requirements excluded under 
paragraphs 5.129 (d), (e) and (f) of the Supply Manual.  (Refer also to

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) 
       requires that some organizations bidding for federal government 
       contracts, valued at $200,000 or more (including all applicable 
       taxes), make a formal commitment to implement employment equity, as 
       a condition precedent to the contract award.  If the bidder is 
       subject to the Program, evidence of its commitment must be provided 
       prior to the award of any contract.

<strong>       </strong>Contractors that have been declared "Ineligible Contractors" by 
       Human Resources Development Canada-Labour (HRDC-Labour) are no 
       longer eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold 
       for solicitation of bids as set out in the <em>Government Contract 
       Regulations</em> (currently at $25,000, including all applicable taxes), 
       either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRDC-Labour, or 
       following their voluntary withdrawal from the Program for a reason 
       other than the reduction in their workforce.  Any bid from 
       ineligible contractors will not be considered for award.

2.     The Bidder certifies its status with FCP-EE, as follows:

       The Bidder 

       (a)    (    )        is not subject to FCP-EE, having a workforce of 
                            less than 100 permanent full or part-time 
                            employees in Canada,

       (b)    (    )        is not subject to FCP-EE, being a regulated 
                            employer under the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>;

       (c)    (    )        is subject to the requirements of FCP-EE, 
                            having a workforce of 100 or more permanent 
                            full or part-time employees in Canada, but has 
                            not previously obtained a certificate number 
                            from HRDC-Labour, (having not bid on 
                            requirements of $200,000 or more), in which 
                            case a duly signed certificate of commitment is 
                            provided herewith (attached);

       (d)    (    )        is subject to FCP-EE, and has a valid 
                            certification number as follows: _______ (e.g. 
                            has not been declared "Ineligible Contractor" 
                            by HRDC-Labour).

3.     If the Bidder does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 2. (
       a) or (b), the Program requirements do apply, and as such, the 
       Bidder is required to submit HRDC-Labour form LAB 1186, Certificate 
       of Commitment to Implement Employment Equity, DULY SIGNED or a valid 
       Certificate number confirming its adherence to the FCP-EE.

4.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister shall rely on this 
       certification to award the Contract.  Should a verification by the 
       Minister disclose a misrepresentation on the part of the Bidder, the 
       Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting from 
       this bid as being in default, and to terminate it pursuant to the 
       Default provisions of the Contract.

5.     In all cases, the Bidder is required to produce evidence or 
       supporting information on demand prior to contract award, if such 
       evidence is not included with its bid.

       Signature of authorized representative:  _________________.
