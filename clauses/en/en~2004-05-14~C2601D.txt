<pre>Use the following clause in bid solicitations and contracts for defence supplies

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     As the goods to be supplied under the Contract are defence supplies, 
       customs duties on importation to Canada may be remitted under the 
       Tariff Item Number 9982.00.00 of the Schedule to the Customs Tariff.

2.     Remission of customs duty payable may be granted under the Tariff 
       Item Number 9982.00.00 when the total contract value of the defence 
       supplies is C$250,000 or more.  This reflects the import value of 
       the goods plus the duty that would be applicable in the absence of 
       the Customs Tariff.

3.     The Contractor will be responsible for pre-arranging remission on 
       importation or for paying customs duties on importation and applying 
       to Canada Border Services Agency for a refund.  The importer is 
       responsible for applying to Public Works and Government Services 
       Canada in good time for the certification required by the Customs 
       Tariff.
