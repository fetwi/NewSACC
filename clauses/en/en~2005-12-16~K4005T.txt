<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in which the 
Canadian Content Policy is applicable (see Supply Manual) and where competition 
is being conditionally limited to bids offering Canadian goods and/or services.  
This clause is to be used for multi-item requirements that are being certified 
on an individual item basis and where the bidder will be required to indicate 
beside each item, listed in the bid, whether the item is Canadian.

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K4000D.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is subject to a preference for Canadian goods and/
       or services as defined in clause K4000D.

2.     On an item-by-item basis, items that include this representation and 
       warranty will be given preference over other bids, if there are 
       three or more suppliers who have submitted bids with a valid 
       certification.  Bids may be accepted in whole or in part.

3.     The Bidder represents and warrants that, of the goods and/or 
       services being offered, items individually identified as such in the 
       bid are Canadian goods and/or services as defined in clause K4000D, 
       and acknowledges that only those items will receive consideration.

4.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this bid.  Such representation and warranty 
       of Canadian content may be verified in such manner as the Minister 
       may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       covenant, the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract 
       resulting from this bid as being in default.

6.     Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph and to include it with 
       the bid will result in all goods and/or services offered being 
       treated as non-Canadian.
