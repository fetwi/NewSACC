<strong>06/91</strong>

In the event that you should admit in writing your inability to pay your 
debts as they become due, or should file a petition in bankruptcy, or in 
the event that a petition in bankruptcy should be filed against you and you 
should be adjudicated a bankrupt, or that you should have a receiver or 
trustee appointed, either in voluntary or involuntary proceedings, or that 
you should make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, we reserve the 
right, without prejudice to our right to damages, to consider this contract 
as breached and terminated ipso facto upon such event, with respect to any 
or all supplies not delivered prior to such termination and to recover any 
amounts theretofore paid on account thereof. 

<strong>1011A  10     Warranties</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

specifications, drawings, or samples, if any, and free from defects in 
material and workmanship under proper assembly, use and maintenance. You

twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, become defective as a result 
of faulty material or workmanship.

You warrant that all supplies furnished hereunder (and the normal use 
thereof) are and shall be free and clear of infringement of any United 
States or Canadian patent, copyright or trademark and that you will, at 
your own expense, defend, if required by Her Majesty, any and all actions 
and suits charging such infringement and will save us harmless from any 
loss, damage or expense whatsoever, including attorneys' fees, in case any 
suit, action or claim is commenced or made alleging any such infringement. 
If any suit, action or claim alleging such infringement is commenced or 
made, we reserve the right to cancel this contract and return to you all 
supplies delivered to us under the contract and to recover the amount or an 
equitable portion of the amount, theretofore paid on account of such 
supplies. We agree to indemnify you against any such loss, damage or 
expense resulting from any such infringement or alleged infringement in 
respect of any article or parts thereof supplied to us under this contract 
the design of which shall have been supplied by us, but this indemnity 
shall apply to this contract only.

You warrant that you have not made and will not make any gift to any person 
in connection with the solicitation or performance of this contract. Any 
breach of this warranty shall entitle us to cancel this contract and to 
recover from you the amount of any loss resulting from such cancellation.

securing business.  Breach of this warranty shall entitle us to cancel this 
contract as to any supplies not delivered and paid for at the time of the 
discovery of such breach and to recover any amounts theretofore paid on 
account thereof, or in the alternative, to deduct from the purchase price 
of the supplies covered hereby the amount of any such commission, 
percentage, brokerage or contingent fee or to recover such amount as 
liquidated damages.

States Government on similar supplies. 

<strong>1011A  11     Delayed Deliveries</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

Time is of the essence of this contract.

If you should fail or refuse to make deliveries on the dates herein 
specified, as such dates may be extended by any cause of excusable delay, 
we may, at our option, terminate this contract as to any supplies not then 
delivered hereunder and recover any amounts theretofore paid on account 
thereof and may purchase other supplies of a similar description charging 
you with any excess cost incurred by us by reason of such purchase.

Excusable delay as used herein shall mean any delay caused by force majeure, 
act of God and by any other events independent of your will and beyond your 
control. Any excusable delay shall extend the delivery dates set forth 
herein by the amount of such excusable delay but shall not relieve you of 
your obligation to make any such deliveries so delayed.

<strong>06/91</strong>

<strong>1011A  13     Security and Protection of Work</strong>
<strong>04/92</strong>

You agree to keep confidential and to use every reasonable endeavour to 
prevent any publicity concerning the existence of this contract.

If the contract or the drawings, specifications or information issued, used 
or disclosed in connection with the contract are classified as to the 
degree of precaution necessary for their safeguarding, you shall safeguard 
the same in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States 
of America pertaining to such classification.

If any drawings, specifications or information are issued by us in 
connection herewith, the same are confidential and shall not be disclosed 
to any person other than your company or firm without previous written 
consent from the Government of Canada, nor shall they be used by any person 
for any purpose other than that for which the said drawings, specifications 
or information were provided. All drawings and specifications and all

terminated.  

<strong>1011A  14     Sabotage</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

You agree to take all reasonable measures to protect from sabotage the

act of sabotage has been committed. 

<strong>1011A  15     Arbitration</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

All questions and controversies arising in connection with this contract 
shall be submitted to arbitration, in accordance with the rules of 
arbitration of the American Arbitration Association.


 
<strong>1011A  16     Price Control</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

You certify that the contract price of the supplies is not in excess of any 
applicable maximum price established under any statute, regulation or order 
to which you are subject and you agree that if, at any time, the contract 
price is in excess of such a maximum price, then the contract price shall 
be automatically reduced to the extent required, and you will make any 
necessary refunds to us. 

<strong>1011A  17     Taxes</strong>

Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the prices herein include no 
amount for any federal excise tax, state or local sales or use tax, or any 
other tax of a similar nature, or any Canadian tax whatsoever. Such prices, 
however, include all other taxes. If the supplies are normally subject to 
federal excise tax, we will, upon request, furnish you with a certificate 
of exemption from such federal excise tax in the form prescribed by the 
Federal Regulations. We undertake to supply you with such evidence of 
export as may, from time to time, be properly requested by the tax 
authorities.  If, as a result of our failure to do so, you are compelled to 
pay such federal excise tax, we shall reimburse you therefor, provided, 
however, that you will thereafter take such steps as we may require in an 
effort to recover such payment, and shall refund to us any amount so 
recovered.  

<strong>1011A  18     Termination</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

We shall have the right to terminate this contract at any time by giving 
you notice to that effect by registered mail.  In that event, all supplies 
completed and ready for delivery when said notice is received by you will 
be duly purchased and paid for by us as set forth in this contract. As to 
all supplies not so completed and ready for delivery, we shall have the 
option (with respect to all or any part thereof) of requiring their 
completion and of taking delivery thereof, paying the full contract price 
therefor, or of paying you, in full settlement of all our obligations with 
respect thereto, a sum equal to the cost actually incurred by you in 
connection with the manufacture of such supplies to the date of termination 
and, in addition, an amount representing a fair and reasonable profit in 
respect of the work done thereon, less any advance payment previously made 
by us with respect thereto, and less the salvage value of any supplies 
remaining unfinished.  The amount of such cost will be determined from your 
books of account in accordance with good accounting practice.

Whenever practicable, you shall procure materials and/or parts required for 
the performance of this contract on terms that will enable you to terminate 
any contracts entered into by you therefor upon terms similar to those 
herein provided for in respect of the termination of this contract by us 
and you will co-operate with us and do everything reasonably within your 
power at all times to minimize and reduce the amount of our obligations 
under the provisions of this section 18. 

<strong>1011A  19     Accounts</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

You shall, during the performance of the contract, keep proper books, 
accounts and records of the cost to you of the work and of all expenditures 
and commitments made by you in connection therewith and the invoices, 
receipts and vouchers relating thereto.  If the price provided for in the 
contract is other than a firm fixed price, or in the event of termination 
of all or part of the work, you shall, unless otherwise agreed to by us, 
cause all such books, accounts, records, invoices, receipts and vouchers as 
aforesaid to be preserved and kept available for audit and inspection by 
our authorized representatives at any time until the expiration of six (6) 
years from the end of the calendar year in which the contract is terminated 
or completed, and shall afford all facilities for such audits and 
inspection and shall furnish our authorized representatives with such 
information as they may from time to time require with reference thereto.
