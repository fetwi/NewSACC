<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Suppliers who are subject to the Federal Contractors Program for Employment 
Equity (FCP-EE) and have been declared ineligible contractors by Human 
Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer eligible to 
receive federal government contracts over the threshold for solicitation of 
bids as set out in the Government Contract Regulations. Suppliers may be 
declared ineligible contractors either as a result of a finding of 
non-compliance by HRSDC, or following their voluntary withdrawal from the 
FCP-EE for a reason other than the reduction of their workforce.  Any bids 
from ineligible contractors will be declared non-responsive. 

The Bidder certifies that it has not been declared an ineligible contractor 
by HRSDC.
