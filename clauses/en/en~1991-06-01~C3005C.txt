in form DSS-MAS 9411, Claim for Exchange Rates Adjustments, which forms 
part of this Contract.

2.  The foreign currency component is defined as the element of the price 
which will be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.  It excludes Canadian 
goods and services tax and excise taxes of an ad valorem nature on imported 
items and customs duty, but includes transportation costs payable in 
foreign currency.

3.  The foreign currency component(s) subject to adjustment in respect of

currency, and the applicable conversion factors are as detailed in form

4.  Price adjustments in respect of changes in currency relationships after

upon the foreign currency component(s) as identified in form DSS-MAS 9411.  
Price adjustments will be computed according to the increase or decrease in 
the foreign exchange rate(s) from the rate(s) specified in the form.  Such 
increases or decreases in the rate shall be based on the dates of payment 
to the Contractor by Canada.

5.  The amount of the adjustment so payable shall be the sum of: a) the 
portion of the stated foreign currency component from form DSS-MAS 9411, 
included in the first progress claim, multiplied by the difference between 
the actual rate for foreign currency and the rate for foreign currency 
stated in the Contract (see section B of form DSS-MAS 9411); and b) any 
further amounts calculated in a similar fashion on each subsequent progress 
claim, subject to the provision that such calculation will terminate as 
soon as the full amount of the stated foreign currency component as shown 
at section C of the form has been reached.

6.  On each progress claim submitted, the Contractor shall show the portion 
   of the stated foreign currency component in foreign funds included in 
   the claim.  If the progress claim, in whole or in part, relates to goods 
   already cleared through customs into Canada and not previously claimed 
   on progress claims, the Contractor shall show the dates that the goods 
   where shipped for clearance through customs, supported by a copy of the 
   relevant shipping document.
