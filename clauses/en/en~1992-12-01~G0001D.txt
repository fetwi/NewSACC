<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS; Commercial General Liability Insurance shall be 
effected and maintained in force, in an amount usual for a contract of this 
nature, but, in any case, for not less than $1,000,000, jointly in the name 
of the Contractor and in the name of Canada, and must include the 
applicable portion of the insurance premium in the Contract Price. The 
policies must provide that, if Canada sustains loss from a risk insured 
against under the policies in circumstances which give Canada cause of 
action against the Contractor, the policies shall protect Canada in the 
same manner as they would any other claimant.

a)     JOINT INSURED:   The insurance policy will be made out in the names 
       of the Contractor and Canada as their respective rights and 
       interests may appear.

b)     LITIGATION RIGHTS:   It is understood and agreed that where any suit 
       is instituted for or against Canada which the insurer, or insurers 
       would, but for this clause, have the right to pursue or defend on 
       behalf of Canada as joint named insured under this Contract for 
       insurance, the insurer, or insurers shall promptly request 
       instructions from the Attorney General of Canada by sending a 
       registered letter to the Director, Civil Litigation, Department of 
       Justice, Kent and Wellington Streets, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0H8.  This 
       request should be followed by an information copy to the Contracting 
       Authority.

c)     CROSS LIABILITY:  Any act or omission on the part of one or another 
       of the Insured hereunder shall not prejudice the rights or interests 
       of any other Insured.  This policy, subject to its limits of 
       liability, shall apply to each Insured in the same manner and to the 
       same extent as if a separate policy had been issued to each.  The 
       inclusion herein of more than one insured shall not operate to 
       increase the limits of the insurers' liability.

d)     EVIDENCE OF INSURANCE:  After award of the Contract, the Contractor 
   will forward to the Minister, a certified true copy of either the 
   Insurance Certificate with relevant clauses attached or the Insurance 
   Policy issued by the insurer(s) as evidence that the required insurance 
   has been effected.
