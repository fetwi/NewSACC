       following arrangements:

       (a)    Percentage Fee

              The calculation of the total basic fee recognizes the 
              variability of the <em>Construction Cost Estimate</em> as the Project 
              develops.  The basic fee for the various <em>Services</em> of the 
              Project development shall be calculated on the basis of the 
              following formula:

              An amount equal to <em>F x A</em>
              Where <em>F</em> = the percentage specified in clause R2001D, 
              Agreement Particulars , and <em>A</em> = as follows:

              (1)    At Analysis of <em>Project Brief</em> and Design Concept: 
                     <em>A </em>= the <em>Construction Cost Estimate</em> at the time of

              (2)    At Design Development:
                     <em>A</em> = the accepted preliminary <em>Construction Cost 
                     Estimate</em> prepared on completion of the design concept 
                     documents.

              (3)    At Construction Documents:
                     <em>A</em> = the accepted updated <em>Construction Cost Estimate</em> 
                     prepared on completion of the design development 
                     documents.

              (4)    At Tender Call and Tender Evaluation:
                     <em>A</em> = the accepted final <em>Construction Cost Estimate</em> 
                     prepared on completion of the construction documents.
