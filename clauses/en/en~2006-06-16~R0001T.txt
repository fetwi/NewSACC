       (b)    the Tenderer's bidding privileges are suspended or are in the 
              process of being suspended;

       (c)    the bidding privileges of any employee or subcontractor 
              included as part of the Tender have been suspended or are in 
              the process of being suspended, which suspension or pending 
              suspension would render that employee or subcontractor 
              ineligible to bid on the Work, or the portion of the Work the 
              employee or subcontractor is to perform;

       (d)    with respect to current or prior transactions with the 
              Government of Canada

              (i)    the Tenderer is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, 
                     its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended 
                     period;

              (ii)   evidence, satisfactory to Her Majesty, of fraud, 
                     bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to 
                     comply with any law protecting individuals against any 
                     manner of discrimination, has been received with 
                     respect to the Tenderer, any of its employees or any 
                     subcontractor included as part of its Tender;

              (iii)  the Minister has previously exercised or intends to 
                     exercise the contractual remedy of taking the work out 
                     of the contractor's hands with respect to a Contract 
                     with the Tenderer, any of its employees or any 
                     subcontractor included as part of its Tender; or

              (iv)   Her Majesty determines that the Tenderer's performance 
                     on other contracts, including the efficiency and 
                     workmanship as well as the extent to which the 
                     Tenderer executed the work in accordance with 
                     contractual terms and conditions, is sufficiently poor 
                     to jeopardize the successful completion of the  
                     requirement being bid on.

5.     Where Her Majesty intends to reject a Tender pursuant to a provision 
       of subsection 13.4, other than paragraph 13.4(b), the Minister will 
       so inform the Tenderer and provide the Tenderer ten (10) days within 
       which to make representations, prior to making a final decision on 
       the Tender rejection.
