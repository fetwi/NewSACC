receipt of a pension.

(b)	the application of $5,000 limit of the fee policy when the successful bidder 
is a former public servant in receipt of a lump sum payment pursuant to a work

complexity (2T-HIGH1) template is not used.  Contracting officers must consult 
the procedures 2T-PROC1 to confirm they cannot use the template for the 
requirement.

"The following certification should be submitted with the bid, but may be 
completed and submitted afterwards. If the required certification is not 
completed or submitted as requested, the Contracting Authority will so inform 
the Bidder and provide the Bidder with a time frame within which to meet the 
requirement. Failure to comply with the request of the Contracting Authority and 
meet the requirement within that time period will render the bid non-responsive.
