This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K4000D, Canadian Content 
Definition.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is subject to a preference for Canadian Goods and/
       or Services as defined in clause K4000D, Canadian Content Definition.

2.     Bids that include this representation and warranty will be given 
       preference over other bids, if there are three or more bids with a 
       valid certification.

3.     By executing this representation and warranty, the Bidder Represents 
       and warrants that, of the goods and/or services being offered, no 
       less than 80 percent of the bid price consists of Canadian Goods and
       /or Services, as defined in the clause K4000D, Canadian Content 
       Definition.

4.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this bid.  Such representation and warranty 
       of Canadian content may be verified in such manner as the Minister 
       may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       covenant, the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract 
       resulting from this bid as being in default.

       Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph and to include it with 
       the bid will result in the Goods and/or Services offered being 
       treated as non-Canadian.
