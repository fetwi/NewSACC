       issue date of the solicitation up to the closing date, are to be 
       directed ONLY to the individual named on page one (1) of the bid 
       solicitation.  Enquiries and other communications are NOT to be 
       directed to any other government official(s).  Failure to comply 
       with this paragraph 1 can (for that reason alone) result in the 
       disqualification of the bid.

2.     Enquiries must be IN WRITING.

3.     Enquiries must be received no less than _____ calendar days prior to 
       the bid closing date to allow sufficient time to provide a response.  
       Enquiries received after that time might not be answered prior to 
       the bid closing date.

4.     To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to bidders 
       with respect to significant enquiries received, and the replies to 
       such enquiries, any information will be provided simultaneously to 
       bidders to which this solicitation has been sent, without revealing 
       the sources of the enquiries.
