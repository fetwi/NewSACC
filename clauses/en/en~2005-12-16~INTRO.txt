Under the authority of the <em>Department of Public Works and Government 
Services Act</em>:

       "21.(1) The Minister may fix terms and conditions of contracts, and 
       instructions and terms and conditions with respect to other 
       documents relating to contracts and their formation.

       Designation (2) The terms and conditions and instructions may be 
       identified by number or other designation and may be incorporated in 
       a contract or other document by reference to their number or other 
       designation.

       Publication (3) The Minister may, by regulation, prescribe the 
       electronic or other means by which a term, condition or instruction, 
       including its identification number or other designation, shall be 
       published."

<strong>DISTRIBUTION</strong>

The <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions </em>(SACC) Manual is produced 
in two electronic versions -  HTML and PDF.  Both versions contain 
information on current clauses and conditions as well as instructions on 
how these clauses and conditions are used.  They also provide the reader 
with the complete text of previous general conditions, supplemental general 
conditions and/or clause found in the Manual, that have been either 
cancelled or superseded.

<strong>STRUCTURE</strong>

The Manual has been organized to follow the progression of information 
presented in procurement documents:

<strong>Section 1 - Standard Instructions and Conditions</strong>

Previously printed on the reverse of page 1 of solicitations and contracts, 
or included as attachments, these instructions and conditions are now 
identified in standard clause A0000T, located at the beginning of the 
clause section in procurement documents.

<strong>Section 2 - Templates and Forms</strong>

<strong>Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement Templates for Goods and 
Services</strong>

This section provides templates for Low Dollar Value and Medium Complexity 
requirements as well as the procedures for their use.

The development of the Plain Language Standard Procurement documents is an 
on-going initiative whose objectives are to standardize procurement 
terminology, simplify the language, and ensure more consistency and 
uniformity in acquisition documents issued by the Department.

<strong>Forms</strong>

This section contains a listing of PWGSC forms available on PWGSC Website 
and which are commonly used in the procurement process, such as PWGSC-TPSGC 
1111, Claim for Progress Payment, and PWGSC-TPSGC 9411, Claim for Exchange 
Rate Adjustments.  A number of forms commonly-used in real property 
contracting are also included.

<strong>Sections 3 and 4 - General Conditions and Supplemental General Conditions</strong>

1.     These sections present those sets of standard conditions which form 
       the foundation upon which all procurement documents issued by PWGSC 
       are built.

       (a)    Section 3, General Conditions, defines the basic sets of 
              conditions which apply to specific classes of contracts (e.g. 
              9601, General Conditions - Long Form).

       (b)    Section 4, Supplemental General Conditions, addresses areas 
              unique to specific subclasses of contracts (e.g. 1028, Ship 
              Construction - Firm Price).

2.     Each section/article within a condition set has been given its own 
       effective date.  The condition set as a whole has also been given an 
       effective date which is reflected in section 00 and is determined by 
       the latest revision date of one or more of its sections.

<strong>Section 5 - Standard Procurement Clauses</strong>

1.     This section contains a collection of national procurement clauses, 
       common to various classes of contracts.  The full text of individual 
       clauses, incorporated by reference into a bid solicitation or 
       contract by their Number, Title and Effective Date, can be found in 
       this section of the Manual.  Each subsection (A-Z) is devoted to a 
       particular subject area.  Please note that some subsections have not 
       been assigned at this time.

2.     Clauses may be identified by their numbers which break down as 
       follows:

       (a)    the first alphabetic character (A-Z) indicates the subsection 
              in Section 5;

       (b)    the four numeric characters (0000-9999) indicate the clause's 
              position within the numeric sequence of the subsection;

       (c)    the final alphabetic character (T, C or D) indicates the type 
              of document in which a given clause would be used (i.e. T = 
              Tender; C = Contract; D = Dual purpose, used in both tenders 
              and contracts).

Example:      Clause C0004T - Price Certification.  This is the fourth 
              sequential clause found in subsection C - Price, of Section 5 
              and is used in Tender (solicitation) documents.

<strong>USE OF THE MANUAL</strong>

<strong>1.     Incorporation by Reference clauses (R)</strong>
Bid solicitations and contracts will contain references to specific clauses 
and general conditions which will apply to that particular requirement. 
Clause references will include the clause number, its effective date and 
its title (e.g. B1504D (16/02/98) State of Charge).  All clauses referred 
to in this manner can be found in Section 5 of this Manual.

<strong>2.     Fill-in clauses (F)</strong>
Clauses which require the insertion of specific information by the 
contracting officer or the supplier (fill-in clauses) will be produced in 
full on procurement documents.

<strong>NOTE</strong>:  In the case of discrepancies in clause versions between solicitation 
              documents and the Manual, any clause appearing in full text 
              in a procurement document will override any version set out 
              in the Manual.

<strong>3.     Updates</strong>

Any standard clause, and any condition or instruction set, used or 
referenced in a bid solicitation or contract may be updated from time to 
time.  When this happens, the version used in an already-issued document 
will remain in effect in that document, unless the updated version is 
legally incorporated.
