all contracts between <abbr title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> and a Contractor for Work that the
following specific business opportunities for the provision of
goods and services associated with the Work shall be provided
through the Contractor or Subcontractors as set out in the
subclause hereunder. The Contractor will provide the companies,
listed below, a length of time to prepare a bid which take into
consideration the size and complexity of the work being solicited.
In any event, not less than fifteen (15) calendar days shall be
provided for a bid response from the date the solicitation
documents are delivered. Where, following a solicitation for one of
the services set out in this clause, the corresponding Inuvialuit
Business has submitted a bid that is technically compliant,
competitive and based on the lower of published tariffs (where
applicable) or most favoured customer rates (where applicable), and
the Contractor decides to execute a contract for that Work, the
contract shall be offered to that Inuvialuit Business. If it has
been determined that a bid response contains minor variances which
cause it to be considered not technically compliant or not
competitive, the company which submitted the bid will be provided
an opportunity to clarify the scope of work and revise its bid
accordingly (if required).
