<h2 id="2016-04-042006general-information">General information
  </h2><p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period. Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The process normally starts with a Request for Standing Offers
    (RFSO) that suppliers may obtain through the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> is an invitation to suppliers to provide <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with a standing offer. The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated expenditure specified in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> are only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods, services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2 id="2016-04-042006integrity-provisions">01 (2016-04-04) Integrity Provisions—offer</h2>
<ol>
<li>The <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em> (the “Policy”) in effect on the date the Request for Standing Offers (RFSO) is issued, and all related Directives in effect on that date, are incorporated by reference into, and form a binding part of the RFSO. The Offeror must comply with the Policy and Directives, which can be found at <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em>. </li>
<li>Under the Policy, charges and convictions of certain offences against a Supplier, its affiliates or first tier subcontractors, and other circumstances, will or may result in a determination by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) that the Supplier is ineligible to be issued or is suspended from being issued a standing offer and to enter into a contract with Canada. The list of ineligible and suspended Suppliers is contained in <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Integrity Database. The Policy describes how enquiries can be made regarding the ineligibility or suspension of Suppliers.</li>
<li>In addition to all other information required in the Request for Standing Offers, the Offeror must provide the following:
      <ol type="a">
<li>by the time stated in the Policy, all information required by the Policy described under the heading  “Information to be Provided when Bidding, Contracting or Entering into a Real Property Agreement”; and</li>
<li>with its offer, a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy. The list of foreign criminal charges and convictions must be submitted using an Integrity Declaration Form, which can be found at Declaration form for procurement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Subject to subsection 5, by submitting an offer in response to this Request for Standing Offers, the Offeror certifies that:
      <ol type="a">
<li>it has read and understands the <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em>;</li>
<li>it understands that certain domestic and foreign criminal charges and convictions, and other circumstances, as described in the Policy, will or may result in a determination of ineligibility or suspension under the Policy;</li>
<li>it is aware that Canada may request additional information, certifications, and validations from the Offeror or a third party for purposes of making a determination of ineligibility or suspension;</li>
<li>it has provided with its offer a complete list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to itself, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences in the Policy;</li>
<li>none of the domestic criminal offences, and other circumstances, described in the Policy that will or may result in a determination of ineligibility or suspension, apply to it, its affiliates and its proposed first tier subcontractors; and</li>
<li>it is not aware of a determination of ineligibility or suspension issued by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> that applies to it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Where an Offeror is unable to provide any of the certifications required by subsection 4, it must submit with its offer a completed Integrity Declaration Form, which can be found at Declaration form for procurement.</li>
<li>Canada will declare non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information requested is incomplete or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in a certification or declaration is found by Canada to be false or misleading in any respect. If Canada establishes after issuance of the Standing Offer that the Offeror provided a false or misleading certification or declaration, Canada may set aside the Standing Offer and terminate for default any resulting contracts. Pursuant to the Policy, Canada may also determine the Offeror to be ineligible for issuance of a standing offer for providing a false or misleading certification or declaration.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2016-04-042006procurement-business-number">02 (2012-03-02) Procurement Business Number</h2>
<p>Suppliers are required to have a Procurement Business Number (PBN) before issuance of a standing offer. Suppliers may register for a <abbr title="Procurement Business Number">PBN</abbr> on line at Supplier Registration Information. For non-Internet registration, suppliers may contact the InfoLine at 1-800-811-1148 to obtain the telephone number of the nearest Supplier Registration Agent.</p>

<li>provide a comprehensible and sufficiently detailed offer, including all requested pricing details, that will permit a complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Canada will make available Notices of Proposed Procurement (NPP), <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>'s and related documents for download through the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). Canada is not responsible and will not assume any liabilities whatsoever for the information found on websites of third parties. In the event an <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr>, <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> or related documentation would be amended, Canada will not be sending notifications. Canada will post all amendments, including significant enquirires received and their replies, using <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>.

<li>Offers will remain open for acceptance for a period of not less than 60 days from the closing date of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> , unless specified otherwise in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>. Canada reserves the right to seek an extension of the offer validity period from all responsive offerors in writing, within a minimum of 3 days before the end of the offer validity period. If the extension is accepted by all responsive offerors, Canada will continue with the evaluation of the offers. If the extension is not accepted by all responsive offerors, Canada will, at its sole discretion, either continue with the evaluation of the offers of those who have accepted the extension or cancel the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>.</li>

<ol>
<li>An offer delivered to the specified Bid Receiving Unit after the closing date and time but before the standing offer issuance date may be considered, provided the offeror can prove the delay is due solely to a delay in delivery that can be attributed to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a foreign country). Purolator <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> is not considered to be part of <abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> for the purposes of delayed offers. The only pieces of evidence relating to a delay in the <abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> system that are acceptable to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> are:
      <ol type="a">

<li>the Offeror is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li>evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has been received with respect to the Offeror, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of the offer;</li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Where Canada intends to reject an offer pursuant to a provision of subsection 1. (f), the Standing Offer Authority will so inform the Offeror and provide the Offeror 10 days within which to make representations, before making a final decision on the offer rejection.</li>
<li>Canada reserves the right to apply additional scrutiny, in particular, when multiple offers are received in response to a request for standing offers from a single offeror or a joint venture. Canada reserves the right to:
      <ol type="a">
<li>reject any or all of the offers submitted by a single offeror or joint venture if their inclusion in the evaluation has the effect of prejudicing the integrity and fairness of the process, or;</li>
<li>reject any or all of the offers submitted by a single offeror or joint venture if their inclusion in the procurement process would distort the solicitation evaluation, and would cause a result that would not reasonably have been expected under prevailing market conditions and/or would not provide good value to Canada.</li>

<li>correct any error in the extended pricing of offers by using unit pricing and any error in quantities in offers to reflect the quantities stated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>; in the case of error in the extension of prices, the unit price will govern.</li>
<li>verify any information provided by offerors through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties;</li>
<li>interview, at the sole costs of offerors, any offeror and/or any or all of the resources proposed by offerors to fulfill the requirement of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Offerors will have the number of days specified in the request by the Standing Offer Authority to comply with any request related to any of the above items. Failure to comply with the request may result in the offer being declared non-responsive.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2016-04-042006joint-venture">17 (2007-11-30) Joint venture</h2>
<ol>
<li>A joint venture is an association of two or more parties who combine their money, property, knowledge, expertise or other resources in a single joint business enterprise, sometimes referred as a consortium, to submit an offer together on a requirement. Offerors who submit an offer as a joint venture must indicate clearly that it is a joint venture and provide the following information:

<li>the name of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li>the Procurement Business Number of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li>the name of the representative of the joint venture, <abbr title="That is">i.e.</abbr> the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf, if applicable;</li>
<li>the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the information is not clearly provided in the offer, the Offeror must provide the information on request from the Standing Offer Authority.</li>
<li>The offer and any resulting standing offer must be signed by all the members of the joint venture unless one member has been appointed to act on behalf of all members of the joint venture. The Standing Offer Authority may, at any time, require each member of the joint venture to confirm that the representative has been appointed with full authority to act as its representative for the purposes of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any resulting standing offer. If a standing offer is issued to a joint venture, all members of the joint venture will be jointly and severally or solidarily liable for the performance of any contract resulting from a call-up against the standing offer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2016-04-042006conflict-of-interest">18 (2012-03-02) Conflict of interest—unfair advantage</h2>

<li>In order to protect the integrity of the procurement process, offerors are advised that Canada may reject an offer in the following circumstances:
      <ol type="a">
<li>if the Offeror, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees was involved in any manner in the preparation of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> or in any situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li>if the Offeror, any of its subcontractors, any of their respective employees or former employees had access to information related to the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> that was not available to other offerors and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to give the Offeror an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The experience acquired by an offeror who is providing or has provided the goods and services described in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating a conflict of interest. This offeror remains however subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li>Where Canada intends to reject an offer under this section, the Standing Offer Authority will inform the Offeror and provide the Offeror an opportunity to make representations before making a final decision. Offerors who are in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Standing Offer Authority before the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> closing. By submitting an offer, the Offeror represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Offeror acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
