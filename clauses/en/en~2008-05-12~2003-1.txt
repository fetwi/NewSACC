<h3 id="2008-05-122003-1regulatory-framework">01 Regulatory Framework</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada recognizes that bidders may be subject to
regulation by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission (CRTC) in respect of some or all of the services or
products required under the bid solicitation. As a result, the
Bidder may:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">be subject to regulation by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>, but not require
 <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> tariff approval to provide the services or products it
proposes to Canada in its bid;</li>
<li value="2">be subject to regulation by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> and propose
services or products to Canada in its bid in accordance with an
existing tariff that has already been approved by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>; or</li>
<li value="3">be subject to regulation by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> and propose
services or products to Canada in its bid in accordance with a new
tariff (or an amendment to an existing tariff) that has not yet
been approved by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Despite the fact that individual bidders may be
regulated differently by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>, or that individual bidders'
existing tariffs may be inconsistent with Canada's requirements,
all bids will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation
process described in the bid solicitation.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2008-05-122003-1bidders-responsibilities">02 Bidders' Responsibilities in Relation to Regulatory
Framework</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">It is the sole responsibility of the Bidder to:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">identify any <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> regulations or rulings to which it
may be subject in relation to the bid solicitation and any
resulting contract;</li>
<li value="2">obtain all approvals required to allow the Bidder to
deliver the services and products at the prices it proposes in its
bid; and</li>
<li value="3">raise with Canada, during the enquiry period, any
concerns about conflicts between the bid solicitation (including
the resulting contract clauses) and any <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> regulations or
rulings, by identifying:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the specific requirement in the bid solicitation that
creates the conflict; and</li>
<li value="2"> the specific provisions of <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> regulations or rulings that
affect the bid solicitation requirement (including document titles,
dates, page and paragraph numbers).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li value="2">Bidders may wish, in preparing their bids, to seek
interpretations from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> if they are in doubt as to whether or
not the services, products and prices they propose to Canada in
their bid are subject to and in accordance with an existing tariff
or require the filing of an amendment to an existing tariff or a
new tariff.</li>
<li value="3">The Contracting Authority will consider issues of
conflicts between the requirements of the bid solicitation and <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>
regulations or rulings raised by bidders during the enquiries
period and may, in its sole discretion, amend the bid solicitation
if it determines that amendments are consistent with Canada's
operational requirements. However, Canada will not compromise its
operational requirements to accommodate individual bidders'
corporate or regulatory circumstances.</li>

best pre-estimate of the date by which the proposed new tariff or

for information purposes only.</li>
<li value="3">Following the bid closing date, during the evaluation
period, the Bidder must immediately advise the Contracting
Authority of any ruling from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> relating to this tariff that
affects its ability to provide the services, products or prices
proposed in its bid.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2008-05-122003-1evaluation-procedures">06 Evaluation Procedures for Bids based on a Draft Tariff</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The following procedures apply to the top-ranked bid
identified according to the evaluation process described in the bid
solicitation, if some or all of the proposed services or products
will be subject to a proposed new tariff or an existing tariff
subject to a proposed amendment (collectively referred to as the
"Draft Tariff").</li>
<li value="2">Unless the Bidder receives approval sooner, the
Contracting Authority will allow no less than the following time
period for the Bidder to obtain interim approval of the Draft
Tariff from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> considers the application on an <em>ex parte</em> basis, no fewer than forty-five (45) working days
following the bid closing date; or</li>
<li value="2">if the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> uses a public process to consider the
application, no fewer than sixty (60) working days following the
bid closing date.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following this period, the Contracting Authority may, at any
time, require the Bidder to obtain interim approval from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>
on ten (10) working days' notice. The Contracting Authority may, in
its sole discretion, extend this ten (10) working day period. In
determining whether or not to grant such an extension, the
Contracting Authority may request from the Bidder any information
it requires to consider the request and the impact of the request
on Canada's operational requirements. The time periods described
above (including extensions authorized by the Contracting
Authority) are collectively referred to as the "Allotted Approval
Time".</p>
</li>
<li value="3">If the Bidder does not, within the Allotted Approval
Time, obtain interim approval of the Draft Tariff from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>,
the Contracting Authority will declare the bid non-responsive.</li>
<li value="4">If, in the Allotted Approval Time, a bidder receives
interim approval of its Draft Tariff in the form in which it was
filed (i.e., the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>'s interim approval is not subject to
conditions and the Bidder was not required to revise the Draft
Tariff in order to obtain interim approval), the Contracting
Authority will recommend the bid for contract award, subject to the
provisions of the bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="5">If, in the Allotted Approval Time, the Bidder
receives interim approval of its Draft Tariff, but the interim
approval is subject to conditions or the Bidder is required to
revise the Draft Tariff in order to obtain interim approval, then:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Bidder must submit the following to the
Contracting Authority (all within five (5) working days following
the expiry of the Allotted Approval Time):
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the Draft Tariff in the form approved by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> or
the specific URL where that tariff can be found, together with any
information required to identify the tariff;</li>
<li value="2">a list of any conditions subject to which the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> has
given the interim approval;</li>
<li value="3">a list of all revisions made to the version of the Draft
Tariff originally submitted with the bid and an explanation of how
these changes affect the bid; and</li>
<li value="4">Regulatory Form D.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Canada will review this submission and, in respect of
the aspects of the bid that are affected by the revisions, Canada
will determine whether the amendments to the original Draft Tariff
affect:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the Bidder's compliance with the mandatory
requirements of the bid solicitation;</li>
<li value="2">the Bidder's score under the rated requirements of the bid
solicitation, if any; or</li>
<li value="3">the Bidder's ranking vis-à-vis other bidders in
accordance with the evaluation process described in the bid
solicitation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">If Canada determines that the Bidder remains
responsive and that its ranking vis-à-vis other bidders has
been unaffected by the amendments to the Draft Tariff, the
Contracting Authority will recommend the bid for contract award,
subject to the provisions of the bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="4">If Canada determines that, as a result of the
revisions to the Draft Tariff, the Bidder is either no longer
responsive or is no longer the top-ranked bidder, Canada will
proceed to consider the next-ranked bid for contract award, subject
again to the provisions of the bid solicitation relating to the
approval of any Draft Tariff.</li>
<li value="5">If a contract is awarded on the basis of an interim
approval of a Draft Tariff, Canada may request that all bidders
that have submitted responsive bids extend the validity period of
their bids until final approval is granted by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>. If Canada
terminates the contract as a result of the form of the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>'s final
approval of the Draft Tariff, Canada may, at its option:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">cancel the bid solicitation;</li>
<li value="2">award the contract to the next-highest-ranked bidder whose
bid is still valid (i.e., a bid that the Bidder extended), in
accordance with the provisions of the bid solicitation; or</li>
<li value="3">reissue a bid solicitation for the requirement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bidders will have no obligation to extend the validity period
for their bids; however, bidders who do not extend the validity
period for their bids will not qualify for acceptance if Canada,
following termination of the original contract, chooses option (ii)
above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="6">If, during the Allotted Approval Time, the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>
provides final approval of the Draft Tariff, the same procedure
will be followed that would apply if the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> had provided interim
approval only.</li>
<li value="7">This procedure has been developed in order to allow
bidders who are required to submit new or revised tariffs to the
 <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> to comply with the requirements of the bid solicitation to
compete for this requirement. This procedure will also ensure that
bidders have an opportunity, if the services or products to be
provided under any resulting contract constitute a "bundle"
pursuant to any rulings issued by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>, to seek approval to
provide these services and products.</li>
<li value="8">A period of time has been allotted for bidders to
complete any necessary processes with the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>. However, the time
allowed for these processes must also be consistent with Canada and
the client's operational requirements. The Contracting Authority
will only grant extensions that it considers compatible with these
operational requirements.</li>
<li value="9">If, during the bid evaluation period, Canada proceeds
to consider the next-ranked bidder under paragraph 5.(e), it may
request that all remaining responsive bidders extend the validity
periods for their bids. Bidders will have no obligation to extend
the validity periods of their bid. However, Canada will only
continue to consider bids that remain valid for acceptance.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2008-05-122003-1part-ii">Part II: Regulatory Forms</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated in the bid solicitation, bidders are
requested to submit these regulatory forms with their bids on or
before the bid closing date. If a bidder has not included any
required regulatory form or has not, in the Contracting Authority's
view, completed the form properly, the Contracting Authority will
provide the Bidder with an opportunity to submit the forms during
the evaluation period. If the Bidder does not submit the forms
within the period set by the Contracting Authority, its bid will be
declared non-responsive.</p>
<p>If different services or products proposed by the Bidder are
subject to different regulatory circumstances - for example, if
some services or products are non-regulated or forborne, some
services or products are subject to existing tariffs, and some
services or products are proposed to be subject to new or amended
tariffs - the Bidder is required to submit Regulatory Forms A, B
and <abbr title="Contract">C</abbr> and specify which services or products fit into each of these
categories. Given that the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> regulates different suppliers in
different ways, this certification is required from each member of
any joint venture bidder.</p>
