<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Bidders are to include with their Bid current and valid certification of 
the capacity and condition of the docking facility to be used for the Work.  
This certification shall be provided by a recognized consultant or 
classification society following an inspection of the docking facility.

Although a dry docking facility may have a total capacity greater than the 
vessel to be docked, the weight distribution of the vessel may cause 
individual block loading to be exceeded.  Also, while the physical 
dimensions of a dry docking facility may indicate acceptability for docking 
of a specific vessel, other limitations such as spacing of rails on a 
marine railway, concrete piers of abutments adjoining the dry dock may, in 
fact, preclude the facility from being considered as a possible dry docking 
site.  The Bidder is further required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
Canada that the certified capacity of its dry docking facility is adequate 
for the anticipated loading as specified in the related dry docking plans 
and other documents.
