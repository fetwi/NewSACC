       (b)    As long as it is fully completed (including Box 6. with the 
              Contractor's invoice number and issue date), the DD Form 250 
              can be considered as the formal Commercial Invoice. However, 
              a copy of the Contractor's actual Commercial Invoice is 
              recommended when the billing includes special terms such as 
              discounts, freight or liquidation of progress payments when 
              not reflected on the DD Form 250.

<strong>2.     Accompanying Documents:</strong>

As per the terms of the Contract, such an invoice must be accompanied by 
documents as applicable below:

<strong>Based on Shipping Terms:</strong>

       FOB ORIGIN

       (a)    If shipment is made by U.S. government Bill of Lading, no 
              other shipping documents are required.

       <strong>N.B.   </strong>Specific authority must be granted by the U.S. Defense 
              Contract Management Command (DCMC) Americas/Procurement 
              Agency to ship by commercial carriers, prepay and add the 
              freight charges as a separate item on the invoice.

       (b)    In all cases, invoices reflecting freight prepaid to 
              destination must be supported by an evidence of shipment 
              (copy of the commercial Bill of Lading) and should the 
              charges be prepaid and then added to the invoice in the same 
              currency of the contract and exceed $100 US, a receipted 
              waybill must also be furnished to substantiate the charge.

       (c)    Furthermore, if not specifically authorized in the contract, 
              a call to DCMC Americas Transportation Division prior to 
              Commercial shipping is mandatory (613-992-9020). This step 
              will allow DCMC Americas to advise the Contractor of the 
              Commercial Carrier to use to ensure proper government rates 
              for the shipment involved. This is done through their 
              preparation of a U.S. DSA Form 359 (Instructions to 
              Contractors for Conus-Export Shipments). They will issue this 
              form for the Contractor's use. A copy of this form must 
              accompany the usual invoicing documents required.

       FOB  DESTINATION

       (Commercial Bill of Lading.)

                     unsigned) to the above-mentioned address of the 
                     Canadian Commercial Corporation. If unsigned, it will
