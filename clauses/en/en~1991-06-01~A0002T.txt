<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in bid solicitations for defence supplies, as defined 
in the Defence Production Act, valued at over $500,000, issued to U.S. or 
Canadian suppliers.  See SPM Directive 4007.

 
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Bidder shall clearly indicate in the proposal either of the following:

       (a)  the type and amount of recoupment charges payable to the U.S. 
       Department of Defense by the Bidder or its U.S. subcontractors with 
       subcontracts over C$500,000; or

       (b)  that recoupment charges do not apply.

As Canada may be eligible to receive a waiver of such charges, and as U.S. 
   legislation precludes application for a waiver following contract award, 
   failure to identify such charges in the proposal may result in a 
   significant loss of savings to Canada.  Canada will therefore not be 
   held responsible for paying such charges if the information has not been 
   provided.
