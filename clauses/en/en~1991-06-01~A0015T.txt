<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Minister of Supply and Services, or his/her designate, will evaluate 
the proposals received and such evaluation will include, but not be limited 
to, consideration of the effect of various factors, including the following:  

       (a) compliance with the terms and conditions of this Request for 
       Proposal;

       (b) the lowest Evaluation Price for a technically compliant Proposal 
       to the Crown for the Work, having regard to qualifications, 
       exceptions or alterations to the technical requirements;

       (c) assessment of all technical documentation and information by the 
       Technical Authority, for technical compliance;

       (d) delivery date;

       (e) other criteria:   

       [List of criteria. The number of criteria should be adequate for 
       comparative judgement. They should measure both the competence of 
       the proponent and the worth of the proponent's particular technical 
       approach.   

       The former set of considerations would include such factors as those 
       relating to managerial structure, key personnel, prior industrial 
       experience, facilities and financial strength. The latter set would 
       include the proposed work breakdown structure, identification of key 
       technical problems and outlines of solutions, proposed schedule of 
       milestones, quality and time control systems to be employed.]   

The Minister of Supply and Services reserves the right to reject any 
proposal which does not comply with this Request for Proposal.  Any 
deviation is to be clearly identified and supported with full details.    
The Crown reserves the right to negotiate changes to the technical 
requirements or terms and conditions of the Request for Proposal if it is 
in its interest to do so. Alternatively, a Proposal may be accepted without 
negotiations.   

Any Bidder may be required to demonstrate to the Crown's satisfaction as a 
result of the evaluation that it is capable of successfully completing the 
Work in accordance with this RFP. A Liquidated Damages clause may form part 
of any resulting contract.  

Information in proposals is confidential and shall be so treated by the 
   Crown from the receipt of a proposal to the award of a contract and it 
   shall not be given to anyone outside of the Public Service.
