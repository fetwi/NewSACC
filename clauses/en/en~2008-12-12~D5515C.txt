<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>All work is subject to Government Quality Assurance performed at the 
Contractor's or subcontractor's facility,  and at the installation site, by 
the Director of Quality Assurance, or its designated Quality Assurance 
Representative (QAR).

       Director of Quality Assurance
       National Defence Headquarters

       101 Colonel By Drive
       Ottawa, ON   K1A 0K2

If the Contractor has not been contacted by the QAR performing GQA in the 
Contractor's facility or area within forty-five (45) working days of award 
of the Contract, the Contractor must notify the Contracting Authority.

Where no official arrangements for mutual GQA have been concluded, the 
Department of National Defence will arrange for the GQA services to be 
conducted by a National Quality Assurance Authority acceptable to the 
Director of Quality Assurance.  If the GQA services must be provided on a 
cost-recovery basis, the costs for the services must be accrued against the 
Contract and be discharged through separate invoicing.

The Design Change, Deviation and Waiver Procedure as defined in National 
Defence Standard D-02-006-008/SG-001 apply to the Contract. A copy of the 
standard can be obtained from the nearest NDQAR office.

The Contractor is responsible for performing, or having performed, all 
inspections and tests necessary to substantiate that the materiel or 
services provided conform to the requirements of the Contract.

The Contractor must provide, at no additional cost, all applicable test 
data, all technical data, test pieces and samples as may reasonably be 
required by the QAR to verify conformity to the requirements of the 
Contract.  The Contractor must forward at its expense such technical data, 
test data, test pieces and samples to such location as the QAR may direct.

Quality control, inspection and test records that substantiate conformity 
to the specified requirements, including records of corrective actions, 
must be retained by the Contractor for three (3) years from the date of 
completion or termination of the Contract and must be made available to the 
QAR upon request.
