              signed by the Contractor authorizing payment of the said 
              claim or claims.

              (1)    should have been paid in full under the claimant's 
                     contract with the Contractor or subcontractor where 
                     the claim is for money that was lawfully required to 
                     be held back  from the claimant; or

                     subcontractor where the claim is not for money 
                     referred to in Section 12.6.1.1, and

       (b)    The proceedings to determine the right to payment of the 
              claim shall have commenced within one year from the date that 
              the notice referred to in Section 12.6.1 was received by the <em>
              Architect/Engineer</em>.

12.7   Her Majesty may, upon receipt of a notification of claim referred to 
       in Section 12.6.1, withhold from any amount that is due and payable 
       to the Contractor pursuant to the contract the full amount of the 
       claim or any portion thereof.

       receipt of any notification of claim and of the intention of Her

       claimant, post with Her Majesty, security in a form acceptable to 
       Her Majesty in an amount equal to the value of the said claim.  Upon 
       receipt of such security Her Majesty shall release to the Contractor 
       any funds which would be otherwise payable to the Contractor, that

       (b)    decide any question as to whether anything has been done as 
              required by the contract or as to what the Contractor is

              acceptability of the quality or quantity of any labour, plant 
              or material used in the execution of the <em>work</em> and the timing

              change the whole or any part of the <em>work</em> provided for in the 
              plans and specifications.  The <em>Architect/Engineer</em> shall 
              decide whether anything done or not done as a result of 
              directions given under this sub-section has increased or 
              decreased the cost of the <em>work</em> to the Contractor and the 
              amount payable under the contract to the Contractor will be 
              increased or decreased accordingly by an amount calculated in

the <em>work</em>, fails to comply with a direction or decision of the <em>Architect/
Engineer</em> properly give, or is in default in any other manner under the 
contract, the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> may do such things as he deems necessary 
to correct the Contractor's default.  The Contractor will reimburse Her 
Majesty for all costs, expenses and damage incurred or sustained by Her 
Majesty, by reason of the Contractor's default, or in correcting the 
default.  In addition to the aforementioned remedies in this section, the <em>
Minister</em> may, if the default continues for 6 days after notice in writing 
of default has been given to the Contractor by the <em>Architect/Engineer</em>, 
terminate the contract in accordance with Section 17.3.

<strong>15     (16/02/98)    Changes in Soil Conditions, Delay by Her Majesty, etc.</strong>

15.1   No extra payment will be made to the Contractor for any extra 
       expense, loss or damage for any reason unless the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> 
       shall certify that such extra expense, loss or damage is directly 
       attributable to:

       (a)    a substantial difference between the soil conditions at the 
              site of the <em>work</em> indicated by the plans and specifications 
              and the actual soil conditions found there;

       (b)    neglect or delay by Her Majesty, occurring after the date of 
              contract, in providing any information or doing any act which 
              is required expressly by the contract or by usage of the 
              trade, or suspension of the<em> work</em> by the <em>Minister</em>;

       and the Contractor has within 30 days of encountering such soil 
       conditions or of the commencement of such neglect or delay, given 
       written notice to the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> of a claim for such extra 
       expense, loss or damage.  The amount of any extra payment to be made 
       under this Section will be calculated in accordance with Section 19.

15.2   If in the opinion of the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> any difference in soil 
       conditions referred to in subsection .1.1 hereto results in a saving 
       of expenditure to the Contractor the amount of such saving shall be 
       paid to Her Majesty by the Contractor.

<strong>16     (16/02/98)    Protesting Architect/Engineer's Decision</strong>

If the Contractor, within 10 days of receiving any decision or direction of 
the <em>Architect/Engineer</em>, gives written notice to the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> that 
the decision or direction is accepted under protest, Her Majesty will pay 
to the Contractor the cost, calculated according to Section 19, of anything 
that the Contractor was required to do, as a result of the decision or 
direction, beyond what the contract correctly understood would have 
required him to do.

<strong>17     (16/02/98)    Suspension or Termination of the Contract</strong>

       terminate the contract at any time.  The Contractor will comply with

       must, subject to his remedy under Section 15 hereof, complete the <em>
       work</em> when called upon to do so.  If the <em>Minister</em> suspends the <em>work</em> 
       for a period in excess of 30 days the Contractor may request the <em>
       Minister</em> to terminate the <em>work</em> under subsection 17.4 hereof.

17.3   If the <em>Minister</em> terminates the contract because of default by the 
       Contractor, the insolvency of or the commission of an act of 
       bankruptcy by the Contractor, the obligation of Her Majesty to make 
       payments to the Contractor shall cease and no further payments shall 
       be made to the Contractor unless the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> shall 
       certify that no financial prejudice will result to Her Majesty from 
       such further payments.  Termination under this subsection shall not 
       relieve the Contractor of any legal or contractual obligations other 
       than the physical completion of the <em>work</em>.  In such circumstances the <em>
       Architect/Engineer</em> may complete or have the <em>work</em> completed as he 
       sees fit and all costs and damages incurred by Her Majesty due to 
       the non-completion of the <em>work</em> by the Contractor shall be payable by 
       the Contractor to Her Majesty.

17.4   If the <em>Minister</em> terminates the <em>work</em> other than in accordance with 
       subsection .3 hereof Her Majesty will pay to the Contractor an 
       amount calculated in accordance with Section 19 hereof subject to 
       any additions or deductions otherwise provided by the General 
       Conditions or Labour Conditions less any payments made pursuant to 
       Section 25.3 hereof.  In no event, however, shall such amount be 
       greater than the amount which would have been payable to the 
       Contractor had the contract been completed.

<strong>18     (16/02/98)    No Additional Payments</strong>

The amount payable to the Contractor under this contract will not be 
increased or decreased by reason of any increase or decrease in the cost of 
the <em>work</em> brought about by any increase in the cost of plant, labour or 
material, except that, in the event of a change in any tax, that affects 
the cost of any materials incorporated in or to be incorporated in the <em>work</em>, 
imposed under the <em>Excise Act</em>, the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, the <em>Old Age Security Act</em>, 
the <em>Customs Act</em> or <em>Customs Tariff</em>, made public after the date of the 
submission of the tender, an appropriate adjustment may be made.

<strong>19     (01/12/00)    Determination of Costs</strong>

19.1   For the purposes of GC11, GC13.3, GC15, GC16, and GC17.4 and subject 
       to the provisions of Section 25.2.2, the amount payable to the 
       Contractor for any change in the scope of work requested by the <em>
       Architect/Engineer </em>shall be based on the Unit Prices as set out in 
       Clause 4 of the Tender and Acceptance.

19.2   If the Unit Prices referred to in GC19.1 cannot be used to determine 
       the amount payable to the Contractor due to a change in the scope of 
       the work, then the Contractor shall submit to the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> 
       a quotation of the Contractor's costs for all labour, plant and 
       material required by the change.  The Contractor shall include a 
       mark-up in an amount equal to 20% of its costs for the labour, plant 
       and material portion of the work to be done by its own forces and an 
       additional mark-up in an amount equal to 15% of all quotations 
       received from its subcontractors.  The Contractor shall ensure that 
       its subcontractor shall include a mark-up in an amount equal to 20% 
       of its costs for the labour, plant and material portion of the work 
       to be done by the subcontractors own forces and an additional 
       mark-up in an amount equal to 15% of all quotations received from 
       its sub-subcontractors.  The mark-ups referred to herein shall be 
       considered full compensation for all supervision, coordination, 
       administration, overhead, margin, finance and interest charges, and 
       the risk of undertaking the work within a stipulated amount.  The 
       Contractor's and subcontractors' costs shall be inclusive of all 
       contractor and trade discounts.  Quotations referred to herein shall 
       be prepared and submitted in accordance with Section 01017 of the 
       Specifications.

19.3   If the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> and the Contractor fail to reach agreement 
       on the prices quoted in GC19.2, then the amount payable to the 
       Contractor shall be all reasonable and proper costs paid or legally 
       payable by the Contractor that are directly attributable to the 
       change in the scope of the work plus an additional amount equal to 
       10% of such costs to cover overhead, finance and interest charges, 
       and margin.  The Contractor shall provide evidence of such costs to 
       the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> with its progress claim or invoice.

<strong>20     (16/02/98)    Records to be Kept</strong>

The Contractor shall for a period of two years from the date of the Final 
Certificate of Completion, maintain and keep full records, vouchers, other 
writings and information in respect of his estimates and actual cost of the <em>
work</em> and shall make them available for copy, audit or inspection by any

21.1   The <em>Minister</em> may, on the application of the Contractor made before 
       the day fixed for the completion of the <em>work</em>, extend the time for 
       the completion of the <em>work</em>.  Whether or not the <em>Minister</em> grants an 
       extension, the Contractor shall, except to the extent that the <em>
       Minister</em> is of the opinion that the need for an extension was due to 
       causes beyond the control of the Contractor, pay to Her Majesty.

       (a)    an amount equal to Departmental inspection costs relating to 
              the <em>work</em> incurred after the original completion date and

       (b)    compensation for any loss or damage resulting to Her Majesty 
              from failure by the Contractor to complete the <em>work</em> by the 
              original completion date.

<strong>22     (16/02/98)    Cleaning of Work</strong>

with the contract and all orders and directions pursuant thereto to the 
satisfaction of the <em>Architect/Engineer</em>, the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> will issue

such time as specified in said notice, rectify at his own expense any

       together with the aggregate of the amounts payable by Her Majesty 
       under Sections 11, 13.3, 15.1, 16 and 18 exceed the aggregate of any 
       payments by Her Majesty under Section 12 and indemnification and

       under Sections 4, 5, 9, 13.3, 14, 15.2, 17.3, 18 and 21.

25.2   In the case of a unit price contract:

       (a)    The amount referred to in Clause 1 of the Tender and 
              Acceptance will be deemed to be the amount computed by 
              totalling the products of the unit prices set out in Clause 4 
              of the Tender and Acceptance, as amended pursuant to 
              sub-paragraph .2.2 hereof, if applicable, and the actual 
              quantities of such units as set out in the 
              <em>Architect/Engineer</em>'s Final Certificate of 
              Measurement, subject to any adjustment provided for in 
              sub-paragraph .2.2 of this section.

       (b)    The <em>Architect/Engineer</em> and the Contractor may by agreement in 
              writing add to the aforesaid Unit Price Table other classes 
              of labour, etc., units of measure, estimated quantities and 
              prices per unit, and may if the actual quantities as set out 
              in the aforesaid Final Certificate of Measurement exceed or 
              fall short of the estimated quantities in respect of any 
              item(s) shown in the aforesaid Unit Price Table by more than 
              15% amend the unit prices shown in the Unit Price Table for 
              such items, provided that in the event the actual quantities 
              exceed the estimated quantities by more than 15% the 
              aforementioned amendment to the unit prices shall apply only 
              to the actual quantities in excess of 115% of the estimated 
              quantities.  Where the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> and the Contractor 
              fail to agree on the amount of any adjustment as contemplated 
              by this subsection the revised or new prices per unit shall 
              be determined in accordance with Section 19 hereof.

25.3   If the amount of the Contract is in excess of $5,000 the Contractor 
       shall be entitled to receive progress payments upon submitting 
       Progress Claims which must be approved by Progress Reports issued by 
       the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> at monthly intervals.  The amount to be paid 
       to the Contractor for a progress payment shall be 90% of the value 
       of the <em>work</em> certified by the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> in the Progress 
       Report as having been completed since the date of the immediately 
       preceding Progress Claim, if any. 

25.4   Thirty days after receipt by the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> of the Progress 
       Claim and if the Contractor has made and delivered to the <em>Architect/
       Engineer</em> his Statutory Declaration pursuant to Section 12 the amount 
       of the Progress Claim, subject to subsection .3 of this section, 
       shall become due and payable.

25.5   Sixty days after the issue by the <em>Architect/Engineer</em> of the Final 
       Certificate of Completion there shall become due and payable to the 
       Contractor the amount described in subsection .1 of this section 
       less the aggregate of the amounts, if any, paid pursuant to 
       subsection .3 of this section.

25.6   Notwithstanding subsections 25.3, 25.4 and 25.5 above, an amount 
       shall be due and payable to the Contractor only if the Contractor 
       has supplied a Statutory Declaration pursuant to section 12 of the 
       General Conditions.  The amount referred to above shall be due and 
       payable as indicated in subsection 25.4 and 25.5 above or, in the 
       case where the Contractor failed to provide a Statutory Declaration, 
       15 days after such Statutory Declaration was made and delivered to 
       the <em>Architect/Engineer</em>, whichever is later.

25.7   A payment by Her Majesty pursuant to this section shall not be 
       construed as evidence that the <em>work</em> is satisfactory or in accordance 
       with the contract.

25.8   Delay in making payment by Her Majesty under this section shall not 
       be deemed to be a breach of the contract.

       (a)    However, subject to subsection 25.6 above and paragraph 25.8.2 
              below, Her Majesty shall pay the Contractor simple interest 
              on any amount overdue, at the Average Bank Rate plus 3 % per 
              year.  The interest shall apply from and include the day such 
              amount became overdue until the day prior to the date of 
              payment.

       (b)    Interest in accordance with paragraph 25.8.1 above shall be 
              paid to the Contractor without demand, except that, in 
              respect of amounts which are less than 15 days overdue, no 
              interest shall be  paid in respect of payment made within 
              such 15 days unless the Contractor so demands after such 
              amounts have become due.

       (c)    The "<em>Average Bank Rate</em>" means the simple arithmetic mean of 
              the Bank Rate in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time 
              each day during the calendar month which immediately precedes 
              the calendar month in which payment is made.

       (d)    The "<em>Bank Rate</em>" means the rate of interest established from 
              time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at 
              which the Bank of Canada makes short term advances to members 
              of the Canadian Payments Association.

9.     Her Majesty may set-off against any amount payable or debt due by 
       Her Majesty under this contract the amount of any debt due to Her 
       Majesty under this contract or any other contract between the 
       Contractor and Her Majesty.
