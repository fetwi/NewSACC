prescribed nature.

Professional or prescribed services may be defined as, but not limited to, 
consulting, design, training, educational, management, architectural, health,

If either the contracting officer or the client believe that the suggested

limits may be established in consultation with the client and Public Works and 
Government Services Canada's Risk Management and Insurance Advisory Services at 
NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca.

The contracting officer should also refer to G2015D for important additional

individually selected and included in the endorsements found in this clause.
