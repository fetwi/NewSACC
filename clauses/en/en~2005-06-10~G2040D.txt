<pre>Environmental Impairment Liability insurance protects the Contractor against 
claims caused by chronic pollution damage to the environment

It is important to note for the purposes of insurance, that the term pollution 
will normally include most waste products.  Accordingly, coverage under simple 
liability policies will thus be excluded.  In order to gain this coverage, this 
clause is used in all cases where the Contractor owns or operates a waste 
disposal facility.

At times, it is equally effective to simply add endorsement (c) of G2015D to the 
basic clause G2001D requirement where the Contractor may generate the risk 
exposure by virtue of the contract but not necessarily be owner or operator of 
the facilities itself.

The term Contractor's Pollution Liability is also common in the insurance 
industry for certain regions and equally acceptable.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $1,000,000 per loss is not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and Public Works and 
Government Services Canada's Risk Management and Insurance Advisory Services, at 
NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca.

The contracting officer should also refer to G2015D for important additional 
endorsements that may apply to specific contracting areas and that are to be 
individually selected and included in the endorsements found in this clause.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Environmental Impairment Liability insurance shall be effected by 
       the Contractor and maintained in force throughout the duration of 
       the Contract, in an amount usual for a contract of this nature, but, 
       in any case, for a limit of liability NOT LESS THAN $1,000,000 per 
       accident or occurrence and in the aggregate.

2.     If this is a claims made policy and the duration of the Contract 
       exceeds the policy term; in the event of cancellation or non-renewal 
       of the policy, an Extended Claims Reporting Endorsement, minimum 
       twelve (12) months, must be secured by the Contractor.

3.     The following endorsements must be included:

       (a)    Additional Insured:  Canada is included as an additional 
              insured, but only with respect to liabilities that may arise 
              from the Contractor's own negligence in the performance of 
              the Contract.

              The interest of Canada as additional insured should read as 
              follows: Canada, represented by ________ (<strong class="wsStyleUnderline">insert client 
              department's name</strong>) and/or Public Works and Government 
              Services Canada.

       (b)    Notice of Cancellation or Amendment:  The Insurer agrees to 
              provide the Contracting Authority thirty (30) days written 
              notice of policy cancellation.

       (c)    Cross Liability:  Without increasing the limit of liability, 
              the policy shall protect all insured parties to the full 
              extent of coverage provided.  Further, the policy shall apply 
              to each Insured in the same manner and to the same extent as 
              if a separate policy had been issued to each.

       (d)    Contractual Liability:  The policy shall, on a blanket basis 
              or by specific reference to this Contract, extend to assumed 
              liabilities with respect to contractual insurance provisions.

       (e)    Employees and (where applicable) Volunteers as Additional 
              Insured:  All employees and (where applicable) volunteers, on 
              behalf of the Contractor, shall be included as additional 
              insured.

       (f)    Voluntary Medical Payments, $5,000 per person, $25,000 per 
              accident:  To provide for expenses incurred in instances of 
              minor accidental bodily injuries without determination of 
              liability.

       (g)    Incidental Transit Extension:  To provide coverage for 
              incidents arising in the transport of waste material.
