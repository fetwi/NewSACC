<strong>Code of Conduct for Procurement</strong>

To comply with the Code of Conduct for Procurement, suppliers must respond 
to Requests for Supply Arrangements (RFSAs) in an honest, fair and 
comprehensive manner, accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the 
requirements stipulated in the RFSA and resulting supply arrangement, 
submit bids and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all 
obligations of the contract. 

To ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the bidding process, the 
following activities are prohibited:

(a)    payment of a contingency fee by any party to a contract to a person 
       to whom the <em>Lobbyists Registration Act</em>, R.S. 1985, c. 44 (4th 
       Supplement) applies;

(b)    corruption and collusion in the bidding process for contracts for 
       the provision of goods and services.

By submitting an arrangement, the Supplier certifies that it meets the 
above requirements.

Suppliers further understand that the commission of certain offences may 
render them ineligible to be awarded a contract. By submitting an 
arrangement, the Supplier declares that it has never been convicted of an 
offence under Section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor 
subscribing to election fund</em>), Section 124 (Selling or Purchasing Office), 
Section 380 (<em>Fraud committed against Her Majesty</em>) or Section 418 (<em>Selling 
defective stores to Her Majesty</em>) of the Criminal Code of Canada, or under 
paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>) subsection 80(2) (<em>
Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or Section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of 
the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>.


<strong>General Information</strong>

A supply arrangement is a method of supply used by PWGSC to procure goods 
and services.  A supply arrangement is an arrangement between Canada and 
pre-qualified suppliers that allows departments and agencies to solicit 
bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements 
within the scope of a supply arrangement. A supply arrangement is not a 
contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and 
neither party is legally bound as a result of signing a supply arrangement 
alone. The intent of a supply arrangement is to establish a framework to 
permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations which result 
in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those 
bid solicitations.

RFSAs are posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) and 
suppliers who are interested in responding to individual bid solicitations 
issued under a supply arrangement framework are invited to submit an 
arrangement to become pre-qualified suppliers. The list of pre-qualified 
suppliers will be used as a source list for future procurements and only 
suppliers who are pre-qualified at the time individual bid solicitations 
are issued will be eligible to bid. It will however be possible for 
suppliers who were not successful to qualify during the period of a supply 
arrangement in accordance with the process described in the RFSA. New 
suppliers will also be able to qualify as RFSAs will be posted on GETS from 
time to time as stated in the RFSA. Supply arrangements include a set of 
predetermined conditions that will apply to subsequent bid solicitations 
and contracts. Supply arrangements may include ceiling prices which may be 
lowered based on an actual requirement or scope of work described in a bid 
solicitation.


<strong>01     Procurement Business Number</strong>

Canadian suppliers are required to have a Procurement Business Number (PBN) 
before issuance of a supply arrangement.  Suppliers may register for a PBN 
in the Supplier Registration Information service on line at the Business 
Access Canada Website.   For non-Internet registration, suppliers may 
contact the Business Access Canada InfoLine at 1-800-811-1148 to obtain the 
telephone number of the nearest Supplier Registration Agent.

<strong>02     Standard Instructions, Clauses and Conditions</strong>

Pursuant to the <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>, S.C. 
1996, c.16, the instructions, clauses and conditions identified in the RFSA 
and resulting supply arrangement by number, date and title are incorporated 
by reference into and form part of the RFSA and supply arrangement as 
though expressly set out in the RFSA and resulting supply arrangement.

<strong>03     Definition of Supplier</strong>

"Supplier" means the person or entity (or, in the case of a joint venture, 
the persons or entities) submitting a supply arrangement. It does not 
include the parent, subsidiaries or other affiliates of the Supplier, or 
its subcontractors.

<strong>04     Submission of Arrangements</strong>

1.     Canada requires that each arrangement, at closing date and time or 
       upon request from the Supply Arrangement Authority, be signed by the 
       Supplier or by an authorized representative of the Supplier.  If an 
       arrangement is submitted by a joint venture, it must be in 
       accordance with section 16.

2.     It is the Supplier's responsibility to:

       (a)    obtain clarification of the requirements contained in the 
              RFSA, if necessary, before submitting an arrangement;

       (b)    prepare the arrangement in accordance with the instructions 
              contained in the RFSA;

       (c)    submit by closing date and time a complete arrangement;

       (d)    send the arrangement only to PWGSC Bid Receiving Unit 
              specified on page 1 of the RFSA or to the address specified 
              in the RFSA;

       (e)    ensure that the Supplier's name, return address, RFSA number, 
              and RFSA closing date and time are clearly visible on the 
              envelope or the parcel(s) containing the arrangement; and,

       (f)    provide a comprehensible and sufficiently detailed 
              arrangement, including all requested pricing details, that 
              will permit a complete evaluation in accordance with the 
              criteria set out in the RFSA.

3.     If Canada has provided suppliers with multiple formats of a document 
       (for example, a document may be downloaded through the Government 
       Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) but may also be made available 
       on CD-ROM through GETS), the format downloaded through GETS will 
       take precedence.  If Canada posts an amendment to the RFSA revising 
       any documents provided to suppliers in multiple formats, Canada will 
       not necessarily update all formats to reflect these revisions.  It 
       is the Supplier's responsibility to ensure that revisions made 
       through any RFSA amendment issued through GETS are taken into 
       account in the alternate formats it uses of RFSA documents.

4.     Arrangements will remain open for acceptance for a period of not 
       less than sixty (60) days from the closing date of the RFSA, unless 
       specified otherwise in the RFSA.  Canada reserves the right to seek 
       an extension of the arrangement validity period from all responsive 
       suppliers in writing, within a minimum of three (3) days before the 
       end of the arrangement validity period.  If the extension is 
       accepted by all responsive suppliers, Canada will continue with the 
       evaluation of the arrangements.  If the extension is not accepted by 
       all responsive suppliers, Canada will, at its sole discretion, 
       either continue with the evaluation of the arrangements of those who 
       have accepted the extension or cancel the RFSA.

5.     Arrangements and supporting information may be submitted in either 
English or French.

6.     Arrangements received on or before the stipulated RFSA closing date 
       and time will become the property of Canada and will not be returned.  
       All arrangements will be treated as confidential, subject to the 
       provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, R.S. 1985, c. A-1 and 
       the <em>Privacy Act</em>, R.S. 1985, c. P-21.

7.     Unless specified otherwise in the RFSA, Canada will evaluate only 
       the documentation provided with the arrangement.  Canada will not 
       evaluate information such as references to Website addresses where 
       additional information can be found, or technical manuals or 
       brochures not submitted with the arrangement.

<strong>05     Late Arrangements</strong>

PWGSC will return arrangements delivered after the stipulated RFSA closing 
date and time, unless they qualify as a delayed arrangement as described 
below.

<strong>06     Delayed Arrangements</strong>

1.     An arrangement delivered to the specified bid receiving unit after 
       the closing date and time but before the supply arrangement issuance 
       date may be considered, provided the delay can be proven to have 
       been due solely to a delay in delivery that can be attributed to the 
       Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a foreign 
       country).  Purolator Inc. is not considered to be part of CPC for 
       the purposes of delayed arrangements.  The only pieces of evidence 
       relating to a delay in the CPC system that are acceptable to PWGSC 
       are:

       (a)    CPC cancellation date stamp; or
       (b)    CPC Priority Courier bill of lading; or
       (c)    CPC Xpresspost label 

       that clearly indicates that the arrangement was mailed before the 
       RFSA closing date.

2.     For arrangements transmitted by facsimile, only the date, time and 
       place of receipt recorded by PWGSC will be accepted as evidence of a 
       delayed arrangement.

3.     Misrouting, traffic volume, weather disturbances, labour disputes or 
       any other causes for the late delivery of arrangements are not 
       acceptable reasons for the arrangement to be accepted by PWGSC.

4.     Postage meter imprints, whether imprinted by the Supplier, the CPC 
       or the postal authority outside Canada, are not acceptable as proof 
       of timely mailing.

<strong>07     Transmission by Facsimile</strong>

1.     Unless specified otherwise in the RFSA, arrangements may be 
       submitted by facsimile. The only acceptable facsimile number for 
       responses to RFSAs issued by PWGSC headquarters is 819-997-9776.  
       The facsimile number for responses to RFSAs issued by PWGSC regional 
       offices is identified in the RFSA.

2.     For arrangements transmitted by facsimile, Canada will not be 
       responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or 
       receipt of the faxed arrangement including, but not limited to, the 
       following:

       (a)    receipt of garbled or incomplete arrangement;
       (b)    availability or condition of the receiving facsimile 
              equipment;
       (c)    incompatibility between the sending and receiving equipment;
       (d)    delay in transmission or receipt of the arrangement;
       (e)    failure of the Supplier to properly identify the arrangement;
       (f)    illegibility of the arrangement; or 
       (g)    security of arrangement data.

3.     An arrangement transmitted by facsimile will constitute the formal 
       arrangement of the Supplier and must be submitted in accordance with 
       section 04.  Furthermore, the Supplier must send a written 
       confirmation of the arrangement within two (2) working days after 
       RFSA closing, unless specified otherwise in the RFSA.  All documents 
       confirming arrangements should bear the word "CONFIRMATION".

<strong>08     Customs Clearance</strong>

It is the responsibility of the Supplier to allow sufficient time to obtain 
customs clearance, where required, before the RFSA closing date and time.  
Delays related to the obtaining of customs clearance cannot be construed as 
"undue delay in the mail" and will not be accepted as a delayed arrangement 
under section 06.

<strong>09     Legal Capacity</strong>

The Supplier must have the legal capacity to contract. If the Supplier is a 
sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate body, the Supplier must 
provide, if requested by the Supply Arrangement Authority, a statement and 
any requested supporting documentation indicating the laws under which it 
is registered or incorporated together with the registered or corporate 
name and place of business. This also applies to suppliers submitting an 
arrangement as a joint venture.

<strong>10     Rights of Canada</strong>

Canada reserves the right to:

(a)    reject any or all arrangements received in response to the RFSA;

(b)    cancel the RFSA at any time;

(c)    reissue the RFSA;

(d)    if no responsive arrangements are received and the requirement is 
       not substantially modified, reissue the RFSA by inviting only the 
       suppliers who submitted an arrangement to re-submit arrangements 
       within a period designated by Canada; and

(e)          issue RFSAs and supply arrangements to pre-qualified suppliers 
       throughout the entire period of the supply arrangement.

<strong>11     Vendor Performance</strong>

1.     Canada may reject an arrangement where any of the following 
circumstances is present:

       (a)    the Supplier, or any employee or subcontractor included as 
              part of the arrangement, has been convicted under Section 121 
              (<em>Frauds on the government</em> &amp; Contractor subscribing to 
              election fund), Section 124 (<em>Selling or purchasing office</em>), 
              Section 380 (<em>Fraud committed against Her Majesty)</em> or Section 
              418 (<em>Selling defective stores to Her Majesty</em>) of the Criminal 
              Code or under paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or 
              return</em>) subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or 
              Section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <em>Financial 
              Administration Act</em>.

       (b)    the Supplier is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective 
              Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which renders 
              the Supplier ineligible to submit an arrangement for the 
              requirement;

       (c)    an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the 
              arrangement, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective 
              Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which would 
              render that employee or subcontractor ineligible to submit an 
              arrangement for the requirement, or the portion of the 
              requirement the employee or subcontractor is to perform;

       (d)    with respect to current or previous transactions with the 
              Government of Canada

              (i)    the Supplier is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, 
                     its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended 
                     period;

              (ii)   evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, 
                     fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with 
                     any law protecting individuals against any manner of 
                     discrimination, has been received with respect to the 
                     Supplier, any of its employees or any subcontractor 
                     included as part of the arrangement;

              (iii)  Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of 
                     suspension or termination for default with respect to 
                     a contract with the Supplier, any of its employees or 
                     any subcontractor included as part of the arrangement;

              (iv)   Canada determines that the Supplier's performance on 
                     other contracts, including the efficiency and 
                     workmanship as well as the extent to which the 
                     Supplier performed the Work in accordance with 
                     contractual clauses and conditions, is sufficiently 
                     poor to jeopardize the successful completion of any 
                     requirement to be bid on.

2.     Where Canada intends to reject an arrangement pursuant to a 
       provision of subsection 1, other than 1.(b), the Supply Arrangement 
       Authority will so inform the Supplier and provide the Supplier ten 
       (10) days within which to make representations, before making a 
       final decision on the arrangement rejection.

<strong>12     Communications - Solicitation Period</strong>

To ensure the integrity of the competitive RFSA process, enquiries and 
other communications regarding the RFSA must be directed only to the Supply 
Arrangement Authority identified in the RFSA.  Failure to comply with the 
request may result in the arrangement being declared non-responsive.

To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to suppliers, 
significant enquiries received and the replies to such enquiries will be 
provided simultaneously to suppliers to which the RFSA has been sent, 
without revealing the sources of the enquiries.


<strong>13     Arrangement Costs</strong>

No payment will be made for costs incurred in the preparation and 
submission of an arrangement in response to the RFSA. Costs associated with 
preparing and submitting an arrangement as well as any costs incurred by 
the Supplier associated with the evaluation of the arrangement, are the 
sole responsibility of the Supplier.

<strong>14     Conduct of Evaluation</strong>

1.     In conducting its evaluation of the arrangements, Canada may, but 
       will have no obligation to, do the following:

       (a)    seek clarification or verification from suppliers regarding 
              any or all information provided by them with respect to the 
              RFSA;

       (b)    contact any or all references supplied by suppliers to verify 
              and validate any information submitted by them;

       (c)    request, before issuance of any supply arrangement, specific 
              information with respect to suppliers' legal status;

       (d)    conduct a survey of suppliers' facilities and/or examine 
              their technical, managerial, and financial capabilities to 
              determine if they are adequate to meet the requirements of 
              the RFSA;

       (e)    verify any information provided by suppliers through 
              independent research, use of any government resources or by 
              contacting third parties;

       (f)    interview, at the sole costs of suppliers, any supplier and/
              or any or all of the resources proposed by suppliers to 
              fulfill the requirement of the RFSA.

2.     Suppliers will have the number of days specified in the request by 
       the Supply Arrangement Authority to comply with any request related 
       to any of the above items.  Failure to comply with the request may 
       result in the arrangement being declared non-responsive.

<strong>15     Joint Venture</strong>

1.     A joint venture is an association of two or more parties who combine 
       their money, property, knowledge, expertise or other resources in a 
       single joint business enterprise, sometimes referred as a consortium, 
       to submit an arrangement together on a requirement. Suppliers who 
       submit an arrangement as a joint venture must indicate clearly that 
       it is a joint venture and provide the following information:

       (a)    the name of each member of the joint venture;
       (b)    the Procurement Business Number of each member of the joint 
              venture;
       (c)    the name of the representative of the joint venture, i.e. the 
              member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf, if 
              applicable;
       (d)    the name of the joint venture, if applicable.

2.     If the information is not clearly provided in the arrangement, the 
       Supplier must provide the information on request from the Supply 
       Arrangement Authority.

3.     The arrangement must be signed by all the members of the joint 
       venture unless one member has been appointed to act on behalf of all 
       members of the joint venture.  The Supply Arrangement Authority may, 
       at any time, require each member of the joint venture to confirm 
       that the representative has been appointed with full authority to 
       act as its representative for the purposes of the RFSA and any 
       resulting supply arrangement. 

<strong>16     Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</strong><strong></strong>

1.     In order to protect the integrity of the procurement process, 
       suppliers are advised that Canada may reject an arrangement in the 
       following circumstances:

       (a)    if the Supplier, any of its subcontractors, any of their 
              respective employees or former employees was involved in any 
              manner in the preparation of the RFSA;

       (b)    if the Supplier, any of its subcontractors, any of their 
              respective employees or former employees had access to 
              information related to the RFSA that was not available to 
              other suppliers and that would, in Canada's opinion, give the 
              Supplier an unfair advantage.

2.     The experience acquired by a supplier who is providing or has 
       provided the goods and services described in the RFSA (or similar 
       goods or services) will not, in itself, be considered by Canada as 
       conferring an unfair advantage or creating a conflict of interest. 
       This supplier remains however subject to the criteria established 
       above.

3.     Where Canada intends to reject an arrangement under this section, 
       the Supply Arrangement Authority will inform the Supplier and 
       provide the Supplier an opportunity to make representations before 
       making a final decision.  Suppliers who are in doubt about a 
       particular situation should contact the Supply Arrangement Authority 
       before the RFSA closing date. By submitting an arrangement, the 
       Supplier represents that it does not consider itself to be in 
       conflict of interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Supplier 
       acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine 
       whether a conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.

<strong>17     Entire Requirement</strong><strong></strong>

The RFSA contains all the requirements relating to the solicitation. Any 
other information or documentation provided to or obtained by a supplier 
from any source are not relevant. Suppliers should not assume that 
practices used under previous contracts will continue, unless they are 
described in the RFSA. Suppliers should also not assume that their existing 
capabilities meet the requirements of the RFSA simply because they have met 
previous requirements.

<strong>18     Further Information</strong>

1.     For further information, suppliers may contact the Supply 
       Arrangement Authority identified in the RFSA.

2.     For RFSAs issued out of PWGSC headquarters, enquiries concerning 
       receipt of arrangements may be addressed to the Bid Receiving Unit, 
       Procurement Operational Support Division, telephone 819-956-3370.  
       For RFSAs issued out of PWGSC regional offices, enquiries concerning 
       receipt of offers may be addressed to the Supply Arrangement 
       Authority identified in the RFSA.
