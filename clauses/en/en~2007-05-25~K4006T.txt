<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in which the 
Canadian Content Policy is applicable (see Supply Manual) and where competition 
is being conditionally limited to bids offering Canadian goods and/or services.  
This clause is to be used for multi-item requirements that are being certified 
on an individual item basis and where the bidder is to list in the clause those 
items in its bid that are to be considered Canadian.

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K4000D.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is subject to a preference for Canadian goods and/
       or services as defined in clause K4000D.

2.     On an item-by-item basis, items that include this representation and 
       warranty will be given preference over other bids, if there are 
       three or more suppliers who have submitted bids with a valid 
       certification.  Bids may be accepted in whole or in part.

3.     The Bidder represents and warrants that, of the goods and/or 
       services being offered, the following items are Canadian goods and/
       or services as defined in clause K4000D, and acknowledges that only 
       those items will receive consideration. 
       ____________________

       ____________________

4.     The Bidder acknowledges that Canada relies upon such representation 
       and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any contract 
       resulting from the bid.  Such representation and warranty of 
       Canadian content may be verified in such manner as Canada may 
       reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by Canada disclose a breach of such covenant, 
       Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       bid as being in default.

6.     Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph and to include it with 
       the bid will result in all goods and/or services offered being 
       treated as non-Canadian.
