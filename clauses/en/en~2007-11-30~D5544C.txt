<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in contracts for the Department of National Defence 
when the work under the contract is for the calibration or testing of equipment.</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>In the performance of the Work described in the Contract the Contractor 
must conform to the requirements of:

       ISO/IEC 17025:2005 General requirements for the competence of 
       testing and calibration laboratories.

It is not the intent of this clause to require that the Contractor be 
registered to the applicable standard; however, the Contractor's quality 
management system must address each requirement contained in the standard.

<strong>Assistance for Government Quality Assurance</strong> (GQA)

The Contractor must provide the Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) with 
the accommodation and facilities required for the proper accomplishment of 
GQA and must provide any assistance required by the QAR for evaluation, 
verification, validation, documentation or release of product.

The QAR must have the right of access to any area of the Contractor's or 
subcontractor's facilities where any part of the Work is being performed. 
The QAR must be afforded unrestricted opportunity to evaluate and verify 
Contractor conformity with Quality System procedures and to validate 
product conformity with the requirements of the Contract.  The Contractor 
must make available for reasonable use by the QAR the equipment necessary 
for all validation purposes.  Contractor personnel must be made available 
for operation of such equipment as required.

When the QAR determines that GQA is required at a subcontractor's 
facilities, the Contractor must provide for this in the purchasing document 
and forward copies to the QAR, together with relevant technical data as the 
QAR may request.

The Contractor must notify the QAR of non-conforming product received from 
a Subcontractor when the product has been subject to GQA.
