<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause whenever definitions are required for procurement 
covered by the special procedures under the Canada-Korea Agreement on the 
Procurement of Telecommunications Equipment (CKTEA).

This clause should not be used when the procurement is also covered by the World 
Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP).  The special 
procedures under the CKTEA should only be used for procurement not covered by 
the WTO-AGP.  For procurement covered by both the CKTEA and the WTO-AGP, 
procedures for the WTO-AGP are followed. 

This clause must always be used whenever clauses K5001T, K5002T, K5003T, K5004T, 
K5005T and K5006T are used.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>For the purpose of the Canada-Korea Agreement on the Procurement of 
Telecommunications Equipment (CKTEA):

1.     (a)    A Good is considered a Canadian or Korean good if it is 
              considered so under Canada's "Determination of Country of 
              Origin for the Purposes of Marking Goods (NAFTA Countries) 
              Regulations".  Article 8 of these Regulations, which provides 
              for a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) tariff 
              preference override, cannot be used for determining whether a 
              good is Canadian.

       (b)    An Incidental Service means any service that is included in a 
              tender for the procurement of a Covered Good under this 
              Agreement.

              A Service provided by an individual based in Canada or Korea 
              is considered a Canadian or Korean service, respectively.  
              Where a requirement consists of only one service, which is 
              being provided by more than one individual, the service will 
              be considered Canadian or Korean if a minimum of 60 percent 
              of the total bid price for the service is provided by 
              individuals based in Canada or Korea.

       (c)    "Territory" means:

              (i)    with respect to Korea, the territory of Korea as well 
                     as those maritime areas, including the seabed and 
                     subsoil adjacent to the outer limit of the territorial 
                     areas over which Korea exercises, in accordance with 
                     international law, sovereign rights or jurisdiction 
                     for the purpose of exploration and exploitation of 
                     natural resources of such areas.

              (ii)   with respect to Canada, the territory to which its 
                     customs laws apply, including any areas beyond the 
                     territorial seas of Canada within which, in accordance 
                     with international law and its domestic laws, Canada 
                     may exercise rights with respect to the seabed and 
                     subsoil and their natural resources.

2.     Variety of goods: When requirements consist of more than one good, 
       the evaluation can be done in two ways:

       (a)    aggregate evaluation: no less than 60 percent of the total 
              bid price must consist of Canadian and/or Korean goods; or, 

       (b)    item by item evaluation: in some cases, the bid evaluation 
              may be conducted on an item-by-item basis and contracts may 
              be awarded to more than one supplier. In these cases, 
              suppliers will be asked to identify separately each item that 
              meets the definition of Canadian or Korean goods.

3.     Mix of goods and services: when requirements consist of a mix of 
       goods and services, no less than 60 percent of the total bid price 
       must consist of Canadian and/or Korean goods and services (as 
       defined above).
