<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use this clause in firm price contracts that may be subject to exchange rate fluctuation provisions where the goods or services or both include a foreign currency component.  This clause may be used for various methods of payment.
 </p>
<p>
  For solicitations, use this clause in conjunction with
  <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">
   SACC
  </abbr>
  Manual clause
  
   C3010T
  
  , Exchange Rate Risk Mitigation.  If not part of a solicitation, subsection 4 must be changed to set an "initial exchange rate" for the contract.
 </p>
<p>
  Where the "exchange rate for adjustment" is to be based on a date other than the delivery date, contracting officers must modify subsection 5, in consultation with legal services.  For example, if using the direct shipment date, as indicated on the Canada Customs Coding Form,
  <abbr title="Canada Border Services Agency">
   CBSA
  </abbr>
  Form B3-3, the following would apply:
 </p>
<blockquote>
  The exchange rate for adjustment will be the Bank of Canada rate on the date the goods were imported. The Bank of Canada publishes its rates each business day by 16:30 Eastern Time. The Canada Customs Coding Form,
  <abbr title="Canada Border Services Agency">
   CBSA
  </abbr>
  Form B3-3, showing the direct shipment date (release date), must accompany each applicable invoice.
 </blockquote>

<li value="1">The foreign currency component (FCC) is defined as the portion of the price or rate that will be directly affected by exchange rate fluctuation.  The <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> should include all related taxes, duties and other costs paid by the Bidder and which are to be included in the adjustment amount.</li>
<li value="2">For each line item where a <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> is identified, Canada assumes the risks and benefits for exchange rate fluctuation, as shown in the Basis of Payment.  For such items, the exchange rate fluctuation amount is determined in accordance with the provision of this clause.</li>
<li value="3">The total price paid by Canada on each invoice will be adjusted at the time of payment. The exchange rate adjustment amount will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
<br/>
<dfn>Exchange rate adjustment</dfn> = FCC x  Qty  x  ( i<sub>1</sub> - i<sub>0</sub> ) / i<sub>0</sub>
<br/>where formula variables correspond to:
<dl>
<dt><strong>FCC</strong></dt>
<dd>Foreign currency component (per unit)</dd>
<dt><strong>Qty</strong></dt> <dd>quantity of units</dd>
<dt><strong>i<sub>0</sub></strong></dt> <dd>Initial exchange rate (<abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per unit of foreign currency [for example <abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>1]).<br/>The initial exchange rate is set as the Bank of Canada rate on the solicitation closing date. The Bank of Canada publishes its rates each business day by 16:30 Eastern Time.</dd>
<dt><strong>i<sub>1</sub></strong></dt><dd>Exchange rate for adjustments (ERA) (<abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per unit of foreign currency [for example <abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>1]).

<ol type="a">
<li>The <abbr title="Exchange rate for adjustments">ERA</abbr> for goods will be the Bank of Canada rate on the date the goods were delivered. </li>

<li>The <abbr title="Exchange rate for adjustments">ERA</abbr> for advance payments will be the Bank of Canada rate on the last business day prior to the payment. The last published business day rate will be used for non-business days.</li>
</ol>
</dl>
</li>
<li value="4">The Contractor must indicate the total exchange rate adjustment amounts (whether they are upward, downward or present no change) as a separate item on each invoice or claim for payment submitted under the Contract.  Where an adjustment applies, the Contractor must submit with their invoice form PWGSC-TPSGC 450, Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments.</li>
<li value="5">The exchange rate adjustment will only impact the payment to be made by Canada where the exchange rate fluctuation is greater than 2% (increase or decrease), calculated in accordance with column 8 of form PWGSC-TPSGC 450 (that is [ i<sub>1</sub> - i<sub>0</sub> ) / i<sub>0</sub>]).</li>
