              and instructions and terms and conditions with respect to

<strong>DISTRIBUTION</strong>

2.     The <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual has 
       been produced in both conventional (print) and electronic format. 
       The print format contains information on current clauses and 
       conditions as well as instructions on how these clauses and 
       conditions are used. It may be purchased in English and/or French, 
       from Canadian Government Publishing.  Copies of the Manual have also 
       been distributed to Canadian public libraries through the Depository 
       Services Program.

       An electronic version of the Manual is also available and contains 
       all of the information that is in the print version, as well as the 
       detailed text of previous versions of older clauses that have been 
       cancelled or superseded.

<strong>STRUCTURE</strong>

6.     The Manual has been organized to follow the progression of 
       information presented in procurement documents:

<strong>Section 1 - Standard Instructions and Conditions</strong>

7.     Previously printed on the reverse of page 1 of solicitations and 
       contracts, or included as attachments, these instructions and 
       conditions are now identified in standard clause A0000D at the 
       beginning of the clause section in procurement documents.

<strong>Section 2 - Forms</strong>

8.     This section contains forms commonly used in the procurement process. 
       Forms included are:

       (a)    Federal Contractors Program on Employment Equity - includes a 
              description of the program and Certificate of Commitment.

       (b)    Security Requirements Check List.

       (c)    Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments - DSS-MAS 9411.

       (d)    Information on Incumbent Employees

       The reader is directed to the specific clauses and/or conditions 
       which may be referred to in a procurement document. In certain cases, 
       the applicable certificates or forms have been reproduced for the 
       perusal and/or use of the reader.

<strong>Sections 3 and 4 - General Conditions and Supplemental General Conditions</strong>

9.     These sections present those sets of standard conditions which form 
       the foundation upon which all procurement documents issued by PWGSC 
       are built. Section 3 defines the basic sets of conditions which 
       apply to specific classes of contracts (e.g. DSS-MAS 1011A - General 
       Conditions - United States Purchases).  Section 4, Supplemental 
       General Conditions, addresses areas unique to specific sub-classes 
       of contracts (e.g. DSS-MAS 1028 - Supplemental General Conditions - 
       Ship Construction - Firm Price).

10.    Each section/article within a condition set has been given its own 
       effective date. The condition set as a whole has also been given an 
       effective date which is reflected in section 00 and is determined by 
       the latest revision date of one or more of its sections.

<strong>Section 5 - Standard Procurement Clauses</strong>

11.    This section contains a collection of national procurement clauses, 
       common to various classes of contracts. The full text of individual 
       clauses, incorporated by reference into a bid solicitation or 
       contract by their Number, Title and Effective Date, can be found in 
       this section of the Manual. Each subsection (A-Z) is devoted to a 
       particular subject area. Please note that some subsections have not 
       been assigned at this time.

12.    Clauses may be identified by their numbers which break down as 
       follows:

       (a)    the first alphabetic character (A-Z) indicates the subsection 
              in Section 5;

       (b)    the four numeric characters (0000-9999) indicate the clause's 
              position within the numeric sequence of the subsection;

       (c)    the final alphabetic character (T, C or D) indicates the type 
              of document in which a given clause would be used (i.e. T = 
              Tender; C = Contract; D = Dual purpose, used in both tenders 
              and contracts).

       Example:      Clause C0004T - Price Certification. This is the 
                     fourth sequential clause found in subsection C - Price, 
                     of Section 5 and is used in Tender (solicitation) 
                     documents.

<strong>Section 6 - Indexes</strong>

13.    <strong>Print Version (Index)</strong> - This section provides two indexes: Index by 
       Title and Index by Reference Number.

       <strong>PWGSC</strong> <strong>Smartext Version (Synopsis)</strong> - A synopsis of the changes made 
       since the last release is provided for each section. It can be 
       accessed through the "Outline Window".

<strong>USE OF THE MANUAL</strong>

<strong>Reference clauses (R)</strong>

14.    Bid solicitations and contracts will contain references to specific 
       clauses and general conditions which will apply to that particular 
       requirement. Clause references will include the clause number, its 
       effective date and its title (e.g. A0001T (01/06/91) Survey of 
       Facilities).  All clauses referred to in this manner can be found in 
       Section 5 of this Manual.

<strong>Fill-in clauses (F)</strong>

15.    Clauses which require the insertion of specific information by the 
       contracting officer or the supplier (fill-in clauses) will be 
       produced in full on procurement documents.

       <strong>NOTE</strong>:  In the case of discrepancies in clause versions between 
              solicitation documents and the Manual, any clause appearing 
              in full text in a procurement document will override any 
              version set out in the Manual.

<strong>Updates</strong>

16.    Any standard clause, and any condition or instruction set, used or 
       referenced in a bid solicitation or contract may be updated from 
       time to time. When this happens, the version used in an 
       already-issued document will remain in effect in that document, 
       unless the updated version is legally incorporated.
