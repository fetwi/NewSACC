Businesses, particularly those in Paulatuk, shall be given first
consideration where a Government Contract related to the Park may,
in accordance with the Government Contracts Regulations, be awarded
without competition.</li>
<li><span class="number">14.6</span> Prior to inviting bids by
public notice for Government Contracts related to the Park Canada
shall solicit bids from suppliers of goods and services, firstly
from with Paulatuk and secondly from within the Inuvialuit
Settlement Region (ISR). When soliciting bids:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">Canada shall make all reasonable attempts to award
contracts to qualified Inuvialuit Businesses according to the
measures outlined in this Section.</li>
<li value="2">Canada shall take all reasonable measures to determine if
there are Inuvialuit Businesses, particularly Inuvialuit businesses
located in Paulatuk, qualified to perform the contracts. This
determination will usually be made by reference to the list of
Inuvialuit Businesses provided by the Inuvialuit Regional
Corporation (IRC) and the Paulatuk Community Corporation (PCC).</li>
<li value="3">Where it is determined that a single Inuvialuit Business
within the <abbr title="Inuvialuit Settlement Region">ISR</abbr> is qualified to perform a particular contract,
Canada shall first solicit that business to submit a bid for that
contract. In accordance with the conditions set out in s. 14.1,
Canada shall make best efforts to award that contract to that
Inuvialuit Business upon the negotiation of acceptable terms and
conditions.</li>
<li value="4">Where Canada intends to solicit bids from more than one
qualified business within the <abbr title="Inuvialuit Settlement Region">ISR</abbr>, Canada shall take all reasonable
measures to determine if there are Inuvialuit Businesses qualified
to perform the contract, and shall solicit bids from those
Inuvialuit Businesses. This determination will usually be made by
reference to the list of Inuvialuit Businesses provided by the <abbr title="Inuvialuit Regional Corporation">IRC</abbr>

contract document contains appropriate terms and conditions to
ensure that sub-contractors are also subject to the intent and the
specific provisions of the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where, after considering known available suppliers including
those on the list of Inuvialuit Businesses, it is determined that
there are no qualified suppliers or where Bid Solicitation is
inconsistent with the <abbr title="Inuvialuit Final Agreement">IFA</abbr> and laws of general application, Canada
may proceed directly to Bid Invitation as set out in s. 14.7.</p>

submit bids, notwithstanding that one or more such businesses may
have submitted bids as part of the solicitation process. These
measures shall include the measures referred to in s. 14.3
