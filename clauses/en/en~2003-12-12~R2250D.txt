       obligations with respect to workers, to the Labour Conditions if 
       applicable, and that all lawful obligations towards Subcontractors 
       and suppliers in respect of the Work under the Contract have been 
       fully discharged.

       Among other things, the Statutory Declaration shall also clearly 
       identify the existence and condition of any disputed claims and 
       outstanding obligations.

2.     In order to discharge lawful obligations of and satisfy lawful 
       claims against the Contractor or a Subcontractor arising out of the 
       performance of the Work, Canada may

       (a)    pay an amount from money that is due and payable to the 
              Contractor pursuant to the Contract directly to the claimant 
              against the Contractor or the Subcontractor; or

       (b)    withhold from any amount that is due and payable to the 
              Contractor pursuant to the Contract the full amount of the 
              claim or any portion thereof.  Monies withheld for this 
              purpose shall not be subject to any interest payment in the 
              event such claims are rejected.

3.     The amount referred to in paragraph 2. (a) of GC 5.10 shall be that 
       amount which the Contractor would have been obliged to pay to such 
       claimant had the provisions of the Provincial or Territorial lien 
       legislation, or in the province of Quebec, the law relating to 
       mortgage, been applicable to the Work.  Any such claimant need not 
       comply with the provisions of such legislation setting out the steps 
       by way of notice, registration, or otherwise as might have been 
       necessary to preserve or perfect any claim for lien or mortgage 
       which the claimant might have had.

4.     For the purposes of GC 5.10 a claim shall be considered lawful when 
       it is so determined

       (a)    by a court of competent jurisdiction;
       (b)    by an arbitrator duly appointed to arbitrate the said claim; 
or
       (c)    by written notice delivered to the Departmental 
              Representative and signed by the Contractor authorizing 
              payment of the said claim(s).

5.     A payment made pursuant to subsection 2 of GC 5.10 is, to the extent 
       of the payment, a discharge of Canada's liability to the Contractor 
       under the Contract and may be deducted from any amount payable to 
       the Contractor under the Contract.

6.     Subsection 2 of GC 5.10 shall only apply to claims and obligations 
       where

       (a)    the notification of which has set forth the amount claimed to 
              be owing and the person who by Contract is primarily liable;
 
       (b)    the notification or a copy of the notification was received 
              by the Departmental Representative in writing before final 
              payment is made to the Contractor and within one hundred and 
              twenty (120) days of the date on which the claimant

              (i)    should have been paid in full under the claimant's 
                     Contract with the Contractor or Subcontractor where 
                     the claim is for money that was lawfully required to 
                     held back from the claimant; or

              (ii)   performed the last of the labour or furnished the last 
                     of the Plant or Material pursuant to the claimant's 
                     Contract with the Contractor or Subcontractor where 
                     the claim is not for money referred to in subparagraph 
                     6. (b)(i) of GC 5.10; and

       (c)    the proceedings to determine the right to payment for the 
              claim shall have commenced within one year from the date that 
              the notice referred to in paragraph 6. (b) of GC 5.10 was 
              received by the Department Representative.

7.     The Departmental Representative shall inform the Contractor in 
       writing of receipt of any notification of claim and of the intention 
       of Canada to withhold funds pursuant to subsection 2 of GC 5.10.  
       The Contractor may, at any time thereafter and until payment is made 
       to the claimant, post with Canada, security in the form of a 
       Claimant's Payment Bond acceptable to Canada and in an amount equal 
       to the value of the said claim.  Upon receipt of such security 
       Canada shall release to the Contractor any funds which would be 
       otherwise payable to the Contractor, that were withheld pursuant to 
       the provisions of subsection 2 of GC 5.10.
