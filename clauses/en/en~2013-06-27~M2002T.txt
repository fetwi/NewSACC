<p>
  Clause M2002T is cancelled because it has been replaced by a Mandatory Certification, see Part 5 - Certifications, Part 7 -  Standing Offer and Resulting Contract Clauses and a new Annex titled Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity - Certification of the Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) Template, to be used for requirements where an individual call-up limitation at $1M and above will be allowed.  This certification is mandatory for Departments or Agencies which are subject to the Federal Contractors Program (FCP).

<p>
  Background - In June 2013, a streamlined
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  for employment equity was introduced which changed the obligations of both Offerors and Standing Offer Authorities in the application of the program.   The threshold for the application of the
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  has been increased to $1M for an offeror, subject to the program, meaning that where a call-up limitation of $1M and above will be allowed, to have an Agreement to Implement Employment Equity (AIEE) in place with
  <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">
   HRSDC
  </abbr>
  -Labour.  Once an offeror, subject to the program, is issued a standing offer with a call-up limitation of $1M or more, it must honour the
  <abbr title="Agreement to Implement Employment Equity">
   AIEE
  </abbr>
  as an on-going obligation and not simply for the period of the standing offer.  Offerors who do not comply with the
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  or if their
  <abbr title="Agreement to Implement Employment Equity">
   AIEE
  </abbr>
  becomes invalid will be declared ineligible by
  <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">
   HRSDC
  </abbr>
  -Labour and their names will appear on the "
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  Limited Eligibility to Bid" list.  In addition, an ineligible offeror should not be issued future standing offers or awarded future contracts,
  <strong>
   regardless of the value
  </strong>
  of the procurement.
