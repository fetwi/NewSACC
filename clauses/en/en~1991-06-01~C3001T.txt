<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>This clause is to be used in all negotiated firm-price bid solicitation 
documents for non-commercial goods and services with an anticipated foreign 
currency component in bids which are expected to result in purchase orders or 
contracts in excess of $5,000.  Purchase orders or contracts awarded as a result 
of telephone buys are exempted.  See SPM Directive 4101 which details several 
exceptions.  When using this clause, a table specifying the conversion rates for 
the anticipated foreign currencies is to be included in the bid solicitation 
document.  If the bid solicitation documents are to be sent to Canadian-based 
suppliers only, paragraphs 3.b), 4.c), and 5.b) are to be deleted.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.  The price(s) quoted by Canadian-based suppliers shall be quoted and 
payable in Canadian funds.  The option rests with foreign-based bidders to 
quote in Canadian or foreign currency.  If quoted in Canadian currency, the 
price shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 2 below.

2.  The price shall be adjusted either upwards or downwards to reflect the 
actual costs incurred with respect to the fluctuations in the exchange rate 
and their effect on the foreign currency component.

3.  The foreign currency component is defined as the element of the price 
which will be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.

       a)  For Canadian-based contractors, it includes the duty-paid value 
       (value in Canadian funds of the foreign component including customs 
       duty) plus goods and services tax and excise taxes of an ad valorem 
       nature, as well as transportation costs payable in foreign currency.

       b)  For foreign-based contractors, it excludes customs duty, goods 
       and services tax and excise taxes of an ad valorem nature, but 
       includes transportation costs payable in foreign currency.

4.  The foreign currency component(s) subject to adjustments reflect(s) the 
goods and services purchased:

(  ) a) by Canadian contractors from outside Canada with payment in
       a foreign currency; or

(  ) b) from authorized Canadian agents but paid for in foreign
       currency; or

(  ) c) from a foreign contractor with payment in Canadian funds.

(Check one of the above as applicable.)

The applicable conversion factors are as detailed in form DSS-MAS 9411,  
Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments, which will form part of any resultant 
Contract.

5.  Price adjustments with respect to foreign currency fluctuations will be 
based upon the value of the foreign currency component in foreign funds 
(see section A of form DSS-MAS 9411) with appropriate adjustments to 
reflect the actual rate obtained as opposed to the rate specified at 
section B of the form.  Such increases or decreases in the rate shall be 
based on the following criteria:

       a) for Canadian-based suppliers, on the date payment(s) to the 
       Contractor's foreign supplier is(are) effected, provided such 
       payment(s) is(are) made within thirty (30) calendar days after the 
       date of importation and the date of importation is prior to the 
       delivery date specified in the Contract.  If payment to the 
       Contractor's supplier is not made within thirty (30) calendar days 
       after the date of importation, Canada may select the rate most 
       advantageous to it within the 30-day period after importation. 
       However, in the case of importations made after the specified 
       delivery date, Canada will select the rate most advantageous to it 
       within the 30-day period after the specified delivery date;

       b) for foreign-based suppliers, the rate(s) prevailing on the date 
       of payment(s) by Canada will apply, provided delivery is made on or 
       before the delivery date specified in the Contract. In case of 
       delivery made after the specified delivery date, Canada will select 
       the exchange rate most advantageous to it within the 30-day period 
       after the specified delivery date.

6.  For Canadian-based suppliers, the Minister shall have the right to 
   audit any revision to costs under this clause.
