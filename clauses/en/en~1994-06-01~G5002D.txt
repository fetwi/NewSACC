<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in ship repair contractual documents where: (1) a 
general contractor (e.g., welding specialist) is expected to perform casual and 
intermittent work on vessels owned by Canada, in addition to its more usual 
land-based type of work; or, (2) a standing offer.

If either the procurement officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $5,000,000 per accident or occurrence is not 
sufficient, the suggested limit should be established in consultation with DSS's 
Risk Management and Insurance Advisor..

When this clause is used, include clause G2010D in the contractual documents.
