<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     It is a term of the Standing Offer:

       (a)    that the Offeror has declared to the Standing Offer Authority 
              whether the Offeror has received a lump sum payment made 
              pursuant to any work force reduction program, including but 
              not limited to the Work Force Adjustment Directive, the Early 
              Departure Incentive Program, the Early Retirement Incentive 
              Program or the Executive Employment Transition  Program, 
              which has been implemented to reduce the public service;

       (b)    that the Offeror has informed the Standing Offer Authority of 
              the terms and conditions of that work force reduction program, 
              pursuant to which the Offeror was made a lump sum payment, 
              including the termination date, the amount of the lump sum 
              payment and the rate of pay on which the lump sum payment was 
              based; and

       (c)    that the Offeror has informed the Standing Offer Authority of 
              any exemption in respect of the abatement of a contract fee 
              received by the Offeror under the Early Departure Incentive 
              Program Order or paragraph 4 of Policy Notice 1995-8, of July 
              28, 1995.

2.     The Offeror represents and warrants that the information submitted 
       with its offer is accurate and complete.  The Offeror acknowledges 
       that Canada has relied upon such representation to issue the 
       Standing Offer.  Such representation may be verified in such manner 
       as Canada may reasonably require.

3.     The Offeror acknowledges that in the event of a breach of such 
       covenant, Canada will have the right to terminate any contract 
       resulting from the Standing Offer and set aside the Standing Offer. 

4.     Nothing in this clause must be interpreted as limiting the rights 
   and remedies which Canada may otherwise have in relation to or pursuant 
   to any contract resulting from the Standing Offer.
