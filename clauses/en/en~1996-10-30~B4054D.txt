<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor shall within &lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt; day of the effective date of the 
       Contract, contact &lt;&lt;2&gt;&gt; by telephone at (   )___-____ to arrange an 
       Initial Provisioning Conference (IPC) to be held at the Contractor's 
       facility. The cost per day for an IPC shall be included in the &lt;&lt;3&gt;&gt; 
       price.

2.     The purpose of the IPC is:

       (a)    if a Provisioning Parts Breakdown (PPB) has been included in 
              the contract, to allow Canada to verify that the PPB reflects 
              the current and complete configuration of the equipment being 
              procured by comparing it to full assembly drawings; and

       (b)    if a PPB has not been included in the contract, to select the 
              spares required to support the deliverable end items during 
              an initial period of service.

3.     The Contractor shall have available:

       (a)    a suitable conference room;

       (b)    engineering and product support assistance;

       (c)    equipment for a physical examination, if practicable;

       (d)    engineering, reliability and maintainability data;

       (e)    modification data, if applicable;

       (f)    Supplementary Provisioning Technical Documentation (SPTD) as 
              defined in the current issue of Canadian Forces Specification 
              D-01-100-214/SF-000.

4.     Canada's provisioning representation would normally consist of five 
       representatives from the technical and logistic areas.

5.     The Contractor may still be required to provide logistic and 
       engineering clarification or assistance and shall be required to 
       provide SPTD should it subsequently be decided that a provisioning 
       conference is not necessary.
