<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause when the term "Technical Authority" is  to be included 
in the contract (as requested by the client department).  If the term "Project 
Authority" is to be used instead, refer to clause A1022C.  If both terms 
"Technical Authority" and "Project Authority" are required in the contract, 
contracting officers must revise the responsibilities of both authorities to 
reflect their respective roles.

For Low Dollar Value and Medium Complexity requirements if the Plain Language 
templates 2T-LDV1 and 2T-MED1 are used, insert this clause, if applicable, in 
the Resulting Contract Part, under "Authorities".
