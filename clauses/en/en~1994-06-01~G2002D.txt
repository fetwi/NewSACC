<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>The contractor must have Errors and Omissions Liability (also known as 
Professional Liability) insurance coverage where professional expertise (e.g., 
consultants, accountants, architects) is a requirement of the contract and the 
nature of the contract introduces a reasonable element of risk to Canada or 
other third parties.

If either the procurement officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $1,000,000 per accident or occurrence is not 
sufficient, the suggested limit should be established in consultation with the 
client  concerned and DSS's Risk Management and Insurance Advisor.
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Errors and Omissions Liability insurance shall be effected by the

in an amount usual for a contract of this nature, but, in any case, for a 
limit of liability NOT LESS THAN $1,000,000 per accident or occurrence.
