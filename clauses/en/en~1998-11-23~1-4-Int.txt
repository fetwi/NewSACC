<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Supplemental General Conditions are used in conjunction with one of the 
General Condition sets in Section 3. Their purpose is to expand upon and 
clarify specific points within the context of an identified subject area. 
For example, Supplemental General Conditions DSS-MAS 1028 - Ship 
Construction - Firm Price, expands upon the topic of ship construction.

Prior to the introduction of the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and 
Conditions</em> Manual, Supplemental General Condition sets were attached to 
each bid solicitation package.  This practice has been replaced by 
incorporation by reference. The specified Supplemental General Conditions 
specified in standard clause K0000D form part of the procurement document.

To improve readability, each condition set includes an index section 
(article) - 00, which details the various subjects covered within the 
condition set. As well, each section has an effective date. As conditions 
are updated and modified, only the affected section will receive a new 
effective date, corresponding to the effective date for the whole condition 
set; thus making changes more readily identifiable by users.

The following list identifies those sets of Supplemental General Conditions 
which are currently in use by the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services, their latest revision date and their title.
