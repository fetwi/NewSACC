<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in combination with DSS-MAS 9676, "General Conditions - 
Services" or DSS-MAS 9601, "General Conditions - Long Form", in a Contract which 
does not involve any research and development, where it is anticipated that the 
intellectual property arising from the Work under the Contract, if any, will be 
minimal, where the client has specified that the intellectual property rights 
are to vest in the contractor and where the Crown does not wish to have any 
license to use any intellectual property that may arise in the Contractor's 
performance of the Contract.

Do not use this clause in conjunction with DSS-MAS 9624, "General Conditions - 
Research and Development".  Clause K3030D may be used in combination with this 
clause where material subject to copyright protection will be created in the 
performance of the Contract and the client department wishes to ensure that it 
obtains a license to exercise all rights comprised in the copyright in that 
material, but does not require a license to exercise any other intellectual 
property rights arising from the Work under the Contract.

       relate to information or data supplied by Canada for purposes of the 
       Contract, all intellectual property rights in anything conceived, 
       developed, reduced to practice or produced as part of the Work under

       vest in and remain the property of the Contractor."
