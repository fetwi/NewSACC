35.2   If the contractor incurs or sustains any extra expense or any loss 
       or damage that is directly attributable to

       35.2.1 a substantial difference between the information relating to 
              soil conditions at the <em>work</em> site that is contained in the 
              Plans and Specifications or other documents supplied to the 
              contractor for use in preparing the contractor's tender or a 
              reasonable assumption of fact based thereon made by the 
              contractor, and the actual soil conditions encountered by the 
              contractor at the <em>work</em> site during the performance of the <em>
              contract</em>, or

       35.2.2 any neglect or delay that occurs after the date of the <em>
              contract</em> on the part of Her Majesty in providing any 
              information or in doing any act that the <em>contract</em> either 
              expressly requires Her Majesty to do or that would ordinarily 
              be done by an owner in accordance with the usage of the trade,

       the contractor shall, within ten days of the date the actual soil 
       conditions described in GC35.2.1 were encountered or the neglect or 
       delay described in GC35.2.2 occurred, give the <em>Engineer</em> written 
       notice of intention to claim for that extra expense or that loss or 
       damage.

35.3   When the contractor has given a notice referred to in GC35.2, the 
       contractor shall give the <em>Engineer</em> a written claim for extra expense 
       or loss or damage within 30 days of the date that a Final 
       Certificate of Completion referred to in GC44.1 is issued and not 
       afterwards.

35.4   A written claim referred to in GC35.3 shall contain a sufficient 
       description of the facts and circumstances of the occurrence that is 
       the subject of the claim to enable the <em>Engineer</em> to determine whether 
       or not the claim is justified and the contractor shall supply such 
       further and other information for that purpose as the <em>Engineer</em> 
       requires from time to time. 
35.5   If the <em>Engineer</em> determines that a claim referred to in GC35.3 is 
       justified, Her Majesty shall make an extra payment to the contractor 
       in an amount that is calculated in accordance with GC47 to GC50.

35.6   If, in the opinion of the <em>Engineer</em>, an occurrence described in GC35.2.1 
       results in a savings of expenditure by the contractor in performing 
       the <em>contract</em>, the amount set out in the Articles of Agreement shall, 
       subject to GC35.7, be reduced by an amount that is equal to the 
       saving.

35.7   The amount of the saving referred to in GC35.6 shall be determined 
       in accordance with GC47 to GC50.

35.8   If the contractor fails to give a notice referred to in GC35.2 and a 
       claim referred to in GC35.3 within the times stipulated, an extra 
       payment shall not be made to the contractor in respect of the 
       occurrence.

<strong>GC36   (01/10/94)    Extension of Time</strong>

36.1   Subject to GC36.2, the <em>Engineer</em> may, on the application of the 
       contractor made before the day fixed by the Articles of Agreement 
       for completion of the <em>work</em> or before any other date previously fixed 
       under this General Condition, extend the time for its completion by 
       fixing a new date if, in the opinion of the <em>Engineer</em>, causes beyond 
       the control of the contractor have delayed its completion.

36.2   An application referred to in GC36.1 shall be accompanied by the 
       written consent of the bonding company whose bond forms part of the <em>
       contract security</em>.

<strong>GC37   (01/10/94)    Assessments and Damages for Late Completion</strong>

37.1   For the purposes of this General Condition

       37.1.1 the <em>work</em> shall be deemed to be completed on the date that an 
              Interim Certificate of Completion referred to in GC44.2 is 
              issued, and

       37.1.2 "period of delay" means the number of days commencing on the 
              day fixed by the Articles of Agreement for completion of the <em>
              work</em> and ending on the day immediately preceding the day on 
              which the <em>work</em> is completed but does not include any day 
              within a period of extension granted pursuant to GC36.1, and 
              any other day on which, in the opinion of the <em>Engineer</em>, 
              completion of the <em>work</em> was delayed for reasons beyond the 
              control of the contractor.

37.2   If the contractor does not complete the <em>work</em> by the day fixed for 
       its completion by the Articles of Agreement but completes it 
       thereafter, the contractor shall pay Her Majesty an amount equal to 
       the aggregate of

       37.2.1 all salaries, wages and travelling expenses incurred by Her 
              Majesty in respect of persons overseeing the performance of 
              the <em>work</em> during the period of delay;

       37.2.2 the cost incurred by Her Majesty as a result of the inability 
              to use the completed <em>work</em> for the period of delay; and

       37.2.3 all other expenses and damages incurred or sustained by Her 
              Majesty during the period of delay as a result of the <em>work</em> 
              not being completed by the day fixed for its completion.

37.3   The <em>Minister</em> may waive the right of Her Majesty to the whole or any 
       part of the amount payable by the contractor pursuant to GC37.2 if, 
       in the opinion of the <em>Minister</em>, it is in the public interest to do 
       so. 
<strong>GC38   (01/01/96)    Taking the Work Out of the Contractor's Hands</strong>

38.1   The <em>Minister</em> may, at the <em>Minister</em>'s sole discretion, by giving a 
       notice in writing to the contractor in accordance with GC11, take 
       all or any part of the <em>work</em> out of the contractor's hands, and may 
       employ such means as the <em>Minister</em> sees fit to have the <em>work</em> 
       completed if the contractor

       38.1.1 has not, within six days of the <em>Minister</em> or the <em>Engineer</em> 
              giving notice to the contractor in writing in accordance with 
              GC11, remedied any delay in the commencement or any default 
              in the diligent performance of the <em>work</em> to the satisfaction 
              of the <em>Engineer</em>;

       38.1.2 has defaulted in the completion of any part of the <em>work</em> 
              within the time fixed for its completion by the <em>contract</em>;

       38.1.3 has become insolvent or has committed an act of bankruptcy, 
              and has neither made a proposal to its creditors nor filed a 
              notice of intention to make such a proposal, pursuant to the <em>
              Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>; 

       38.1.4 has abandoned the <em>work</em>;

       38.1.5 has made an assignment of the <em>contract</em> without the consent 
              required by GC3.1; or

       38.1.6 has otherwise failed to observe or perform any of the 
              provisions of the <em>contract</em>.

38.2   If the contractor has become insolvent or has committed an act of 
       bankruptcy, and has either made a proposal to its creditors or filed 
       a notice of intention to make such a proposal, pursuant to the <em>
       Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, the contractor shall immediately 
       forward a copy of the proposal or the notice of intention to Her 
       Majesty.

38.3   If the whole or any part of the <em>work</em> is taken out of the contractor'
       s hands pursuant to GC38.1,

       38.3.1 the contractor's right to any further payment that is due or 
              accruing due under the <em>contract</em> is, subject only to GC38.5, 
              extinguished, and

       38.3.2 the contractor is liable to pay Her Majesty, upon demand, an 
              amount that is equal to the amount of all loss and damage 
              incurred or sustained by Her Majesty in respect of the 
              contractor's failure to complete the <em>work</em>.

38.4   If the whole or any part of the <em>work</em> that is taken out of the 
       contractor's hands pursuant to GC38.1 is completed by Her Majesty, 
       the <em>Engineer</em> shall determine the amount, if any, of the holdback or 
       a progress claim that had accrued and was due prior to the date on 
       which the <em>work</em> was taken out of the contractor's hands and that is 
       not required for the purposes of having the <em>work</em> performed or of 
       compensating Her Majesty for any other loss or damage incurred or 
       sustained by reason of the contractor's default.

38.5   Her Majesty may pay the contractor the amount determined not to be 
       required pursuant to GC38.4.

<strong>GC39   (01/10/94)    Effect of Taking the Work Out of the Contractor's 
Hands</strong>

39.1   The taking of the <em>work</em> or any part thereof out of the contractor's 
       hands pursuant to GC38 does not operate so as to relieve or 
       discharge the contractor from any obligation under the <em>contract</em> or 
       imposed upon him by law except the obligation to complete the 
       performance of that part of the <em>work</em> that was taken out of the 
       contractor's hands.
 
39.2   If the <em>work</em> or any part thereof is taken out of the contractor's 
       hands pursuant to GC38, all <em>plant</em> and <em>material</em> and the interest of 
       the contractor in all real property, licences, powers and privileges 
       acquired, used or provided by the contractor under the <em>contract</em> 
       shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty without 
       compensation to the contractor.

39.3   When the <em>Engineer</em> certifies that any <em>plant</em>, <em>material</em>, or any 
       interest of the contractor referred to in GC39.2 is no longer 
       required for the purposes of the <em>work</em>, or that it is not in the 
       interests of Her Majesty to retain that <em>plant</em>, <em>material</em>, or interest, 
       it shall revert to the contractor.

<strong>GC40   (01/10/94)    Suspension of Work by Minister</strong>

40.1   The <em>Minister</em> may, when in the <em>Minister</em>'s opinion it is in the public 
       interest to do so, require the contractor to suspend performance of 
       the <em>work</em> either for a specified or an unspecified period by giving a 
       notice of suspension in writing to the contractor in accordance with 
       GC11.

40.2   When a notice referred to in GC40.1 is received by the contractor in 
       accordance with GC11, the contractor shall suspend all operations in 
       respect of the <em>work</em> except those that, in the opinion of the <em>
       Engineer</em>, are necessary for the care and preservation of the <em>work</em>, <em>
       plant</em> and <em>material</em>.

40.3   The contractor shall not, during a period of suspension, remove any 
       part of the <em>work</em>, <em>plant</em> or <em>material</em> from its site without the 
       consent of the <em>Engineer</em>.

40.4   If a period of suspension is 30 days or less, the contractor shall, 
       upon the expiration of that period, resume the performance of the <em>
       work</em> and the contractor is entitled to be paid the extra cost, 
       calculated in accordance with GC48 to GC50, of any labour, <em>plant</em> and <em>
       material</em> necessarily incurred by the contractor as a result of the 
       suspension.

40.5   If, upon the expiration of a period of suspension of more than 30 
       days, the <em>Minister</em> and the contractor agree that the performance of 
       the <em>work</em> will be continued by the contractor, the contractor shall 
       resume performance of the <em>work</em> subject to any terms and conditions 
       agreed upon by the <em>Minister</em> and the contractor.

40.6   If, upon the expiration of a period of suspension of more than 30 
       days, the <em>Minister</em> and the contractor do not agree that performance 
       of the <em>work</em> will be continued by the contractor or upon the terms 
       and conditions under which the contractor will continue the <em>work</em>, 
       the notice of suspension shall be deemed to be a notice of 
       termination pursuant to GC41.

<strong>GC41   (01/10/94)    Termination of Contract</strong>

41.1   The <em>Minister</em> may terminate the <em>contract</em> at any time by giving a 
       notice of termination in writing to the contractor in accordance 
       with GC11.

41.2   When a notice referred to in GC41.1 is received by the contractor in 
       accordance with GC11, the contractor shall, subject to any 
       conditions stipulated in the notice, forthwith cease all operations 
       in performance of the <em>contract</em>.

41.3   If the <em>contract</em> is terminated pursuant to GC41.1, Her Majesty shall 
       pay the contractor, subject to GC41.4, an amount equal to

       41.3.1 the cost to the contractor of all labour, <em>plant</em> and <em>material</em> 
              supplied by the contractor under the <em>contract</em> up to the date 
              of termination in respect of a <em>contract</em> or part thereof for 
              which a Unit Price Arrangement is stipulated in the <em>contract</em>, 
              or

       41.3.2 the lesser of 
              41.3.2.1      an amount, calculated in accordance with the 
                            Terms and Payment, that would have been payable 
                            to the contractor had the contractor completed 
                            the <em>work</em>, and

              41.3.2.2      an amount that is determined to be due to the 
                            contractor pursuant to GC49 in respect of a <em>
                            contract</em> or part thereof for which a Fixed 
                            Price Arrangement is stipulated in the <em>contract</em>

       less the aggregate of all amount that were paid to the contractor by 
       Her Majesty and all amounts that are due to Her Majesty from the 
       contractor pursuant to the <em>contract</em>.

41.4   If Her Majesty and the contractor are unable to agree about an 
       amount referred to in GC41.3 that amount shall be determined by the 
       method referred to in GC50.

<strong>GC42   (01/10/94)    Claims Against and Obligations of the Contractor or 
                     Subcontractor</strong>

42.1   Her Majesty may, in order to discharge lawful obligations of and 
       satisfy claims against the contractor or a <em>subcontractor</em> arising out 
       of the performance of the <em>contract</em>, pay any amount that is due and 
       payable to the contractor pursuant to the <em>contract</em> directly to the 
       obligees of and the claimants against the contractor or the <em>
       subcontractor</em> but such amount if any, as is paid by Her Majesty 
       shall not exceed that amount which the contractor would have been 
       obliged to pay to such claimant had the provisions of the Provincial 
       or Territorial lien legislation, or, in the Province of Quebec, the 
       law relating to privileges, been applicable to the <em>work</em>.  Any such 
       claimant need not comply with the provisions of such legislation 
       setting out the steps by way of notice, registration or otherwise as 
       might have been necessary to preserve or perfect any claim for lien 
       or privilege which claimant might have had.

42.2   Her Majesty will not make any payment as described in GC42.1 unless 
       and until that claimant shall have delivered to Her Majesty:

       42.2.1 a binding and enforceable Judgment or Order of a court of 
              competent jurisdiction setting forth such amount as would 
              have been payable by the contractor to the claimant pursuant 
              to the provisions of the applicable Provincial or Territorial 
              lien legislation, or, in the Province of Quebec, the law 
              relating to privileges, had such legislation been applicable 
              to the <em>work</em>; or

       42.2.2 a final and enforceable award of an arbitrator setting forth 
              such amount as would have been payable by the contractor to 
              the claimant pursuant to the provisions of the applicable 
              Provincial or Territorial lien legislation, or, in the 
              Province of Quebec, the law relating to privileges, had such 
              legislation been applicable to the <em>work</em>; or

       42.2.3 the consent of the contractor authorizing a payment.

       For the purposes of determining the entitlement of a claimant 
       pursuant to GC42.2.1 and GC42.2.2, the notice required by GC42.8 
       shall be deemed to replace the registration or provision of notice 
       after the performance of <em>work</em> as required by any applicable 
       legislation and no claim shall be deemed to have expired, become 
       void or unenforceable by reason of the claimant not commencing any 
       action within the time prescribed by any applicable legislation.

42.3   The contractor shall, by the execution of this <em>contract</em>, be deemed 
       to have consented to submit to binding arbitration at the request of 
       any claimant those questions that need be answered to establish the 
       entitlement of the claimant to payment pursuant to the provisions of 
       GC42.1 and such arbitration shall have as parties to it any <em>
       subcontractor</em> to whom the claimant supplied <em>material</em>, performed <em>work</em> 
       or rented equipment should such <em>subcontractor</em> wish to be adjoined 
       and the Crown shall not be a party to such arbitration and, subject 
       to any agreement between the contractor and the claimant to the 
       contrary, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the 
       Provincial or Territorial legislation governing arbitration 
       applicable in the Province or Territory in which the <em>work</em> is located.

42.4   A payment made pursuant to GC42.1 is, to the extent of the payment, 
       a discharge of Her Majesty's liability to the contractor under the <em>
       contract</em> and may be deducted from any amount payable to the 
       contractor under the <em>contract</em>.

42.5   To the extent that the circumstances of the <em>work</em> being performed for 
       Her Majesty permit, the contractor shall comply with all laws in 
       force in the Province or Territory where the <em>work</em> is being performed 
       relating to payment period, mandatory holdbacks, and creation and 
       enforcement of mechanics' liens, builders' liens or similar 
       legislation or in the Province of Quebec, the law relating to 
       privileges.

42.6   The contractor shall discharge all the contractor's lawful 
       obligations and shall satisfy all lawful claims against the 
       contractor arising out of the performance of the <em>work</em> at least as 
       often as the <em>contract</em> requires Her Majesty to pay the contractor.

42.7   The contractor shall, whenever requested to do so by the <em>Engineer</em>, 
       make a statutory declaration deposing to the existence and condition 
       of any obligations and claims referred to in GC42.6.

42.8   GC42.1 shall only apply to claims and obligations

       42.8.1 the notification of which has been received by the <em>Engineer</em> 
              in writing before payment is made to the contractor pursuant 
              to TP4.10 and within 120 days of the date on which the 
              claimant

              42.8.1.1      should have been paid in full under the 
                            claimant's <em>contract</em> with the contractor or <em>
                            subcontractor</em> where the claim is for money that 
                            was lawfully required to be held back from the 
                            claimant; or

              42.8.1.2      performed the last of the services, <em>work</em> or 
                            labour, or furnished the last of the <em>material</em> 
                            pursuant to the claimant's <em>contract</em> with the 
                            contractor or <em>subcontractor</em> where the claim is 
                            not for money referred to in GC42.8.1.1, and

       42.8.2 the proceedings to determine the right to payment of which, 
              pursuant to GC42.2, shall have commenced within one year from 
              the date that the notice referred to in GC42.8.1 was received 
              by the <em>Engineer</em>, and

       the notification required by GC42.8.1 shall set forth the amount 
       claimed to be owing and the <em>person</em> who by contract is primarily 
       liable.

42.9   Her Majesty may, upon receipt of a notice of claim under GC42.8.1, 
       withhold from any amount that is due and payable to the contractor 
       pursuant to the <em>contract</em> the full amount of the claim or any portion 
       thereof.

42.10  The <em>Engineer</em> shall notify the contractor in writing of receipt of 
       any claim referred to in GC42.8.1 and of the intention of Her 
       Majesty to withhold funds pursuant to GC42.9 and the contractor may, 
       at any time thereafter and until payment is made to the claimant, be 
       entitled to post, with Her Majesty, security in a form acceptable to 
       Her Majesty in an amount equal to the value of the claim, the notice 
       of which is received by the <em>Engineer</em> and upon receipt of such 
       security Her Majesty shall release to the contractor any funds which 
       would be otherwise payable to the contractor, that were withheld 
       pursuant to the provisions of GC42.9 in respect of the claim of any 
       claimant for whom the security stands.

       43.1.1 the <em>work</em> is taken out of the contractor's hands pursuant to 
              GC38,

       43.1.2 the <em>contract</em> is terminated pursuant to GC41, or

       43.1.3 the contractor is in breach of or in default under the <em>
              contract</em>,

       Her Majesty may convert the security deposit, if any, to Her own use.

43.2   If Her Majesty converts the <em>contract security</em> pursuant to GC43.1, 
       the amount realized shall be deemed to be an amount due from Her 
       Majesty to the contractor under the <em>contract</em>.

43.3   Any balance of an amount referred to in GC43.2 that remains after 
       payment of all losses, damage and claims of Her Majesty and others 
       shall be paid by Her Majesty to the contractor if, in the opinion of

              and directions made pursuant thereto,

       both to the satisfaction of the <em>Engineer</em>, the <em>Engineer</em> shall issue a

       the <em>Engineer</em> shall, at any time before issuing a certificate 
       referred to in GC44.1, issue an Interim Certificate of Completion to

       44.2.1 for the purposes of GC44.2 the <em>work</em> will be considered to be 
              substantially complete,

              44.2.1.1      when the <em>work</em> under the <em>contract</em> or a

              of the value of the <em>contract</em> at the time this cost is 
calculated.
 
44.3   For the sole purpose of GC44.2.1.2, where the <em>work</em> or a substantial

       intended and the remainder of the <em>work</em> or a part thereof cannot be 
       completed by the time specified in A2.1, or as amended pursuant to 
       GC36, for reasons beyond the control of the contractor or where the <em>

       within the specified time, the cost of that part of the <em>work</em> which 
       was either beyond the control of the contractor to complete or the <em>
       Engineer</em> and the contractor have agreed not to complete by the time 
       specified shall be deducted from the value of the <em>contract</em> referred 
       to GC44.2.1.2 and the said cost shall not form part of the cost of

       to the <em>Engineer</em>'s satisfaction and to do any other things that are 
       necessary for the satisfactory completion of the <em>work</em>.

       thereof the <em>Engineer</em> and the contractor may, by an agreement in 
       writing,

       47.1.1 add classes of labour, <em>plant</em> or <em>material</em>, and units of 
              measurement, prices per unit and estimated quantities to the 
              Unit Price Table if any labour, <em>plant</em> or <em>material</em> that is to 
              be included in the Final Certificate of Measurement referred 
              to in GC44.8 is not included in any class of labour, <em>plant</em> or <em>
              material</em> set out in the Unit Price Table; or

       47.1.2 subject to GC47.2 and GC47.3, amend a price per unit set out 
              in the Unit Price Table for any class of labour, <em>plant</em> or <em>
              material</em> included therein if the Final Certificate of 
              Measurement referred to in GC44.8 shows or is expected to 
              show that the total quantity of that class of labour, <em>plant</em> 
              or <em>material</em> actually performed, used or supplied by the 
              contractor in performing the <em>work</em> is

              47.1.2.1 less than 85% of that estimated total quantity, or

              47.1.2.2 in excess of 115% of that estimated total quantity.

47.2   In no event shall the total cost of an item set out in the Unit 
       Price Table that has been amended pursuant to GC47.1.2.1 exceed the 
       amount that would have been payable to the contractor had the 
       estimated total quantity actually been performed, used or supplied.

47.3   An amendment that is made necessary by GC47.1.2.2 shall apply only 
       to the quantities that are in excess of 115%.

47.4   If the <em>Engineer</em> and the contractor do not agree as contemplated in 
       GC47.1, the <em>Engineer</em> shall determine the class and the unit of 
       measurement of the labour, <em>plant</em> or <em>material</em> and, subject to GC47.2 
       and GC47.3, the price per unit therefor shall be determined in 
       accordance with GC50.

<strong>GC48   ( 01/10/94)   Determination of Cost - Unit Price Table</strong>

48.1   Whenever, for the purposes of the <em>contract</em> it is necessary to 
       determine the cost of labour, <em>plant</em> or <em>material</em>, it shall be 
       determined by multiplying the quantity of that labour, <em>plant</em> or <em>
       material</em> expressed in the unit set out in column 3 of the Unit Price 
       Table by the price of that unit set out in column 5 of the Unit 
       Price Table.

<strong>GC49   (12/05/00)    Determination of Cost Prior to Undertaking Work - Lump 
       Sum</strong>

49.1   If the method described in GC48 cannot be used because the labour, 
       plant and material is of a kind or class that is not set out in the 
       Unit Price Table then, for the purposes of the contract, the price 
       of the change shall be the aggregate costs of all labour, plant and 
       material that is required for the change as agreed upon by the 
       Contractor and the Engineer plus a mark-up for all supervision, 
       coordination, administration, overhead, margin and the risk of 
       undertaking the work within the stipulated amount, which mark-up 
       shall be equal to

       49.1.1        20% of the aggregate costs referred to herein for that 
                     portion of the Work done by the Contractor's own 
                     forces; and

       49.1.2        15% of the aggregate costs referred to herein for that 
                     portion of the Work that is done by subcontract.

49.2   Subject to similar provisions expressed elsewhere in the contract, 
       in order to facilitate approval of the change, the Contractor shall 
       submit a cost breakdown identifying, as a minimum, the cost of 
       labour, plant, material, each subcontract amount and the amount of 
       the appropriate percentage mark-up as described herein.

<strong>GC50   (12/05/00)    Determination of Cost Following Completion of Work</strong>

50.1   Where it is not possible to predetermine the price of a change, 
       including elements not set out in the Unit Price Table, the actual 
       price of the change shall be equal to the aggregate costs of

       50.1.1        all reasonable and proper amounts actually expended or 
                     legally payable by the Contractor in respect of the 
                     labour, plant and material that falls within one of 
                     the classes of expenditure described in GC50.2 that 
                     are directly attributable to the performance of the 
                     contract;

       50.1.2        a mark-up equal to 10% of the amounts referred to in

                     accordance with TP9,

       provided that the total cost of an item set out in the Unit Price 
       Table that is subject to the provisions of GC47.1.2.1 does not 
       exceed the amount that would have been payable to the Contractor had 
       the Estimated Total Quantity of the said item actually been 
       performed, used or supplied.

              equivalent amount is reasonable and use of that plant has 
              been approved by the Engineer;

       50.2.5 payment for maintenance and operating the plant necessary for 
              and used in the performance of the work, and payments for
