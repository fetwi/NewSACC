<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause when limiting a Contractor's liability to the Crown for 
first and third party claims.  Limiting a contractor's liability to the Crown 
should be an exception to the normal practice of using the standard terms and 
conditions.  Limiting a Contractor's liability to the Crown for third party 
claims should be avoided at all costs, as the exposure of risk to the Crown 
could be astronomical.  Limiting a contractor's third party liability can only 
be done under a very limited number of circumstances, the main one being sole 
source contracts.

When the decision is made to limit a Contractor's liability to the Crown, 
contracting officers, in conjunction with client departments, must be able to 
demonstrate that the risk associated with the procurement have been analyzed and 
that the limitation of liability provides adequate protection to the Crown or in 
the event that there is a substantive transfer of risk to the Crown, that 
appropriate approvals have been sought.  Decisions with respect to limiting a 
Contractor's liability should be made prior to the start of negotiations.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Notwithstanding any other clause in the Contract but subject to the 
       remaining provisions of this clause, the Contractor's total 
       cumulative liability to Canada for all losses or damage suffered by 
       Canada as a result of all breaches of the Contractor's obligations 
       under the Contract or the faulty carrying out of the Contract 
       (including any liability of Canada to a third party and including 
       any liability in tort, negligence or any other cause of action) 
       shall be limited to _______ <strong>(insert $ amount)</strong> **

       <strong>**Note</strong>:       <strong>It is preferable to add the following wording for 
                     multi year service contracts</strong>: "for losses or damage 
                     caused in any one year of carrying out of the Contract, 
                     each such year starting on the date of coming into 
                     force of the Contract or its anniversary".

       The foregoing limitation shall not apply: 

       (a)    to any breach of the repair or replacement or rework warranty 
              obligations of the Contract,

       (b)    to any breach of intellectual property rights that results in 
              Canada losing in whole or in part the enjoyment of anything 
              delivered under the Contract.

2.     For greater certainty, this clause shall not oblige Canada to 
       indemnify the Contractor against the Contractor's direct liability 
       to any third party, or limit the Contractor's liability to Canada 
       for any amount in respect of the Contractor's direct liability to a 
       third party that Canada is required to pay as a result of joint and 
       several liability.  Neither shall this clause require any 
       contribution by Canada in relation to any such direct third-party 
       liability of the Contractor.
