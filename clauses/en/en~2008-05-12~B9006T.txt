<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<p>Before contract award, the successful Bidder may be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Canada that the certified capacity of the docking facility, including any means or conveyance to remove the vessel from the water, is adequate for the anticipated loading in accordance with the related dry docking plans and other documents detailed in the Contract. The successful Bidder will be notified in writing and will be allowed a reasonable period of time to provide detailed keel block load distribution sketches and blocking stability considerations, along with the supporting calculations to show the adequacy of the proposed docking arrangement.</p>
<p>Before contract award and within <span class="input-required"><var>_____</var> <kbd>(<em>insert number of days</em>)</kbd></span> calendar days of written notification by the Contracting Authority, the successful Bidder must provide current and valid certification of the capacity and condition of the docking facility to be used for the Work. The certification must be provided by a recognized consultant or classification society and must have been issued within the past two years.</p>
<p>Although a dry docking facility may have a total capacity greater than the vessel to be docked, the weight distribution of the vessel may cause individual block loading to be exceeded. Also,
while the physical dimensions of a dry docking facility may indicate acceptability for docking of a specific vessel, other limitations such as spacing of rails on a marine railway, concrete piers of abutments adjoining the dry dock may, preclude the facility from being considered as a possible dry docking site and render the bid non-responsive.</p>
