<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Persons in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada, are bound by 
       economic sanctions imposed by Canada.  As a result, the Government 
       of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services that originate, 
       either directly or indirectly, from the countries or persons subject 
       to economic sanctions.

       Details on existing sanctions can be found at:
       <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/trade/sanctions-en.asp</strong>.

2.     It is a condition of this Contract that the Consultant not supply to 
       the Government of Canada any goods or services which are subject to 
       economic sanctions.

3.     By law, the Consultant must comply with changes to the regulations 
   imposed during the life of the Contract.  During the performance of the 
   Contract, should the imposition of sanctions against a country or person 
   or the addition of a good or service to the list of sanctioned goods or 
   services cause an impossibility of performance for the Consultant, the 
   situation will be treated by the Parties as a force majeure.  The 
   Consultant shall forthwith inform Canada of the situation; the 
   procedures applicable to force majeure shall then apply.
