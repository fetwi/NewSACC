<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>All liability insurance policies of the contractor must incorporate the 
conditions specified in this clause in order to protect the interests of Canada.

</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The following clauses must be incorporated into the liability insurance 
policy (or policies):

(A)    "<strong>Additional Named Insured</strong>:  Canada is named as an Additional Named 
       Insured under any liability insurance policies for Canada's 
       respective rights and interests under the Contract."

(B)    "<strong>Cross Liability</strong>:  Any act or omission by one or another of the 
       Insured hereunder shall not prejudice the rights or interests of any 
       other Insured.  This policy, subject to its limits of liability, 
       shall apply to each Insured in the same manner and to the same 
       extent as if a separate policy had been issued to each.  The 
       inclusion herein of more than one Insured shall not operate to 
       increase the limits of the Insurers' liability."

(C)    "<strong>Litigation Rights</strong>:  It is understood and agreed that where any suit 
       is instituted for or against Canada which the insurer, or insurers 
       would, but for this clause, have the right to pursue or defend on 
       behalf of Canada as an Additional Named Insured under this insurance 
       policy, the insurer shall promptly contact the Attorney General of 
       Canada to agree on the legal strategies by sending a registered 
       letter to:

       Senior General Counsel,
       Civil Litigation Section,
       Department of Justice Canada,
       Kent and Wellington Streets,
       Ottawa, Ontario
       K1A 0H8

       The notification must be followed, within a reasonable period, by an 
       information copy to the Contracting Authority.

       The insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right to co-defend 
       any action brought against Canada.  However, all expenses incurred 
       by Canada to co-defend such actions would be at Canada's expense."

(D)    "<strong>Notice of Cancellation</strong>:  The insurer agrees to give the Contracting 
       Authority at least fifteen (15) days' prior written notice of any 
       policy cancellation or any changes in the policy coverage."
