              and if no date is specified in the Contract for delivery of 
              those specifications to Canada, the Contractor shall deliver 
              those specifications to Canada forthwith following execution 
              of the Contract or, where delivery of the Hardware is to 
              occur more than 30 days after execution of the Contract, at 
              any time prior to the 30th day before the date specified in 
              the Contract for delivery of the Hardware.  Unless otherwise 
              agreed in writing between the Parties,  Canada shall complete 
              preparation of the site prior to the date specified for

       (3)    Canada shall give notice to the Contractor when the site is 
              prepared, after which the Contractor shall promptly inspect 
              the site and advise the Contracting Authority and the 
              Technical Authority of the results of the inspection.  
              Inspection by the Contractor shall not relieve Canada of 
              Canada's obligation to meet the requirements of the site 
              specifications.

       (4)    The Contractor shall be solely responsible for additional 
              expenses incurred by Canada resulting from necessary 
              alterations or modifications to a site prepared pursuant to 
              the specifications provided by the Contractor when the 
              alterations or modifications are attributable to incomplete 
              or erroneous specifications.

       (5)    If the site is not prepared by Canada in accordance with the 
              site preparation specifications within the time specified in 
              the Contract, and if the delay is for reasons other than an 
              act in Canada's sovereign capacity or the occurrence of an 
              event of force majeure or of any other event reasonably 
              beyond Canada's control, then the Contractor shall be 
              entitled to be paid its additional costs reasonably and 
              properly incurred as a direct result of the delay.  

       (6)    The Contractor warrants that, if the site is prepared and 
              maintained in conformity with the site preparation 
              specifications, the resultant environment will permit the 
              operation of the Hardware in conformity with the 
              Specifications.

<strong>9601-1 03     (01/12/92)    Transportation and Installation</strong>


       (1)    The Contractor shall arrange for all necessary transportation,

<strong>9601-1 06     (01/12/92)    Availability-level Test</strong>


       (1)    In this section: 

              "Downtime" means the time, to be measured in hours and whole 
              minutes, during which the Hardware is not available for use 
              during User Time due to a malfunction of the Hardware; 
              Downtime commences when Canada notifies the Contractor that 
              the Hardware is not available for use and ceases when the 
              malfunction has been corrected and the Contractor notifies 
              Canada that the Hardware is available for use;

              "Operational Use Time" means the time, to be measured in 
              hours and whole minutes, during which the Hardware performs 
              its function or activity in accordance with the 
              Specifications during User Time, and includes all intervals 
              between the stop and start times of the Hardware during User 
              Time that do not constitute Downtime;

              "User Time" means the time, to be measured in hours and whole 
              minutes, during which Canada intends to make use of the 
              Hardware; and unless otherwise indicated in the Contract, 
              User Time means the period from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., local 
              time at the Hardware installation site, Mondays through 
              Fridays inclusive, excluding statutory holidays observed by 
              Canada at such site.

       (2)    If the Contractor is to install the Hardware pursuant to the 
              Contract, the Contractor shall give notice to the Technical 
              Authority when the Hardware is Ready for Use.  The Technical 
              Authority shall commence the Availability-level Test within 
              10 days following receipt of the Ready-for-Use notice 
              referred to above or the Ready-for-Use date specified in the 
              Contract, whichever is later.

       (3)    Where installation of the Hardware is the responsibility of 
              Canada, and where Canada intends to subject the Hardware to 
              Availability-level Testing, Canada shall install the Hardware 
              within 10 days following its delivery to Canada or following 
              the delivery date specified in the Contract, whichever is 
              later, and shall immediately commence the Availability-level 
              Test.

       (4)    Without prejudice to Canada's other rights under the Contract, 
              Canada shall have access to the Hardware and may make 
              unrestricted operational use of it after the Contractor has 
              given notice that it is Ready for Use or, where installation 
              is the responsibility of Canada, after it is delivered to and 
              installed by Canada.  However, the Contractor shall, at all 
              times prior to acceptance of the Hardware, have priority with 
              respect to access to the Hardware to maintain the Hardware 
              and to fulfill the requirements of the Contract.

       (5)    The Hardware must achieve a minimum of 95 percent 
              availability level, or such other minimum percentage as may 
              be specified in the Contract, for 30 consecutive calendar 
              days.  All Operational Use Time shall be included in 
              determining the availability level.  Availability level shall 
              be calculated as follows:

                     Operational Use
                     Time
                     ________________   X 100%

                     Operational Use
                     Time + Downtime


       (6)    The Contractor shall ensure that the 30-day minimum 
              availability level mentioned in subsection (5) is achieved 
              within 90 consecutive calendar days of the first full day 
              after the Technical Authority commences the 
              Availability-level Test in accordance with subsection (2) or 
              (3).

       (7)    Subject to subsection (8), if Canada fails to carry out 
              Availability-level Testing during any period or periods of 
              time during which Canada is obligated under the Contract to 
              carry out such testing, then, for the purposes of calculating 
              the availability level of the Hardware during that time, that 
              time shall be deemed to constitute uninterrupted Operational 
              Use Time.

       (8)    If Canada is unable to commence or continue the 
              Availability-level Test because of an act in Canada's 
              sovereign capacity or the occurrence of an event of force 
              majeure, the Availability-level Test may be temporarily 
              suspended by Canada for a period of time not to exceed 60 
              days.  The time limits for testing referred to in this 
              section or elsewhere in the Contract shall in such cases be 
              extended by the number of calendar days of the suspension.

<strong>9601-1 07     (01/12/92)    Acceptance</strong>


       (1)    Canada shall give notice to the Contractor that the Hardware 
              is accepted when all of the following have occurred:

              (a)    the Contractor has completed the whole of the Work in 
                     accordance with the terms of the Contract, except for 
                     warranty work and any other work which is scheduled 
                     under the Contract to be performed after the start of 
                     the warranty period defined in subsection 8(1) 
                     (Warranty);

              (b)    the Hardware has passed all acceptance tests set out 
                     or referred to in the Contract; and 
 
              (c)    where an Availability-level Test is conducted, the 
                     Hardware has achieved the minimum availability level 
                     in accordance with the provisions of the 
                     Availability-level Test.

       (2)    Until such time as Canada gives the notice referred to in 
              subsection (1), Canada reserves the right to reject the whole 
              of the Hardware, including any part or parts of the Hardware 
              previously inspected and accepted by or on behalf of Canada.

<strong>9601-1 08     (01/12/92)    Warranty</strong>


       (1)    In this section, unless otherwise indicated in the Contract, 
              "Warranty Period" means a period of 12 months from:

              (a)    where an Availability-level Test is conducted, the 
                     first day of the 30-day period in which the Hardware 
                     has achieved the minimum availability level in

              (b)    where Canada does not conduct an Availability-level 
                     Test, the date on which the Contractor has completed 
                     the whole of the Work in accordance with the terms of 
                     the Contract, except for warranty work and any other 
                     work which is scheduled under the Contract to be 
                     performed after the start of the Warranty Period.

       (2)    Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance of the Work by or 
              on behalf of Canada and without restricting any other 
              provision of the Contract or any condition, warranty or 
              provision implied or imposed by law, the Contractor warrants 
              that, during the Warranty Period, the Hardware shall:

              (a)    be free from all defects in materials or workmanship;

              request of Canada to do so, shall, as soon as possible, 
              repair, replace or otherwise make good at its own option and 
              expense the part of the Hardware found to be defective or not 
              in conformance with the requirements of the Contract.

       (4)    The Hardware or any part thereof found to be defective or 
              non-conforming may be returned to the Contractor's repair 
              facility for replacement, repair or making good; provided 
              that, when in the opinion of Canada it is not expedient to 
              remove the Hardware from its location, the Contractor shall 
              carry out any necessary repair or making good at that 
              location, and shall, except as otherwise provided in the 
              Contract, be paid the fair and reasonable Cost (including 
              reasonable travelling and living expenses) incurred in so 
              doing, with no allowance therein by way of profit, less an 
              amount equal to the Cost of rectifying the defect or 
              nonconformance at the Contractor's repair facility.

       (5)    Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, Canada shall 
              pay the transportation cost associated with returning any 
              Hardware or part thereof to the Contractor's repair facility 
              pursuant to subsection (4), and the Contractor shall pay the 
              transportation cost associated with forwarding the 
              replacement or returning the Hardware or part thereof, when 
              rectified, to the delivery point specified in the Contract, 
              or such lesser cost as may be required to transport the

              termination notice given by the Minister under or pursuant to 
              the provisions of this section, except to the extent that

              the possession of Canada, except when the loss or damage is 
              caused by the negligence of Canada or by anyone acting on 
              behalf of Canada.

       (2)    If the Hardware is lost or damaged, and if such loss or

       (3)    If the Hardware is lost or damaged, and if such loss or 
              damage is not caused by the Contractor or by Canada or by 
              anyone acting on behalf of either of them, the Contractor 
              shall, as soon as possible, repair or replace the Hardware at 
              its option and expense.  In such event, the lease period, and 
              Canada's liability to pay lease payments, shall not be 
              affected.

       connection with return of the Hardware to the Contractor's premises.  
       Unless otherwise indicated in the Contract, all costs associated 
       with such deinstallation, removal and return are included in the 
       Contract Price.

              not in default in carrying out any of Canada's obligations 
              under the Contract, Canada shall have unlimited use of the 
              Hardware without disturbance by the Contractor, except when 
              the Contractor is performing maintenance pursuant to the 
              provisions of the Contract, and without disturbance by any 
              other person lawfully claiming by, through or under the 
              Contractor.

<strong>9601-1 19     (01/12/92)    Right to Withhold Lease Payments</strong>


       (1)    If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its 
              obligations under the Contract, Canada may, without prejudice 
              to any other right which Canada may have, including the right 
              to terminate the Contract for default, withhold the Hardware 
              lease payments from the Contractor until the default is cured.

       (2)    Canada may exercise the right set out in subsection (1) by 
              giving notice that describes the event of default to the 
              Contractor from the Contracting Authority.  Any amounts 
              withheld pursuant to that notice may be set off by Canada 
              against any amounts owed by the Contractor to Canada as 
              damages as a result of the default.
