Work that the following specific business opportunities for the provision of 
goods and services associated with the Work shall be provided through the 
Contractor or Subcontractors as set out in the subclause hereunder. The 
Contractor will provide the companies, listed below, a length of time to prepare

solicited. In any event, not less than fifteen (15) calendar days shall be 
provided for a bid response from the date the solicitation documents are

accordingly (if required).
