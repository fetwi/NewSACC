<h2>GC5.2 (2010-01-11) Amount Payable</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Subject to any other provisions of the Contract,
Canada shall pay the Contractor, at the times and in the manner
hereinafter set out, the amount by which the amounts payable by
Canada to the Contractor in accordance with the Contract exceed the
amounts payable by the Contractor to Canada, and the Contractor
shall accept that amount as payment in full satisfaction for
everything furnished and done by the Contractor in respect of the
Work to which the payment relates.</li>
<li value="2">When making any payment to the Contractor, the
failure of Canada to deduct an amount payable to Canada by the
Contractor shall not constitute a waiver of the right to do so, or
an admission of lack of entitlement to do so in any subsequent
payment to the Contractor.</li>
<li value="3">Should any payment be made by Canada in excess of
what is owed to the Contractor for the actual work performed, the
Contractor will reimburse Canada the excess immediately, with or
without demand, and any amounts outstanding shall bear simple
interest at the Average Bank rate plus 3 percent per annum from the
date of overpayment until the day prior to the date of repayment by
the Contractor.</li>
<li value="4">No payment other than a payment that is expressly
stipulated in the Contract, shall be made by Canada to the

</ol>
<h2>GC5.3 (2008-05-12) Increased or Decreased Costs</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contract Amount shall not be increased nor
decreased by reason of any increase or decrease in the cost of the
Work that is brought about by an increase or decrease in the cost
of labour, Plant, Material or any wage adjustment arising pursuant
to the Labour Conditions.</li>
<li value="2">Notwithstanding paragraph 1) of GC5.3, if any change,
including a new imposition or repeal, of any tax, customs or other
duty, charge, or any similar imposition that is imposed under
sales, customs or excise tax legislation of the Government of
Canada or any Provincial or Territorial legislation, affects the
cost of the Work to the Contractor, and occurs
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">after the date of submission by the Contractor of its
bid; or</li>
<li value="2">after the date of submission of the last revision, if
the Contractor's bid was revised;</li>
<li value="3">the Contract Amount shall be adjusted in the manner
provided in paragraph 3) of GC5.3.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">If a change referred to in paragraph 2) of GC5.3
occurs, the Contract Amount shall be increased or decreased by an
amount established by an examination by Canada of the relevant
records of the Contractor referred to in GC2.8, "Accounts and
Audits", to be the increase or decrease in the cost incurred by the
Contractor that is directly attributable to that change.</li>
<li value="4">For the purpose of paragraph 2) of GC5.3, if a tax is
changed after the tender closing, but public notice of the change
has been given by the Minister of Finance or the corresponding
Provincial or Territorial authority before that closing, the change
shall be deemed to have occurred before the solicitation
closing.</li>
<li value="5">Notwithstanding paragraphs 2) to 4) of GC5.3, no
adjustment to the Contract Amount in respect of the Work or a part
thereof shall be made for a change in any imposition referred to in
this section that occurs after the date required by the Contract
for completion of the Work or that part of the Work.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC5.4 (2010-01-11) Progress Payment</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">On the expiration of a payment period, the Contractor
shall deliver to Canada
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">a written progress claim in a form acceptable to
Canada that fully describes any part of the Work that has been
completed, and any Material that was delivered to the Work site but
not incorporated into the Work, during that payment period,
and</li>
<li value="2">a completed and signed statutory declaration
containing a declaration that, up to the date of the progress
claim, the Contractor has complied with all lawful obligations with
respect to the Labour Conditions and that, in respect of the Work,
all lawful obligations of the Contractor to its Subcontractors and
Suppliers, referred to collectively in the declaration as "
subcontractors and suppliers", have been fully discharged.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Within 10 days of receipt of a progress claim and
statutory declaration from the Contractor, Canada shall inspect, or
cause to have inspected, the part of the Work and the Material

and the Material described in the progress claim that, in the
opinion of Canada
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">is in accordance with the Contract; and</li>
<li value="2">was not included in any other progress report
relating to the Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Subject to GC5.2, "Amount Payable", and paragraph 5)
of GC5.4, Canada shall pay the Contractor an amount that is equal

progress report if a labour and material payment bond has been
furnished by the Contractor; or</li>
<li value="2">90 percent of the value that is indicated in Canada's

progress schedule or updated progress schedule, in accordance with
GC3.1, "Progress Schedule",</li>
</ol>
<p>whichever is later.</p>
</li>
<li value="5">In the case of the Contractor's first progress claim,
it is a condition precedent to Canada's obligation under paragraph
3) of GC5.4 that the Contractor has provided all necessary
documentation required by the Contract for the first progress
claim.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GC5.5 (2008-05-12) Substantial Performance of the Work</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If, at any time before the issuance of a Certificate
of Completion, Canada determines that the Work has reached
Substantial Performance as described in subparagraph 1) (b) of
GC1.1.4, "Substantial Performance", Canada shall issue a
Certificate of Substantial Performance to the Contractor. The
Certificate of Substantial Performance shall state or describe
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the date of Substantial Performance;</li>
<li value="2">the parts of the Work not completed to the
satisfaction of Canada; and</li>
<li value="3">all things that must be done by the Contractor before

warranty period referred to in GC3.13, "Warranty and Rectification
of Defects in Work", commences for the said parts and all the said
things.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The issuance of a Certificate of Substantial
Performance does not relieve the Contractor from the Contractor's
obligations under GC3.11, "Defective Work".</li>
<li value="3">Subject to GC5.2, "Amount Payable", and paragraph 4)
of GC5.5, Canada shall pay the Contractor the amount referred to in

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the sum of all payments that were made pursuant to
GC5.4, "Progress Payment";</li>
<li value="2">an amount that is equal to Canada's estimate of the
cost to Canada of rectifying defects described in the Certificate
of Substantial Performance; and</li>
<li value="3">an amount that is equal to Canada's estimate of the
cost to Canada of completing the parts of the Work described in the
Certificate of Substantial Performance other than defects listed
therein.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">Canada shall pay the amount referred to in paragraph
3) of GC5.5 not later than

pursuant thereto, and that the Work has been completed as described
in GC1.1.5, "Completion", Canada shall issue a Certificate of
Completion to the Contractor and, if the Work or a portion of the
Work is subject to a Unit Price Arrangement, Canada shall issue a

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Neither acceptance of a progress claim or progress
report, nor any payment made by Canada under the Contract, nor

Contract.</li>

<p>GC5.8 (2008-05-12) Claims and Obligations</p>
<ol type="1">

such legislation, setting out the steps by way of notice,

no claim shall be deemed to have expired, become void or
unenforceable by reason of the claimant not commencing any action
within the time prescribed by such legislation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="6">The Contractor shall, at the request of any claimant,
submit to binding arbitration those questions that need to be

rented equipment should such Subcontractor or Supplier wish to be
adjoined, and Canada shall not be a party to such arbitration.
Subject to any agreement between the Contractor and the claimant,
the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the governing
Provincial or Territorial legislation applicable to the site of the
