<h2>2029 02 (2008-05-12) Standard Clauses and Conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public Works and Government
Services Act</cite>, S.C. 1996, c.16, the clauses and conditions
identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2>2029 03 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is as an independent Contractor engaged by Canada
to perform the Work. Neither the Contractor nor any of its
personnel is engaged as an employee, servant or agent of Canada.
The Contractor is responsible for all deductions and remittances
required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2>2029 04 (2008-05-12) Condition of Material</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, material supplied
must be new and conform to the latest issue of the applicable
drawing, specification and part number that is in effect on the bid
solicitation closing date or, if there was no bid solicitation, the
date of the Contract.</p>
<h2>2029 05 (2010-01-11) Inspection, Acceptance and Warranty</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must perform the Work efficiently in
accordance with standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in
full conformity with all the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance
by Canada. Despite inspection and acceptance of the Work by or on
behalf of Canada and without restricting any provisions of the
Contract or any condition, warranty or provision imposed by law,
the Contractor, if requested by Canada to do so, must replace,
repair or correct, at its own option and expense any work that
becomes defective or fails to conform to the requirements of the
Contract, where applicable. For goods, the warranty period will be
twelve (12) months after delivery and acceptance of the Work or the
length of the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty
period, whichever is longer.</li>
<li value="3">Canada must pay the transportation cost associated
with returning the Work or any part of the Work to the Contractor's
plant for replacement, repair or making good, and the Contractor
must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the
replacement or returning the Work or part of the Work when
rectified to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to
another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of
Canada, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location,
the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good
of the Work at that location and will be reimbursed its reasonable
travel and living expenses.</li>
<li value="4">The warranty period is automatically extended by the
duration of any period or periods where the Work is unavailable for
use or cannot be used because of a defect or non-conformance during
the original warranty period. The warranty applies to any part of
the Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to subsection 2,
for the greater of:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the warranty period remaining, including the
extension, or</li>
<li value="2">ninety (90) days or such other period as may be
specified for that purpose by agreement between the Parties.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2029 06 (2008-05-12) Invoice Submission</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name.
The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment;
invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must
indicate whether it covers partial of final delivery.</li>
<li value="2">Invoices must show:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the date, the name and address of the client
department, item or reference numbers, deliverable and/or
description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number
(CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial
code(s);</li>
<li value="2">details of expenditures in accordance with the Basis
of Payment, exclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized
Sales Tax (HST) (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price,
fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as
applicable);</li>
<li value="3">deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li value="5">if applicable, the method of shipment together with
date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">If applicable, the GST or HST must be specified on
all invoices as a separate item. All items that are zero-rated,
exempt or to which the GST or HST does not apply, must be
identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li value="4">By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2029 07 (2010-08-16) Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Municipal Taxes
<p>Municipal Taxes are not applicable.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Provincial Taxes
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Excluding legislated exceptions, federal government
departments and agencies are not required to pay any sales tax
payable to the province in which the taxable goods or services are
delivered. This exemption has been provided to federal government
departments and agencies under the authority of one of the
following:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Exemption License Numbers,
for the provinces of:
<p>Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250</p>
<p>Manitoba 390-516-0</p>
</li>
<li value="2">for Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, the
Northwest Territories and Nunavut, an Exemption Certificate, which
certifies that the goods or services purchased are not subject to
the provincial/territorial sales and consumption taxes because they
are purchased by the federal government with Canada funds for the
use of the federal government.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Currently, in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, the
Northwest Territories and Nunavut, there is no general PST.
However, if a PST is introduced in Alberta, the Yukon Territory,
the Northwest Territories or Nunavut, the sales tax exemption
certificate would be required on the purchasing document.</li>
<li value="3">Federal departments must pay the HST in the
participating provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Ontario and British Columbia.</li>
<li value="4">The Contractor is not exempt from paying PST under
the above Exemption License Numbers or Exemption Certificate. The
Contractor must pay the PST on taxable goods or services used or
consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with
applicable provincial legislation), including material incorporated
into real property.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Changes to Taxes and Duties
<p>If there is any change to any tax or duty payable to any level
of government in Canada after the bid submission date that affects
the costs of the Work to the Contractor, the Contract Price will be
adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the cost to the
Contractor. However, there will be no adjustment for any change
that increases the cost of the Work to the Contractor if public
notice of the change was given before bid submission date in
sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the
effect of the change on its cost. There will be no adjustment if
the change takes effect after the date required by the Contract for
delivery of the Work.</p>
</li>
<li value="4">GST or HST
<p>The estimated GST or HST, if applicable, is included in the
total estimated cost of the Contract. The GST or HST is not
included in the Contract price but will be paid by Canada as
provided in the Invoice Submission section above. The Contractor
agrees to remit to Canada Revenue Agency any amounts of GST and HST
paid or due.</p>
</li>
<li value="5">Tax Withholding of 15 Percent
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, 1985, c. 1 (5th
Supp.) and the <cite>Income Tax Regulations</cite>, Canada must
withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in
respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is a
non-resident unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver. The
amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in
respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2029 08 (2010-01-11) Transportation Costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2>2029 09 (2010-01-11) Transportation Carriers' Liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the FOB point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2>2029 10 (2008-05-12) Shipment Documentation</h2>
<p>For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading
must accompany the original invoice, except for "collect" shipments
(if and when stipulated), in which event it must accompany the
shipment. In addition, a packing slip must accompany each shipment,
showing item, quantity, part or reference numbers, description of
the goods and contract number, including the CRN and PBN. If the
goods have been inspected at the Contractor's plant, the signed
inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally
enclosed in the packing note envelope.</p>
<h2>2029 11 (2008-05-12) Payment Period</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada's standard payment period is thirty (30) days.
The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31st day following that date and interest
will be paid automatically in accordance with section 12.</li>
<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within fifteen (15) days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
fifteen (15) days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2029 12 (2008-12-12) Interest on Overdue Accounts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">For the purposes of this section:
<p><dfn>"Average Rate"</dfn> means the simple arithmetic mean of the
Bank Rates in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time each day during the
calendar month which immediately before the calendar month in which
payment is made;</p>
<p><dfn>"Bank Rate"</dfn> means the rate of interest established from
time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the

Payments Association;</p>
<p><dfn>"date of payment"</dfn> means the date of the negotiable
instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada to pay any
amount under the Contract;</p>
<p>an amount becomes <dfn>"overdue"</dfn> when it is unpaid on the first day
following the day on which it is due and payable according to the
Contract.</p>
</li>
<li value="2">Canada will pay the Contractor simple interest at the
Average Rate plus 3 percent per year on any amount that is overdue,
from the date that amount becomes overdue until the day before the
date of payment, inclusive. The Contractor is not required to
provide notice to Canada for interest to be payable.</li>
<li value="3">Canada will pay interest in accordance with this
section only if Canada is responsible for the delay in paying the
Contractor. Canada will not pay interest on overdue advance
payments.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2029 13 (2008-05-12) Audit</h2>
<p>The amount claimed under the Contract is subject to government
audit both before and after payment is made. The Contractor must
keep proper accounts and records of the cost of performing the Work

after it receives the final payment under the Contract.</p>
<h2>2029 14 (2008-05-12) Compliance with Applicable Laws</h2>

Contract.</p>
<h2>2029 17 (2008-05-12) Government Property</h2>

will be entitled to be reimbursed the actual costs reasonably and
properly incurred as a direct result of the termination, but in no
case such reimbursement must exceed the Contract price. The
Contractor will have no claim for damages, compensation, loss of
profit or otherwise, except as provided in this section.</p>
<h2>2029 21 (2008-05-12) Right of Set-off</h2>
<p>Without restricting any right of set-off given by law, Canada
may set-off against any amount payable to the Contractor under the
Contract, any amount payable to Canada by the Contractor under the

<h2>2029 22 (2008-05-12) Conflict of Interest and Values and Ethics
