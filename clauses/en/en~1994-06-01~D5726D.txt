<pre>Use the following clause to outline Bidder/Contractor responsibility to inspect 
and provide an inspection/test report of actual measurements taken when 
procurement is for Non-Safety Critical Class 3 Threaded Fasteners.  NSN Classes 
5305, 5306, 5307, 5310 and 5315.

</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>If Class 3 Threaded Fasteners are being provided as a requirement of the 
Contract, then the Contractor shall provide to the Quality Assurance 
Representative (QAR) a valid inspection/test report of the results obtained 
for the following parameters:


       a.     "go" functional diameter size;

       b.     pitch diameter size;

       c.     major diameter size (external threads only);

       d.     minor diameter size (does not apply to MIL-S-7742 external 
              threads); and

       e.     root radius (applies to MIL-S-8879 external threads only);

Unless otherwise specified, the above excludes self-locking nuts, internal 
threads smaller than 0.190 inch diameter, and external threads smaller than 
0.138 inch diameter.

Products manufactured prior to March 1993 where Pitch diameter or 
Functional Diameter cannot be accomplished due to configuration change (e.g. 
deformation, slots, self-locking devices), acceptance shall be based on 
performance requirements only.  For products manufactured after March 1993, 
the screw threads shall be measured at the point of manufacture prior to 
configuration change.

Definitions of these terms can be found in the latest revision of 
MIL-S-7742 or MIL-S-8879.

Copies of the original manufacturing inspection data with batch/lot 
traceability covering the above parameters, a. through e., may be utilized 
or, if not available, then the Contractor shall use the sampling table 
shown below and shall test/record the results for the thread elements 
listed.

If the inspection/test report is not available from the manufacturer, the 
Contractor shall have the inspection performed, at the Contractor's expense, 
either at his own facility or at a facility acceptable to the QAR.

The Bidder/Contractor hereby certifies that the stated unit price for each 
of the items identified above includes the Test Reports called up under 
this clause.
