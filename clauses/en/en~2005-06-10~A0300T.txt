government specifications, which are available without proprietary 
limitations (such as Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), National 
Aerospace Standard (NAS), Army-Navy Aeronautical Standard (AN), and 
Military Standard (MS) hardware items).  Commercial parts consist of common 
non-aeronautical parts produced to recognized industry specifications and 
available on the commercial market.  Deliverable standard and commercial 
parts shall be in a new condition.

              or,

       (b)    the authorized manufacturer or agent/distributor of the owner 
              of the design or manufacturing rights to the items; or

<strong>3.     Category #3 - Other Condition</strong>

       Any deliverable end item condition other than Category # 1 or 
       Category #2.  Should the Bidder be offering deliverable end items in 
       Category #3, a complete description of the item's condition and all 
       available traceability documentation is required.  Bids containing 
       parts identified in this Category are subject to acceptance by the
