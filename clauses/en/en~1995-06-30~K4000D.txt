<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><strong>Canadian Goods:</strong>  Goods wholly manufactured or originating in Canada are 
considered Canadian goods.  Products containing imported components may 
also be considered Canadian for the purpose of this policy when they have 
undergone sufficient change in Canada, in a manner that satisfies the 
definition specified under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Rules of Origin.  
For photocopiers, computers and office equipment within Federal Supply 
Classification (FSC) groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products of MERIT/
CIRCLE firms or companies in Priority Group 1 prior to April 1992 are 
considered Canadian (see below the paragraph on MERIT Partnership Program 
and CIRCLE Program).

<strong>Canadian Services</strong>: Proposals consisting solely of services with a minimum 
of 80 percent of the total bid price provided by Canadian-based personnel 
are considered Canadian services.  

<strong>Variety of Goods</strong>:   When requirements consist of more than one good:

a)     <strong>Aggregate Evaluation</strong>:  no less than 80 percent of the total bid 
       price must consist of Canadian goods; or, 

b)     <strong>Item by Item Evaluation</strong>:  In some cases, the bid evaluation may be 
       conducted on an item-by-item basis and contracts may be awarded to 
       more than one supplier.  In these cases, suppliers will be asked to 
       identify separately, each item that meets the definition of Canadian 
       goods.

<strong>Mix of Goods and Services:</strong>  Except for science and technology requirements 
(see paragraph a) below), when requirements consist of a mix of goods and 
services, no less than 80 percent of the total bid price must consist of 
Canadian goods and services.

<strong>Other Canadian Goods and Services:</strong> 

a)     <strong>Science and Technology Contracting-Out Policy:</strong>  Treasury Board's 
       Science and Technology Contracting-Out Policy sets out the basis for 
       competing the science and technology requirements of the federal 
       government.  Science and technology requirements may be sourced 
       exclusively from Canadian suppliers.  The percentage of the total 
       bid price that must consist of Canadian goods and/or services will 
       be 80 percent, unless otherwise stated in the Notice of Proposed 
       Procurement (NPP) and solicitation document.

b)     <strong>MERIT Partnership Program and CIRCLE Program:</strong>  For photocopiers, 
       computers and office equipment within FSC groups 36, 70 and 74, only 
       the products of the following firms are considered Canadian goods: 

       i)     MERIT Partners under the MERIT Partnership Program (sponsored 
              by Industry Canada (IC));

       ii)    Companies which, on March 31, 1992, were allocated to 
              Priority Group 1 under the Priority Groups Policy in effect 
              at that time; or

       iii)   CIRCLE companies as agreed on by IC and Science, Informatics 
              and Professional Services Sector.

       Further information regarding the MERIT and CIRCLE programs may be 
       obtained from Industry Canada, Information Technologies Industry 
       Branch, Ottawa, Ontario, (613) 952-8420.

 c)    <strong>Motor Vehicles</strong>:  Motor vehicles are considered to be Canadian goods 
       for the purpose of the Canadian Content policy if they qualify for 
       purchase under the provisions identifying vehicles normally 
       purchased in Canada as set out in <em>Treasury Board  Manual, 
       Information and Administrative Management, Materiel, Risk and Common 
       Services</em>, Part I, Chapter 2. 

d)     <strong>Textiles:</strong>  Textiles are considered to be Canadian goods according to 
       a modified rule of origin, copies of which are available from the 
       Textile Division, Industrial and Commercial Products Sector.
