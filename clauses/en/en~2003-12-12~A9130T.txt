are hereby advised that only persons who are registered, exempt or excluded 
under the Controlled Goods Program (CGP) are lawfully entitled to examine, 
possess or transfer controlled goods.

If the bid solicitation document includes controlled goods information or 
technology, the bidder must be registered under the CGP or exempt from it 
prior to receiving the bid solicitation document.  Requests for Technical 
Data Packages or specifications related to the controlled goods should be 
made in writing to the Contracting Authority identified herein.

If the bid solicitation document does not include controlled goods 
information or technology but the resultant contract requires the

must be registered under the CGP prior to contract award.
