<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Contractor warrants that it is not under common ownership control of 
another division, parent company or affiliate supplying materials and/or 
services in connection with the performance of the Work under the Contract. 
For the purposes of this warranty, the phrase "ownership control" means 
that at least 50 percent of the voting rights are held by the related 
entity.  The Contractor acknowledges that the Minister has relied on the 
warranty in establishing the price payable under the Contract and that, in 
the event of breach of such warranty, the Minister shall have the right to 
treat this Contract as being in default or, alternatively, the right to 
readjust the price to reflect the level of profit payable under 
departmental policy when common ownership control exists, as set out in the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS) Transfer Pricing 
Policy, copy of which the Contractor acknowledges to have received and 
which has been published in Chapter 10 of the DPWGS <em>Supply Manual</em>.
