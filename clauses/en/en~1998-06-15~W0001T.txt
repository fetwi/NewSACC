<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>This clause is to be used in solicitations involving final delivery to locations 
outside Comprehensive Land Claims Settlement Areas (CLCSAs) when the original 
requirement has been divided to handle final delivery locations outside CLCSAs 
on one solicitation and final delivery locations inside CLCSAs on a different 
solicitation. Contracting Officers are to modify the clauses as required for 
either a standing offer or contract and to insert the solicitation number 
dealing with deliveries inside CLCSAs.

The second paragraph of this clause is to cover the eventuality of there being 
no bids received as a result of the solicitation pertaining to delivery 
locations inside a CLCSA. The clause gives Canada the capability to include 
final delivery locations inside CLCSAs in the proposed standing offer/contract 
with the successful bidder of the solicitation for delivery points outside 
CLCSAs.
