<strong>1.     Submission of Bids</strong>

(1)    It is the Bidder's responsibility to:

       (a)    return a signed original of the bid solicitation, duly 
              completed, IN THE FORMAT REQUESTED;

       (b)    direct its bid ONLY to the Bid Receiving address specified;

       (c)    ensure that the Bidder's name, the bid solicitation reference 
              number, and bid solicitation closing date and time are 
              clearly visible;

       (d)    provide a comprehensive and sufficiently detailed bid, 
              including all requested pricing details, that will permit a 
              complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out 
              in the bid solicitation.

              <strong>Timely and correct delivery of bids to the specified bid 
              delivery address is the sole responsibility of the Bidder.  
              Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) will not 
              assume or have transferred to it those responsibilities.  All 
              risks and consequences of incorrect delivery of bids are the 
              responsibility of the Bidder.</strong>

(2)    Bids may be accepted in whole or in part.  The lowest or any bid 
       will not necessarily be accepted. In the case of error in the 
       extension of prices, the unit price will govern.  Canada may enter 
       into contract without negotiation.

(3)    Bids will remain open for acceptance for a period of not less than 
       sixty (60) days from the closing date of the bid solicitation, 
       unless otherwise indicated by Canada in such bid solicitation.

       Notwithstanding the bid validity period stipulated in this 
       solicitation, Canada reserves the right to seek an extension from 
       all responsive bidders, within a minimum of three (3) days prior to 
       the end of such period.  Bidders shall have the option to either 
       accept or reject the extension.

       If the extension referred to above is accepted, in writing, by all 
       those who submitted responsive bids, then Canada shall continue 
       immediately with the evaluation of the bids and its approval 
       processes.

       If the extension referred to above is not accepted, in writing, by 
       all those who submitted responsive bids then Canada shall, at its 
       sole discretion, either: (a) continue to evaluate the responsive 
       bids of those who have accepted the extension and seek the necessary 
       approvals; or (b) cancel the solicitation; or (c) cancel and reissue 
       the solicitation.

(4)    While Canada may enter into contract without negotiation, Canada 
       reserves the right to negotiate with bidders on any procurement.

(5)    Bid documents and supporting information may be submitted in either 
       English or French.

(6)    Bids received on or before the stipulated bid solicitation closing 
       date and time will become the property of Canada and will not be 
       returned.  All bids will be treated as CONFIDENTIAL, subject to the 
       provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em>.

<strong>2.     Late Bids</strong>

       It is PWGSC's policy to return, unopened, bids delivered after the 
       stipulated bid solicitation closing date and time, unless they 
       qualify as a delayed bid as described below. 
<strong>3.     Delayed Bids</strong>

(1)    A bid delivered to the specified Bid Receiving area after the 
       closing date and time but before the contract award date may be 
       considered, provided the delay can be proven to have been due solely 
       to a delay in delivery that can be attributed to the Canada Post 
       Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a foreign country).  
       The only pieces of evidence relating to a delay in the CPC system 
       that are acceptable to PWGSC are:

       (a)    a CPC cancellation date stamp;
       (b)    a CPC Priority Courier Bill of Lading; and
       (c)    a CPC Xpresspost Label,

       that clearly indicate that the bid was mailed prior to the bid 
       closing date.

       Example:      If the bid closing date was May 15, 1995, then the CPC 
                     cancellation date stamp should read no later than May 
                     14, 1995, to be accepted.

(2)    Please request the postal employee to date-stamp your envelope.

(3)    For bids transmitted by facsimile, only the date and the time of 
       receipt recorded by PWGSC at the Bid Receiving number stated in the 
       bid solicitation will be accepted as evidence of a delayed bid.

(4)    Misrouting, traffic volume, weather disturbances, or any other 
       causes for the late delivery of bids are not acceptable reasons for 
       the bid to be accepted by PWGSC.

<strong>4.     Postage Meters</strong>

       Postage meter imprints, whether imprinted by the Supplier, the CPC 
       or the postal authority outside Canada, are not acceptable as proof 
       of timely mailing.  It should be noted that CPC does not normally 
       apply a cancellation date stamp to metered mail; this is usually 
       done only when postage stamps are used.

<strong>5.     Responses Transmitted by Facsimile</strong>

(1)    If you are in doubt that your bid will be delivered on time at the 
       specific location designated for the receipt of the bid, you may use 
       a facsimile, unless otherwise instructed in the bid solicitation.

       <strong>NOTE</strong>:  Due to the volume of technical material required for some 
              bids, certain bid solicitations may specify that submissions 
              by facsimile are not acceptable (e.g. science solicitations).

(2)    Unless otherwise instructed in the bid solicitation, the only 
       acceptable facsimile number for responses to bid solicitations 
       issued by PWGSC headquarters sectors is (819) 997-9776.

(3)    The facsimile number for responses to bid solicitations issued by 
       PWGSC regional offices is identified on the front page of the bid 
       solicitation.

       If the bidder chooses to submit a bid by facsimile, Canada will not 
       be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or 
       receipt of the faxed bid including, but not limited to the following:

       (a)    receipt of garbled or incomplete bid;
       (b)    availability or condition of the receiving facsimile 
equipment;
       (c)    incompatibility between the sending and receiving equipment;
       (d)    delay in transmission or receipt of the bid;
       (e)    failure of the Bidder to properly identify the bid;
       (f)    illegibility of the bid; or 
       (g)    security of bid data.

(4)    Bids submitted by facsimile will constitute your formal bid and must 
       contain:

       (a)    the bid reference number;
       (b)    the closing date and time;
       (c)    sufficient data to allow evaluation, such as unit prices, 
              country of currency in the event that the bid is submitted in 
              a foreign currency, sales tax, duty, technical data (where 
              applicable) and any deviation(s) from the bid solicitation 
              document.

(5)    For responses transmitted by facsimile, written confirmation is 
       required within two (2) working days after bid closing, unless 
       otherwise specified in this solicitation.  All documents confirming 
       bids should bear the word "CONFIRMATION".

<strong>6.     Customs Clearance</strong>

       It is the responsibility of the Bidder to allow sufficient time to 
       obtain customs clearance, where required, before the scheduled bid 
       closing date and time.  Delays related to the obtaining of customs 
       clearance cannot be construed as "undue delay in the mail" and will 
       not be accepted under the Late Bids Policy.

<strong>7.     Further Information</strong>

(1)    For further information, please contact the Contracting Authority 
       identified on page one of the bid solicitation.

(2)    For bid solicitations issued out of PWGSC headquarters, enquiries 
       concerning receipt of bids may be addressed to the Bid Receiving 
       Unit, Procurement Operational Support Division, telephone (819) 
       956-3370.

<strong>8.     Identity or Legal Capacity of Bidder</strong>

       In order to establish the legal capacity under which a bidder 
       proposes to enter into the Contract, any bidder who carries on 
       business in other than its own personal name shall, if requested by 
       the Contracting Authority, provide proof of the legal capacity under 
       which it carries on business to the Contracting Authority prior to 
       contract award.  Such proof may be in the form of a copy of the 
       articles of incorporation or of the registration of the business 
       name of a sole proprietor, of a trade name, of a partnership, etc.


<strong>B.     CONDITIONS (APPLICABLE TO RESULTING CONTRACT)</strong>

<strong>1.     Municipal Taxes</strong>

       Municipal taxes are not applicable.

<strong>2.     Provincial Taxes</strong>

(1)    Excluding legislated exceptions (see subsection (5) below), federal 
       government departments and agencies are not required to pay any ad 
       valorem sales tax levied by the province in which the taxable goods 
       or services are delivered.  This exemption has been provided to 
       federal government departments and agencies under the authority of 
       one of the following:

       (a)    Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Exemption Licence Numbers, for the 
              provinces of: 

              Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250
              Ontario                     11708174G
              Manitoba             390-516-0
              British Columbia     R005521

       (b)    An Exemption Certification, for Quebec, Saskatchewan, the 
              Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, which 
              certifies that the property and/or services ordered/purchased 
              hereby are for the use of, and are being purchased by the 
              federal government with Canada funds, and are therefore not 
              subject to provincial/territorial sales and consumption taxes.

(2)    Currently, in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest 
       Territories and Nunavut, there is no general PST.  However, should a 
       PST be introduced in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, or Yukon 
       Territory, the sales tax exemption certificate would be required on 
       purchase orders or other purchasing documents.

(3)    Federal departments are required to pay the Harmonized Sales Tax 
       (HST) in the participating provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
       Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

(4)    The Contractor is not exempt from paying PST under the above 
       Exemption Licence Numbers or Exemption Certification.  The 
       Contractor is required to pay the PST on taxable goods or services 
       used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (as per 
       appropriate provincial legislation), including material incorporated 
       into real property.
 
(5)    Exceptions

       The following exceptions are provided as examples and may not 
       represent a complete list of all exceptions under the law:

       (a)    tobacco products subject to tobacco taxes (except in Alberta);
       (b)    petroleum products subject to gasoline and motive fuel taxes;
       (c)    vehicle registration fees (except in Alberta, Northwest 
              Territories, Nunavut and Yukon Territory);
       (d)    amusement/admission (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick);
       (e)    insurance premiums (Quebec);
       (f)    tires/batteries subject to environmental levies; and
       (g)    transient living accommodation subject to hotel room taxes 
              (British Columbia).

<strong>3.     Condition of Material</strong>

       Unless otherwise specified elsewhere in the Contract, materiel 
       supplied shall be new and conform to the latest issue of the 
       applicable drawing, specification and/or part number that is in 
       effect on the solicitation closing date.

<strong>4.     Labour and Health Conditions</strong>

       The Contractor shall comply with all labour and health conditions 
       applicable to the Work.

<strong>5.     Transportation Charges</strong>

       If transportation charges are payable by Canada under the terms of 
       the Contract, shipments are to be made by the most direct and 
       economical means consistent with normal shipping practice, unless 
       otherwise directed (as in the case when transportation costs are 
       part of the unit price).  They are to be shown as a separate item on 
       the invoice.

<strong>6.     Valuation</strong>

       The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks 
       precludes payment of any excess valuation and/or transportation 
       charges beyond the specified FOB point (the point at which title of 
       goods passes to the federal government).  Goods will be covered to 
       the carrier's maximum liability and value will be declared only when 
       additional costs will not be incurred.

<strong>7.     Foreign Shipments</strong>

       Goods shipped into Canada from another country are to be consigned 
       to destination, <strong>in bond</strong>, unless otherwise directed.

<strong>8.     Bill of Lading</strong>

       The transportation bill of lading must accompany the original 
       invoice, except for "collect" shipments (if and when stipulated), in 
       which event it shall accompany the shipment; in addition, a packing 
       slip must accompany each shipment, showing item, quantity, part or 
       reference numbers, description of supplies and contract reference 
       numbers, including the Client Reference Number (CRN) and Procurement 
       Business Number (PBN).  If the supplies have been inspected at the 
       Contractor's plant, the signed inspection voucher must be attached 
       to the packing slip normally enclosed in the packing note envelope.

<strong>9.     Invoice Submission</strong>

       Invoices shall be submitted in the name of the Contractor and shall 
       not be submitted prior to the delivery of supplies or the 
       performance of the services.  They must show the name and address of 
       the consignee, together with date, method of shipment, the case 
       numbers if applicable, item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price, 
       additional charges if applicable, and the Goods and Services Tax or 
       the Harmonized Sales Tax if applicable, part or reference numbers, 
       description of supplies as shown in the Contract, Contract number, 
       requisition number, CRN, PBN and financial code(s).  Separate 
       invoices must be submitted for each shipment and must apply to one 
       contract only.  Each invoice must indicate whether it covers partial 
       or final shipment.

<strong>10.    Inspection and Acceptance</strong> 
       The goods/services are subject to inspection and acceptance by 
       consignee at destination, unless otherwise indicated in the 
       contractual document.

<strong>11.    Standard Clauses, Conditions and Instruction Sets</strong>

       Any standard clause, and any condition or instruction set, used or 
       referenced in a bid solicitation or contract may be updated from 
       time to time.  When this happens, the version used in an 
       already-issued document will remain in effect in that document, 
       unless the updated version is legally incorporated.
