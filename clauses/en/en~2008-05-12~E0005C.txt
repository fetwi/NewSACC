<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks – Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in contracts when bid financial security was required 
in the bid solicitation and the successful bidder must provide a security 
deposit as contract financial security.

Use this clause in conjunction with E0008C.</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor must provide the Contracting Authority with  
       financial security within _____ calendar days after the date of 
       contract award.  The financial security must be in the form of a 
       security deposit as defined in clause E0008C in the amount of $ ______ 
       for the entire contract period, including any extension.

2.     If, for any reason, Canada does not receive the security deposit in 
       the amount set out above within the specified period, the Contractor 
       will be in default.  Canada may, at its discretion, retain the bid 
       financial security and accept another bid, reject all bids or issue 
       a new bid solicitation.

3.     If the security deposit is in the form of government guaranteed 
       bonds with coupons, all coupons that are unmatured at the time the 
       security deposit is provided must be attached to the bonds.  The 
       Contractor must provide written instructions concerning the action 
       to be taken with respect to coupons that will mature while the bonds 
       are pledged as security, when such coupons are in excess of the 
       security deposit requirement.

4.     If the security deposit is in the form of a bill of exchange, Canada 
       will deposit the bill of exchange in an open account in the 
       Consolidated Revenue Fund.  Bills of exchange that are deposited to 
       the credit of the Consolidated Revenue Fund will bear simple 
       interest, calculated on the basis of the rates which are in effect 
       during the period the deposit is held.

       These rates are published monthly by the Department of Finance and 
       are set to be equal to the average yield on 90-day Treasury Bills, 
       less 1/8 of 1 percent.  Interest will be paid annually or, when the 
       security deposit is returned to the Contractor, if earlier. The 
       Contractor may, however, request Canada to hold and not cash the 
       bill of exchange, in which case no interest will become payable.

5.     Canada may convert the security deposit to the use of Canada if any 
       circumstance exists which would entitle Canada to terminate the 
       Contract for default, but any such conversion will not constitute 
       termination of the Contract.

6.     When Canada so converts the security deposit:

       (a)    the proceeds will be used by Canada to complete the Work 
              according to the conditions of the Contract, to the nearest 
              extent that it is feasible to do so and any balance left will 
              be returned to the Contractor on completion of the warranty 
              period; and

       (b)    if Canada enters into a contract to have the Work completed, 
              the Contractor will:
 
              (i)    be considered to have irrevocably abandoned the Work; 
                     and

              (ii)   remain liable for the excess cost of completing the 
                     Work if the amount of the security deposit is not 
                     sufficient for such purpose. "Excess cost" means any 
                     amount over and above the amount of the Contract Price 
                     remaining unpaid together with the amount of the 
                     security deposit.

7.     If Canada does not convert the security deposit to the use of Canada 
       before completion of the contract period, Canada will return the 
       security deposit to the Contractor within a reasonable time after 
       such date.

8.     If Canada converts the security deposit for reasons other than 
       bankruptcy, the financial security must be reestablished to the 
       level of the amount stated above so that this amount is continued 
       and available until completion of the contract period.
