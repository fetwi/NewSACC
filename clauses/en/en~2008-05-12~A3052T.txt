<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in competitive bid solicitations for multiple items 
(line item) when competition is solely limited to Canadian goods and the 
certification must be done on an item by item basis as defined in paragraph 3 
(b) of clause A3050T.

Contracting officers must select one of the options provided in the clause.

Use clause A3053T for multiple items when the certification must be done on an 
aggregate basis.

Use this clause in conjunction with A3050T and A3060C.

Follow these instructions only if the medium complexity (2T-MED1) or higher 
complexity (2T-HIGH1) template is not used.  Contracting officers must consult 
the procedures 2T-PROC1 to confirm they cannot use the template for the 
requirement.

1.	Insert one of the following options at the end of the clause :

	Option 1:  use this paragraph when bidders must submit a completed 
certification with their bid.

"Failure to provide this certification completed with the bid will render the 
bid non-responsive."

	Option 2: use this paragraph when bidders should submit a completed 
certification with their bid but if the certification is not submitted with the 
bid, contracting officers will request the bidder to submit the certification 
within a time frame.

"Bidders should submit this certification completed with their bid.  If the 
certification is not completed and submitted with the bid, the Contracting 
Authority will so inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder with a time frame 
within which to submit this completed certification.  Failure to comply with the 
request of the Contracting Authority and submit the completed certification will 
render the bid non-responsive."

2.	Use this clause in conjunction with A3015T.

Contracting officers must review the Canadian Content Policy (Supply Manual, 
Chapter 5 and Annex 5.1) to establish if the requirement is subject to the 
policy.</pre>
