Annex ____.  The Contractor must maintain the required insurance coverage 
for the duration of the Contract.  Compliance with the insurance

days after the date of award of the Contract a Certificate of Insurance 
including details of the insurance coverage, exclusions, deductibles and

Contracting Authority, forward to Canada a certified true copy of all 
applicable insurance policies.
