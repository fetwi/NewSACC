<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
 Use the following clause in contracts for ship repair (including emergencies) 
and conversion contractual documents.  Note that general contractors who are 
only performing casual and intermittent work on ships (e.g. welders) may not 
have a specialized policy.  Commercial General Liability clause
 
  G2001C
 
 , 
including option (p) of paragraph 2, should be used accordingly.

Whenever the liabilities of Canada and the contractor with respect to the 
contract are difficult to separate, contracting officers must replace paragraph 
2. (a) by the following option:

"Additional Named Insured: Canada is added as an additional named insured, but 
only with respect to liability arising out of the performance of the Contract."

Contracting officers must choose option (f) in paragraph 2 below when applicable 
to their contract.

Contracting officers must consult

 if the suggested limit of $10,000,000 per accident 
or occurrence is not considered adequate as alternate limits may be established.

Canada reserves the right to co-defend any action brought against
Canada. All expenses incurred by Canada to co-defend such actions
will be at Canada's expense. If Canada decides to co-defend any
action brought against it, and Canada does not agree to a proposed
settlement agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and the
plaintiff(s) that would result in the settlement or dismissal of
the action against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the
Contractor's insurer for any difference between the proposed
settlement amount and the amount finally awarded or paid to the
plaintiffs (inclusive of costs and interest) on behalf of
Canada.</p></li>
