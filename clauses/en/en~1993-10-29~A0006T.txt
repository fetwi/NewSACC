   submitted to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
   setting out the alternative means by which several technical, 
   performance, time and other goals and objectives may be best met, having 
   regard to stated mandatory requirements. The Minister will consider

   proposal which will be determined having regard to the evaluation 
   factors set out in this RFP. In addition, the acceptability of the 
   contract terms and conditions upon which the respondent would be
