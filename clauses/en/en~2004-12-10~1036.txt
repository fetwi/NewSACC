       Conditions, provided that, in the event of any inconsistencies 
       between the provisions of the General Conditions and of these 
       supplemental general conditions, the latter shall prevail.

       to whom the same are payable, and shall, from time to time, promptly 
       advise the Minister of any and all claims or arrangements made or 
       proposed which would or might result in further or different 
       payments by way of royalties being made by the Contractor or any of 
       its subcontractors.
 
2.     The Contractor shall not pay, and shall direct its subcontractors

       subject to such conditions as the Minister may impose.

3.     Subject to compliance by the Contractor with the foregoing 
       provisions, Canada shall relieve and indemnify the Contractor from 
       and against all claims, actions, or proceedings for payment of such 
       royalties in cases where the Minister withholds such consent.
