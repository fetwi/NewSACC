If any part of the Specifications provides for a method of construction or 
for the supply and/or use of materials, equipment or parts which are not

       the provisions imposed upon it by this Contract, the Contractor will 
       reimburse Canada within thirty (30) days thereafter for any such

<strong>1029   08     (2004-12-10)  Where Vessel Remains in Commission</strong>

If the vessel is to remain in commission while the Work is being carried 
out, then
 
(a)    the Work shall be carried out on the vessel at such place as the 
       vessel is from time to time berthed, provided that every endeavour 
       shall be made consistent with the necessity for speedy execution of 
       the Work to have the vessel berthed at such place as will facilitate 
       the Work required to be performed thereon by the Contractor;

(b)    the Contractor shall not be in charge of or responsible for the care 
       and protection of the vessel but shall be liable for all loss or 
       damage or personal injury (to persons other than those in the employ 
       of the Contractor) resulting from any negligent or wrongful act or 
       omission on the part of the Contractor, its officers, servants, 
       agents or employees during the carrying out of the Work.  If any 
       such loss or damage should occur to the vessel or to the Work, the 
       Contractor shall forthwith, unless otherwise directed by the 
       Minister or the Inspector and subject to such conditions as the 
       Minister or the Inspector may impose, at its own expense, repair, 
       restore and/or replace the vessel and/or the Work so lost or 
       destroyed.  The Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Canada 
       and the Minister against and from all loss, damages, costs and 
       expenses arising from or in any way connected with any and all 
       claims for or in respect of such loss, damages or personal injuries 
       occasioned as aforesaid.  

<strong>1029   09     (2004-12-10)  Where Vessel out of Commission</strong>

If the vessel be out of commission while the Work is being carried out, 
then

(a)    unless the prior approval of the Minister has been obtained to 
       ground the vessel, it shall be berthed where it will not touch the 
       ground at either high or low water;

(b)    the Contractor shall be in charge of and be entirely responsible for 
       the care and efficient protection of the vessel from the time of 
       delivery thereof to the Contractor until redelivered to and accepted 
       by the person or persons appointed by the Minister to receive and 
       accept the same;

(c)    a copy of all lists of fixtures and spare gear will be furnished to 
       the Contractor who shall check the same in conjunction with the 
       Inspector and thereafter acknowledge receipt of the items set forth 
       therein; upon completion of the work, if such items are accounted 
       for to the satisfaction of the Inspector, a clearance will be given 
       to the Contractor;

(d)    the Contractor shall provide the necessary warehouse or storage 
       accommodation for and maintain in good conditions, lubricated, 
       painted and protected from the weather, all equipment, fittings, 
       articles or things temporarily removed from the vessel during the 
       Work or which may be supplied to the Contractor by Canada for 
       stowing or fitting in place on board the vessel prior to delivery 
       thereof to Canada, and shall redeliver the same to Canada in as good 
       condition as when so removed by or supplied to the Contractor.  The 
       Contractor shall also provide safe storage accommodation for any 
       part or parts of the vessel permanently removed until the same are 
       disposed of as hereinbefore provided;

(e)    the Contractor shall take the usual and proper precautions to 
       maintain in a proper state of preservation any machinery, equipment, 
       fittings, stores or things left in the vessel which might become 
       damaged by exposure;

(f)    if the Work hereunder necessitates the removal of stores and no 
       secure place of stowage is available on board the vessel, the 
       Contractor shall provide the necessary labour for removal and a 
       secure place for storage.  The Contractor shall furnish receipts for 
       such stores.  The Contractor undertakes that such stores shall be 
       well and carefully stored and not mingled with property of a similar 
       nature;

(g)    the Contractor shall be liable for all loss or damage of or to the 
       vessel or the Work and for personal injury (to persons other than 
       those in the employ of the Contractor) resulting from any negligent 
       or wrongful act or omission on the part of the Contractor, its 
       officers, servants, agents or employees from the time of the taking 
       over of the vessel until delivery of the vessel and final acceptance 
       of the Work pursuant to the provisions hereof.  If any such loss or 
       damage should occur prior to such delivery and final acceptance, the 
       Contractor shall forthwith (unless otherwise directed by the 
       Minister or the Inspector and subject to such conditions as the 
       Minister or the Inspector may impose), at its own expense, repair, 
       restore and/or replace the vessel and/or the Work so lost or damaged. 
       Neither Canada nor the Minister shall be in any manner responsible 
       or liable for any loss or damage which shall or may happen to the 
       vessel and/or the Work, or any part or parts thereof (prior to 
       delivery as herein provided), or for any injury including injuries 
       resulting in death, to any person or persons, or for any other 
       damages or injuries whatsoever, caused by or in connection with the 
       vessel, or caused by or resulting from or in any way arising out of 
       the Work, and the Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless 
       Canada and the Minister against and from all loss, costs, damages 
       and expenses arising from or in any way connected with any and all 
       claims for or in respect of such loss, damages or injuries.

<strong>1029   10     (2004-12-10)  Insurance</strong>

The Contractor warrants that it is carrying Shipbuilders' and/or Ship 
Repairers' Liability insurance in the amount stated in the agreement and 
hereby agrees to maintain the said insurance in force during the carrying 
out of the Contract; and the Contractor further agrees that, in the event 
of any loss or liability covered by the said insurance being suffered or 
incurred by or in relation to the vessel or to the Work, the said insurance 
shall be available for the benefit of Canada as Canada's interest may 
appear.

<strong>1029   11     (1991-06-01)  Public Ceremony</strong>

The Contractor shall not allow any public ceremony in connection with the 
Work without having previously obtained the written permission of the 
Minister.

1.     The security (if any) referred to in the agreement shall be held and 
       retained by Canada as security for the due and complete performance, 
       observance and fulfilment by the Contractor of all the covenants and 
       provisions of the Contract.  Unless and until the security is 
       forfeited to Canada as herein provided, Canada shall remit any 
       revenues and income therefrom (provided that Canada shall in no 
       event be obligated to invest moneys as interest or otherwise) to the 
       Contractor, and in the case of interest coupons, or dividend coupons 
       payable to bearer, shall deliver the same to the Contractor as and 
       when they mature.  In the event of any default by the Contractor in 
       fulfilment of any of the terms and conditions of the Contract, the 
       security shall (without prejudice to any and all other rights and 
       recourses accruing to Canada) be forfeited to and retained by Canada 
       as liquidated damages and not as a penalty but, if the Contractor 
       shall have duly performed, observed and fulfilled all the covenants, 
       terms and conditions of the Contract, the security shall be returned 
       to the Contractor.

2.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Minister may, at its discretion, 
       authorize a return of the security to the Contractor at any time 
       before the Contractor has fulfilled all its obligations under the 
       Contract.  In such event, the return of the security shall not 
       prejudice any rights or recourse accruing to Canada under the 
       Contract.
