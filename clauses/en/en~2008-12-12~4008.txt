<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use the following supplemental general conditions only when the contractor must 
collect and/or use personal information about individuals to perform the work 
(e.g., processing individuals' health information).  Before including these 
supplemental general conditions in the contract, contracting officers must 
consult with Legal Services to ensure they are necessary.
 </p>
<p>
  These conditions do not specifically address the numerous policies that apply to 
Canada's use and handling of personal information, such as the Treasury Board 
(TB) Privacy Impact Assessment Policy and Guidelines, the various
  <abbr title="Treasury Board">
   TB
  </abbr>
  policies 
concerning privacy and data protection, and the
  <abbr title="Treasury Board">
   TB
  </abbr>
  Policy on Management of 
Information Technology.  Any additional requirements necessitated by these 
policies will need to be reflected elsewhere in the contract.
 </p>
<p>
  Contracting officers must consult Legal Services if there are concerns about the 
personal information being stored in Canada, to determine whether it would also 
be appropriate to use clause
  
   A9122C
  
  .
 </p>
<p>
  When more than one supplemental general conditions apply to the requirement, 
contracting officers must list the  supplemental general conditions in the 
priority of documents clause in ascending order based on the identification 
number.
