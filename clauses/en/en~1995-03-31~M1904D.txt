<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks – Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>The purpose of form "Call-Up Against a Standing Offer" (DSS-MAS 944) or 
"Commande subséquente à une offre permanente" (DSS-MAS 945) is to allow an 
Identified User to issue a single call-up against various standing offers (not 
to exceed $40,000) to a single supplier who is the authorized agent of different 
offerors, when those offerors each hold a valid Standing Offer with Canada for 
identified goods.

The following clause should be included in all Requests for A Standing Offer 
(RFSO) where form DSS-MAS 944 or DSS-MAS 945 are to be used as a call-up 
document in addition to the current DSS-MAS 942.  Should an offeror not agree 
that its agent may represent the holder of a Standing Offer other than itself 
and that its prices may appear on a multiple call-up form, then the clause 
should not be included in any subsequent Standing Offer and Call-up Authority 
for that offer.

Only one invoice will be issued per call-up.  Call-ups issued using form DSS-MAS 
944 or DSS-MAS 945 are not, under any circumstances, to be issued in order to 
prevent competition.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Offeror agrees and accepts that its agent(s) listed on this 
       Standing Offer may represent the holder of a Standing Offer other 
       than itself. The Offeror further agrees  and accepts that its prices, 
       along with those prices offered by those other offerors, will appear 
       on the multiple call-up form, thereby making the prices specified 
       public information.

2.     The Offeror agrees to the disclosure of its prices and further 
       agrees that it shall have no right to claim against Canada, the 
       Minister, the Identified User, their employees, agents or servants, 
       or any of them, in relation to such disclosure.  The Offeror shall 
       also indemnify Canada, the Minister, the Identified User, their 
       employees, agent or servants, and any of them, against any action, 
       suit, demand, right or claim asserted by anyone as a result of such 
       disclosure.

3.     The Offeror is responsible for delivery in the event of default by 
       the agent for those products only that are normally offered by the 
       Offeror.

4.     The Identified User agrees that if the agent defaults on one or more 
   items, the call-up using DSS-MAS 944 or DSS-MAS 945 cannot be terminated 
   in whole, but only for those portions relating to goods or services 
   specified in the particular Standing Offer to which the default relates 
   and only after the Offeror has been provided with a reasonable 
   opportunity to remedy the default.
