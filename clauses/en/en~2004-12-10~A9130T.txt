<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     As the resulting contract will require the production of or access 
       to controlled goods that are subject to the <em>Defence Production Act</em>, 
       bidders are hereby advised that within Canada only persons who are 
       registered, exempt or excluded under the Controlled Goods Program 
       (CGP) are lawfully entitled to examine, possess or transfer 
       controlled goods.  Details on how to register under the GCP are 
       available at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http://www.cgp.gc.ca</strong>, and registration is carried out 
       as follows:

       (a)    When the bid solicitation document includes controlled goods 
              information or technology, the Bidder must be registered, 
              exempt or excluded under the CGP prior to receiving the bid 
              solicitation document.  Requests for technical data packages 
              or specifications related to the controlled goods should be 
              made in writing to the Contracting Authority identified 
              herein and must contain the CGP registration number or 
              written proof of exemption or exclusion of the Bidder and any 
              other person to whom the Bidder will give access to the 
              controlled goods.

       (b)    When the bid solicitation document does not include 
              controlled goods information or technology but the resulting 
              contract requires the production of or access to controlled 
              goods, the potential contractor and any subcontractor who 
              will be producing or accessing controlled goods must be 
              registered, exempt or excluded under the CGP prior to 
              examining, possessing or transferring controlled goods.

       (c)    When the Contractor and any subcontractor proposed to examine, 
              possess or transfer controlled goods are not registered, 
              exempt or excluded under the CGP at time of contract award, 
              the Contractor and any subcontractor shall, within seven (7) 
              working days from receipt of written notification of contract 
              award, ensure that the required application(s) for 
              registration or exemption are submitted to the CGP.  No 
              examination, possession or transfer of controlled goods shall 
              be performed until the Contractor has provided proof, 
              satisfactory to the Contracting Authority, that the 
              Contractor and any subcontractor are registered, exempt, or 
              excluded under the CGP. 

              Failure of the Contractor to provide proof, satisfactory to 
              the Contracting Authority, that the Contractor and any 
              subcontractor are registered, exempt or excluded under the 
              CGP, within thirty (30) days from receipt of written 
              notification of contract award, shall be a default under the 
              Contract except to the extent that Canada is responsible for 
              the failure due to delay in processing the application.

2.     Bidders are advised that all information on the Application for 
       Registration (or exemption) Form will be verified and errors or 
       inaccuracies may cause significant delays and/or result in denial of 
       registration or exemption.
