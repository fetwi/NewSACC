<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     <strong>Financial Capability Requirement</strong>: The Offeror must have the 
       financial capability to fulfill this requirement. To determine the 
       Offeror's financial capability, the Standing Offer Authority may, by 
       written notice to the Offeror, require the submission of some or all 
       of the financial information detailed below during the evaluation of 
       offers. The Offeror must provide the following information to the 
       Standing Offer Authority within fifteen (15) working days of the 
       request or as specified by the Standing Offer Authority in the 
       notice:

       (a)    Audited financial statements, if available, or the unaudited 
              financial statements (prepared by the Offeror's outside 
              accounting firm, if available, or prepared in-house if no 
              external statements have been prepared) for the Offeror's 
              last three fiscal years, or for the years that the Offeror 
              has been in business if this is less than three years 
              (including, as a minimum, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of 
              Retained Earnings, the Income Statement and any notes to the 
              statements).

       (b)    If the date of the financial statements in (a) above is more 
              than five months before the date of the request for 
              information by the Standing Offer Authority, the Offeror must 
              also provide, unless this is prohibited by legislation for 
              public companies, the last quarterly financial statements 
              (consisting of a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income 
              Statement), as of two months before the date on which the 
              Standing Offer Authority requests this information.

       (c)    If the Offeror has not been in business for at least one full 
              fiscal year, the following must be provided:

              (i)    the opening Balance Sheet on commencement of business 
                     (in the case of a corporation, the date of 
                     incorporation); and

              (ii)   the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of 
                     a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement) 
                     as of two months before the date on which the Standing 
                     Offer Authority requests this information.

       (d)    A certification from the Chief Financial Officer or an 
              authorized signing officer of the Offeror that the financial 
              information provided is complete and accurate.

       (e)    A confirmation letter from all of the financial institution(s) 
              that have provided short-term financing to the Offeror 
              outlining the total of lines of credit granted to the Offeror 
              and the amount of credit that remains available and not drawn 
              upon as of one month prior to the date on which the Standing 
              Offer Authority requests this information.

2.     If the Offeror is a joint venture, the financial information 
       required by the Standing Offer Authority must be provided by each 
       member of the joint venture.

3.     If the Offeror is a subsidiary of another company, then any 
       financial information in 1. (a) to (e) above required by the 
       Standing Offer Authority must be provided by  the ultimate parent 
       company. Provision of parent company financial information does not 
       satisfy the requirement for the provision of the financial 
       information of the Offeror, and the financial capability of a parent 
       cannot be substituted for the financial capability of the Offeror 
       itself unless an agreement by the parent company to sign a Parental 
       Guarantee, as drawn up by Public Works and Government Services 
       Canada (PWGSC), is provided with the required information.

4.     <strong>Financial Information Already Provided to PWGSC</strong>: The Offeror is not 
       required to resubmit any financial information requested by the 
       Standing Offer Authority that is already on file at PWGSC with the 
       Cost and Price Analysis Group of the Policy, Risk, Integrity and 
       Strategic Management Sector, provided that within the above-noted 
       time frame:

       (a)    the Offeror identifies to the Standing Offer Authority in 
              writing the specific information that is on file and the 
              requirement for which this information was provided; and

       (b)    the Offeror authorizes the use of the information for this 
              requirement.

       It is the Offeror's responsibility to confirm with the Standing 
       Offer Authority that this information is still on file with PWGSC.

5.     <strong>Other Information:</strong> Canada reserves the right to request from the 
       Offeror any other information that Canada requires to conduct a 
       complete financial capability assessment of the Offeror.

6.     <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> If the Offeror provides the information required 
       above to Canada in confidence while indicating that the disclosed 
       information is confidential, then Canada will treat the information 
       in a confidential manner as permitted by the <em>Access to Information 
       Act</em>, R.S., 1985, c. A-1, Section 20(1) (b) and (c).

7.     <strong>Security: </strong>In determining the Offeror's financial capability to 
       fulfill this requirement, Canada may consider any security the 
       Offeror is capable of providing, at the Offeror's sole expense (for 
       example, an irrevocable letter of credit from a registered financial 
       institution drawn in favour of Canada, a performance guarantee from 
       a third party or some other form of security, as determined by 
       Canada).
