The Contractor shall provide the Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) 
with the accommodation and facilities required for the proper 
accomplishment of GQA and shall provide any assistance required by the QAR 
for evaluation, verification, validation, documentation or release of 
product.

The QAR shall have the right of access to any area of the Contractor's or 
subcontractor's facilities where any part of the Work is being performed. 
The QAR shall be afforded unrestricted opportunity to evaluate and verify
