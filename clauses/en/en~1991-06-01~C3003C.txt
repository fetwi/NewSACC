in respect of goods and services originating outside of Canada as detailed 
in form DSS-MAS 9411, Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments, which forms part 
of this Contract.

2.  The foreign currency component is defined as the element of the price

Canadian goods and services tax and excise taxes of an ad valorem nature on 
imported items, as well as customs duty, but includes any transportation 
costs payable in foreign currency.

based upon foreign currency component expressed in the foreign currency of 
the item or service (see section A of form DSS-MAS 9411) with appropriate 
adjustments in the foreign exchange rate from the rate specified at section 
B of the form.  Such increases or decreases in the rate shall be based on 
the date of payment for the goods by Canada.  In any event, price 
adjustments will cease, unless otherwise provided for in the Contract, when 
the value of the foreign currency component identified at paragraph 3 is 
reached.

5.  On each invoice submitted against the Contract, the Contractor will 
   show the exchange rate adjustment factor (either upward, downward or no 
   change) as a separate item on the invoice and provide a copy of form 
   DSS-MAS 9411 with Part II fully completed.  The documentation is to show 
   the date(s) the goods were actually shipped for clearance through 
   customs into Canada, supported by a copy of the relevant shipping 
   document.  In the case of delivery made after the delivery date 
   specified in the Contract, Canada will select the exchange rate most 
   advantageous to it within the 30-day period after the specified delivery 
   date.
