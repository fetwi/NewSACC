<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The following are subject to government audit before or after 
payment is made:

       (a)    The amount claimed under the conditions of the Contract, as 
              computed in accordance with the Basis of Payment, including 
              time charged and salaries paid for labour charges based on 
              salaries times a firm negotiated multiplier.

       (b)    The accuracy of the Contractor's time recording system.

       (c)    The estimated amount of profit in any firm-priced element, 
              firm time rate, firm overhead rate, or firm salary multiplier, 
              for which the Contractor has provided the appropriate 
              certification.  The purpose of the audit is to determine 
              whether the actual profit earned on a single contract if only 
              one exists, or the aggregate of actual profit earned by the 
              Contractor on a series of negotiated contracts containing one 
              or more of the prices, time rates or multipliers mentioned 
              above, during a particular period selected, is fair and 
              reasonable based on the estimated amount of profit included 
              in earlier price or rate certification(s).

       (d)    Any firm-priced element, firm time rate, firm overhead rate, 
              or firm salary multiplier for which the Contractor has 
              provided a "most favoured customer" certification.  The 
              purpose of such audit is to determine whether the Contractor 
              has charged anyone else, including the Contractor's most 
              favoured customer, lower prices, rates or multipliers, for 
              like quality and quantity of goods or services.

2.     Any payments made pending completion of the audit must be regarded 
       as interim payments only and must be adjusted to the extent 
       necessary to reflect the results of the said audit.  If there has 
       been any overpayment, , the Contractor must repay Canada the amount 
       found to be in excess.
