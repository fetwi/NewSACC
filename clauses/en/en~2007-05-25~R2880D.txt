<strong>GC8.1  (2007-05-25)  Interpretation</strong><strong></strong>

1)     In these Dispute Resolution, an "arbitral question of law" means a 
       question of law that

       (a)    is capable of determination by arbitration under the laws of 
              Canada;

       (b)    does not involve interpretation or application of public law 
              of Canada, including without limitation any matter of 
              constitutional, administrative, criminal or tax law; and

       (c)    concerns

              (i)    the formation, validity, interpretation, application 
                     or enforceability of the Contract;

              (ii)   the performance, breach, termination or other 
                     discharge of the Contract;

              (iii)  the rights, duties, obligations or remedies of parties 
                            created by or pursuant to the Contract; or

              (iv)   any other issue of private law that may arise between 
                     parties relative to performance of the Contract.

       "dispute" means any disagreement regarding any issue identified by 
       the Contractor in the notice submitted to Canada in accordance with 
       paragraph 2) of GC8. 3, "Notice of Dispute", and includes any claim 
       by the Contractor arising from such disagreement and any 
       counterclaim by Canada, but does not include any claim by either 
       party for punitive or exemplary damages, injury to persons, death, 
       or any claim based on an allegation of libel or slander; and

2)     The alternative dispute resolution procedures set out in GC8, do not 
       apply to any claim by Canada against the Contractor except any 
       counterclaim in a dispute as defined in paragraph 1 of GC8.1, 
       including, but not limited to, any claim of setoff regarding any 
       amount due to Canada under GC5.10, "Assessment and Damages for Late 
       Completion".

<strong>GC8.2  (2007-05-25)  Consultation and Co-operation</strong>

1)     The parties agree to maintain open and honest communication 
       throughout the performance of the Contract.

2)     The parties agree to consult and co-operate with each other in the 
       furtherance of the Work and the resolution of problems or 
       differences that may arise.

<strong>GC8.3  (2007-05-25)  Notice of Dispute</strong>

1)     Any difference between the parties to the Contract of any nature 
       arising out of or in connection with the Contract which could result 
       in a claim by the Contractor against Canada, and which is not 
       settled by consultation and co-operation as envisaged in GC8.2, "
       Consultation and Co-operation", shall be resolved in the first 
       instance by Canada, whose written decision or direction shall be 
       final and binding subject only to the provisions of GC8.  Such 
       written decision or direction includes, but is not limited to, any 
       written decision or direction by Canada under any provision of the 
       General Conditions.

2)     The Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted the decision or 
       direction of Canada referred to in paragraph 1) of GC8.3 and to have 
       expressly waived and released Canada from any claim in respect of 
       the particular matter dealt with in that decision or direction 
       unless, within 15 working days after receipt of the decision or 
       direction, the Contractor submits to Canada a written notice of 
       dispute requesting formal negotiation under GC8.4, "Negotiation".  
       Such notice shall refer specifically to GC8.4, "Negotiation", and 
       shall specify the issues in contention and the relevant provisions 
       of the Contract.

3)     The giving of a written notice in accordance with paragraph 2) of 
       GC8.3 shall not relieve the Contractor from complying with the 
       decision or direction that is the subject of the dispute.  Such 
       compliance, however, shall not be construed as an admission by the 
       Contractor of the correctness of such decision or direction.

4)     If a dispute is not resolved promptly, Canada shall give such 
       instructions as, in Canada's opinion, are necessary for the proper 
       performance of the Work and to prevent delays pending a resolution 
       of the matter.  Unless Canada terminates the Contract, orders the 
       Contractor to suspend the Work, or takes the Work out of the hands 
       of the Contractor, the Contractor shall continue to perform the Work 
       in accordance with the provisions and requirements of the Contract 
       and the instructions of Canada.  Such performance shall not 
       prejudice any claim that the Contractor may have.

5)     Nothing in GC8, relieves the Contractor from its obligation to 
       provide any other notice required by the Contract within the time 
       specified in the Contract, including, but not limited to, any notice 
       required under GC6.2, "Changes in Subsurface Conditions".

<strong>GC8.4  (2007-05-25)  Negotiation</strong>

1)     Within 10 working days after receipt by Canada of a notice referred 
       to in paragraph 2) of GC8.3, "Notice of Dispute", or within such 
       other period of time as may be mutually agreed to, the parties shall 
       commence formal negotiations in order to resolve the dispute.  
       Negotiations shall occur initially between representatives of the 
       Contractor and Canada who play a direct supervisory role in the 
       performance, administration or management of the Contract.

2)     If the representatives referred to in paragraph 1) of GC8.4 are 
       unable to resolve some or all of the issues which are the subject of 
       the negotiations within 10 working, the parties shall refer the 
       remaining issues which are in dispute to a second level of 
       negotiation between a principal or principals of the Contractor and 
       a senior level manager or senior level managers representing Canada.

3)     If negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within 30 working days 
       from the date of delivery of the notice referred to in paragraph 2) 
       of GC8.3, "Notice of Dispute", or within such longer period as may 
       have been agreed to by the parties, the Contractor may, by giving 
       written notice to Canada, in accordance with GC2.3, "Notices", 
       within 10 working days from the end of such period, request that 
       mediation be undertaken to assist the parties to reach agreement on 
       the outstanding issues.

4)     If the Contractor does not request mediation within the period 
       permitted by paragraph 3) of GC8.4, the Contractor shall be deemed 
       to have accepted the decision or direction of Canada under paragraph 
       1) of GC8.3, "Notice of Dispute", and to have expressly waived and 
       released Canada from any claim in respect of the particular matter 
       dealt with in that decision or direction.

<strong>GC8.5  (2007-05-25)  Mediation</strong>

1)     If the Contractor has requested mediation in accordance with 
       paragraph 3) of GC8.4, "Negotiation", mediation shall be conducted 
       in accordance with GC8.10, "Rules for Mediation of Disputes".

2)     If a Project Mediator has not previously been appointed for the 
       purposes of the Contract, a Project Mediator shall be appointed in 
       accordance with GC8.10, "Rules for Mediation of Disputes", forthwith 
       after delivery of a notice in accordance with paragraph 3) of GC8.4, 
       "Negotiation", requesting mediation.

3)     If the dispute has not been resolved within

       (a)    10 working days following the appointment of a Project 
              Mediator in accordance with paragraph 2) of GC8.5, if a 
              Project Mediator was not previously appointed;

       (b)    10 working days following receipt by Canada of a written 
              notice in accordance with paragraph 3) of GC8.4, "Negotiation
              ", if a Project Mediator was previously appointed; or

       (c)    such other longer period as may have been agreed to by the 
              parties;

       the Project Mediator shall terminate the mediation by giving written 
       notice to the parties stating the effective date of termination.

<strong>GC8.6  (2007-05-25)  Binding Arbitration</strong>

1)     If mediation of the dispute is terminated pursuant to the provisions 
       of GC8.5, "Mediation", and

       (a)    the termination of mediation occurs prior to the applicable 
              date set out in paragraph 4) of GC8.6; and

       (b)    the disputed issues involve issues of fact or issues of 
              arbitral questions of law or issues of mixed fact and 
              arbitral questions of law;

       either party, by giving notice in writing to the other party in 
       accordance with GC2.3, "Notices", may require that the dispute be 
       resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to GC8.6.

2)     A notice referred to in paragraph 1) of GC8.6 shall be given within 
       10 working days of the date of termination of mediation under GC8.5 
       Mediation and shall be in accordance with GC2.3, "Notices".

3)     If no notice is given within the period set out in paragraph 2) of 
       GC8.6, or if the conditions set out in subparagraphs 1)(a) and 1)(b) 
       of GC8.6 are not met, the arbitration provisions set out in GC8.6 do 
       not apply to the dispute.

4)     Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration of the dispute shall be 
       held in abeyance until the earlier of

       (a)    the date of issuance of a Certificate of Substantial 
              Performance under GC5.5, "Substantial Performance of the Work
              ";

       (b)    the date the Work is taken out of the Contractor's hands; and

       (c)    the date of termination of the Contract;

       and consolidated with all other such disputes into a single 
       arbitration. 

5)     Arbitral proceedings under this GC8.6 shall be governed by and 
       conducted in accordance with the <em>Commercial Arbitration Act</em>, R.S.C. 
       1985, c. 17 (2nd Supp.) and the provisions of GC8.11, "Rules for 
       Arbitration of Disputes".

6)     For the purposes of calculating time under the Rules for Arbitration 
       referred to in paragraph 5) of GC8.6, arbitration proceedings shall 
       commence on the applicable date set out in paragraph 4) of GC8.6.

7)     Notwithstanding anything else contained in GC8.6, the arbitration 
       provisions in GC8.6 do not apply if the aggregate amount of all 
       claims by the Contractor required to be arbitrated on the applicable 
       date set out in paragraph 4) of GC8.6 is less than $25,000.

<strong>GC8.7  (2007-05-25)  Disputes not Subject to Arbitration</strong>

1)     Where the arbitration provisions in GC8.6, "Binding Arbitration", do 
       not apply to a dispute as a result of paragraphs 3) or 7) of GC8.6, 
       "Binding Arbitration", either party may take such court action or 
       proceedings as it considers appropriate, including, without limiting 
       the foregoing, all suits that would otherwise have been immediately 
       available to it but for the provisions of these Dispute Resolution 
       Conditions.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2) of GC8.7, the 
       Contractor shall initiate any such action or proceeding no later 
       than three calendar months after the date that a Certificate of 
       Completion is issued under GC5.6, "Final Completion", and not 
       afterwards, except where it is otherwise provided by law.

2)     Any action or proceeding resulting from a direction under GC3.13, "
       Warranty and Rectification of Defects in Work", shall be initiated 
       by the Contractor no later than three calendar months after the 
       expiry of the warranty or guarantee period and not afterwards, 
       except where it is otherwise provided by law.

<strong>GC8.8  (2007-05-25)  Confidentiality</strong>

1)     All information exchanged during alternative dispute resolution 
       procedures, by whatever means, shall be without prejudice and shall 
       be treated as confidential by the parties and their representatives, 
       unless otherwise required by law.  However, evidence that is 
       independently admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered 
       inadmissible or non-discoverable by virtue of its use during an 
       alternative dispute resolution process.

<strong>GC8.9  (2007-05-25)  Settlement</strong>

1)     Any agreement to settle all or any part of a dispute, by whatever

       after entry into the Contract, appoint a mediator (the "Project 
       Mediator") to conduct mediation proceedings in accordance with these 
       Rules for Mediation of Disputes, in regard to any dispute that may 
       arise with regard to the interpretation, application or 
       administration of the Contract.  In this case, they shall jointly 
       enter into a contract with the appointed Project Mediator, which 
       contract shall be in a form drafted by the Coordinator and agreed to 
       by the parties.

2)     If the parties do not appoint a Project Mediator pursuant to 
       paragraph 1) of GC8.10.4, the parties shall appoint a Project 
       Mediator within 17 working days following receipt of a written 
       notice from the Contractor, in accordance with GC2.3, "Notices", 
       requesting that mediated negotiations be undertaken in accordance 
       with these Rules to assist the parties to reach agreement on any 
       outstanding issues that may be in dispute.  Any contract entered 
       into with the appointed Project Mediator shall meet the requirements 
       as set out for the contract described in paragraph 1) of GC8.8.4.

3)     When mediation is requested by the Contractor pursuant to paragraph 
       3) of GC8.4, "Negotiation", if the parties have previously entered 
       into a contract with a Project Mediator, the parties shall within 2 
       days send to both the Project Mediator and the Coordinator

       (a)    a copy of the notice requesting negotiation under paragraph 2 
              of GC8.3, "Notice of Dispute";

       (b)    a copy of Canada's written position in relation to the notice, 
              the issues in contention and the relevant provisions of the 
              contract; and

       (c)    a copy of the Contractor's written request for mediation 
              required under paragraph 3 of GC8.4, "Negotiation".

4)     If the parties have not agreed on a Project Mediator, the parties 
       shall forthwith provide the Coordinator with the written materials 
       referred to in subparagraphs 3)(a), 3)(b) and 3)(c) of GC8.10.4 
       together with a request that the Coordinator assist in the 
       appointment of a mutually acceptable Project Mediator in accordance 
       with these Rules.

5)     Within 5 working days following receipt of the request and materials 
       referred to in paragraph 4) of GC8.10.4, the Coordinator shall 
       provide the parties with a list of qualified private sector 
       mediators obtained from an independent and impartial entity, 
       together with instructions to each party to individually and 
       confidentially select and rank their preferred and fully acceptable 
       choices of mediator in descending order.  Each mediator listed shall 
       be impartial and independent of the parties, and shall be an 
       experienced and skilled commercial mediator, preferably with 
       knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute.

6)     Within 10 working days of receipt of the list referred to in 
       paragraph 5) of GC8.10.4 each party shall comply with the 
       instructions accompanying the list(s) and shall deliver the 
       completed listing to the Coordinator.

7)     Within 2 working days following receipt of the completed listings, 
       the Coordinator shall select the highest common ranked mediator to 
       act as Project Mediator for the purposes of the contract.

8)     In the event of a tie, the Coordinator shall consult both parties to 
       re-evaluate their rankings in order to assist the Coordinator in 
       selecting a Project Mediator acceptable to both parties.  If the 
       parties cannot agree upon a Project Mediator, the Coordinator shall 
       forthwith provide the parties with a second list of mediators and 
       the procedure shall be repeated.

9)     If the parties have not previously entered into a contract with a 
       mutually acceptable Project Mediator, the Coordinator shall use 
       reasonable efforts to negotiate a contract with a mutually 
       acceptable Project Mediator on behalf of the parties, which contract 
       shall incorporate or otherwise comply with the provisions of these 
       Rules.  If negotiations are unsuccessful, or if for other reason the 
       individual is unwilling or unable to enter into a contract to act as 
       Project Mediator, the Coordinator shall repeat the process with the 
       second-highest common ranked mediator.

10)    The parties agree that, upon successful completion of the 
       negotiations referred to in paragraph 9) of GC8.10.4, they shall 
       jointly enter into a contract with the selected Project Mediator, 
       which contract shall be in a form drafted by the Coordinator and 
       agreed to by the parties.

11)    Upon execution of the contract with the Project Mediator referred to 
       in paragraph 10) of GC8.10.4 the Coordinator shall provide the 
       Project Mediator with copies of the documents referred to in 
       paragraph 3) of GC8.10.4. 
       <strong>GC8.10.5      Confidentiality</strong>

1)     Subject to paragraph 2) of GC8.10.5, and unless otherwise agreed in 
       writing by the parties, the Project Mediator, the parties and their 
       counsel or representatives shall keep confidential all matters and 
       documents disclosed during mediation proceedings except where the 
       disclosure is necessary for any implementation of any agreement 
       reached or is required by law.

2)     Evidence that is independently admissible or discoverable in any 
       arbitral or judicial proceeding shall not be rendered inadmissible 
       or non-discoverable by virtue of its use in mediation proceedings.

3)     Neither party shall make transcripts, minutes or other records of a 
       mediation conference.

4)     The personal notes and written opinions of the Project Mediator made 
       in relation to mediation are in the Project Mediator's sole 
       possession and control, are confidential, and may not be used in any 
       subsequent proceeding between the parties or where they are opposed 
       in interest without the express written permission of the parties.

5)     All information exchanged during mediation procedures, by whatever 
       means, shall be without prejudice and shall be treated as 
       confidential by the parties and their representatives, unless 
       otherwise required by law.

       <strong>GC8.10.6      Time and Place of Mediation</strong><strong></strong>

1)     The Project Mediator, in consultation with the parties shall set the 
       date, time and place of any mediation conference as soon as possible, 
       bearing in mind that, subject to agreement to the contrary between 
       the parties, only 10 working days are available within which to 
       attempt to settle the dispute.

       <strong>GC8.10.7      Representation</strong>

1)     Representatives of the parties may be accompanied at the mediation 
       conference by legal counsel or any other person.

2)     If the Project Mediator is a lawyer, the Project Mediator shall not 
       provide legal advice to a party during the course of the mediation 
       conference, but may recommend that a party obtain independent legal 
       advice before finalizing a settlement agreement.

       <strong>GC8.10.8      Procedure</strong>

1)     The parties agree to an exchange of all facts, information and 
       documents upon which they intend to rely in any oral or written 
       presentation during the mediation.  This exchange shall be completed 
       no later than 2 working days prior to the date set for a mediation 
       conference.

2)     The Project Mediator shall be free to meet with the parties 
       individually during a mediation conference if the Project Mediator 
       is of the opinion that this may improve the chances of a mediated 
       settlement, and either party may request such an individual meeting 
       at any time.

3)     The parties may agree to extend the 10 working days available for 
       settlement of the dispute through mediation, and the Project 
       Mediator shall record that agreement in writing.

       <strong>GC8.10.9      Settlement Agreement</strong>

1)     The parties shall record in writing any settlement agreement reached, 
       with sufficient detail to ensure a clear understanding of
 
       (a)    the issues resolved;

       (b)    any obligations assumed by each party including criteria to 
              determine if and when these obligations have been met; and
