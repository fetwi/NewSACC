<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The price of the offer will be evaluated as follows:

       (a)    Canadian-based offerors must submit firm prices, Canadian 
              customs duties and excise taxes included, and Goods and 
              Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) excluded.

       (b)    foreign-based offerors must submit firm prices, Canadian 
              customs duties, and excise taxes, and GST or HST excluded. 
              Canadian customs duties and excise taxes payable by Canada 
              will be added, for evaluation purposes only, to the prices 
              submitted by foreign-based offerors.

2.     Although Canada reserves the right to issue the Standing Offer 
       either on an FOB plant or FOB destination, Canada requests that 
       offerors provide prices FOB their plant or shipping point and FOB 
       destination.  Offers will be assessed on an FOB destination basis.  

3.     For the purpose of the request for standing offers, offerors with an 
       address in Canada are considered Canadian-based offerors and 
       offerors with an address outside of Canada are considered 
       foreign-based offerors.
