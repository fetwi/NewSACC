<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Unless otherwise specified in the bid solicitation, bids must be in 
Canadian currency.

2.     Bidders may request Canada to assume the risk for exchange rate 
       fluctuation.  This request must be specifically made at time of 
       bidding.

3.     The foreign currency component is defined as the element of the 
       price that will be directly affected by exchange rate fluctuations.  
       It could include the net price FOB foreign manufacturer's plant, 
       costs associated with applicable duty, excise tax, Goods and 
       Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax, if applicable, entry fees, 
       transportation costs or delivery charges payable in a foreign 
       currency, and any other charges associated with being the importer 
       of record if they originated from and are required to be paid in a 
       foreign currency.

4.     The foreign value of the foreign currency component of the bid or 
       negotiated price must be provided <em>___________ (</em><span class="wsInlineRemark"><strong>insert</strong></span><strong> </strong>"in the bid"<span class="wsInlineRemark"><strong> 
       or</strong></span><strong> </strong>"before contract award"). <strong> </strong>Form PWGSC-TPSGC 9411, Claim for 
       Exchange Rate Adjustments (http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/acquisitions/text/
       forms/forms-e.html), may be used for this purpose.  If milestone 
       payments are proposed, it is recommended to indicate on the above 
       form the foreign currency component associated with each milestone 
       event.

5.     All bids are evaluated in Canadian currency.  Therefore, for 
       evaluation purposes, the rate quoted by the Bank of Canada as being 
       in effect on date of bid closing, or such other date as may be 
       specified in the bid solicitation, will be applied as the initial 
       conversion factor for the specified currency.  (Column 3 of the 
       above form will be completed by the Contracting Authority.)

6.     Rates proposed by bidders will not be accepted for the purposes of 
       this exchange rate adjustment provision.

7.     If there are two (2) identical bids, and provided that the bid 
       selected would still be considered the most advantageous to Canada, 
       preference will be given to the Bidder who assumes all or part of 
       the exchange rate adjustment risk over a bidder who does not assume 
       any of this risk.  Furthermore, preference will be given to the 
       Bidder who assumes all of the exchange rate adjustment risk over a 
       bidder who assumes only part of this risk. 

8.     Canada will pay the exchange rate adjustment amount in Canadian 
       currency using the prevailing rate on the date of payment by Canada 
       or, as applicable, in accordance with one of the following clauses:  
       C3015C, C3020C, C3025C, or C3030C.
