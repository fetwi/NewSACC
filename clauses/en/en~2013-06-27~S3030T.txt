<p>
  Clause S3030T is cancelled because it has been replaced by a Notification to suppliers in the
  <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">
   RFSA
  </abbr>
  Template indicating that the bid solicitation and resulting contract templates would address such specific requirements in the event that the Supply Arrangement would lead to a contract subject to the Federal Contractors Program (FCP) for employment equity.
 </p>
<p>
  Background - In June 2013, a streamlined
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  for employment equity was introduced which changed the obligations of both Contractors and Contracting Authorities in the application of the program.   The threshold for the application of the
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  has been increased to $1M for a bidder, subject to the program, to have an Agreement to Implement Employment Equity (AIEE) in place with
  <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">
   HRSDC
  </abbr>
  -Labour.  Once a bidder is subject to the program it must honour the
  <abbr title="Agreement to Implement Employment Equity">
   AIEE
  </abbr>
  as an on-going obligation and not simply for the period of the contract.  Contractors who do not comply with the
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  or if their
  <abbr title="Agreement to Implement Employment Equity">
   AIEE
  </abbr>
  becomes invalid will be declared ineligible by
  <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">
   HRSDC
  </abbr>
  -Labour and their names will appear on the "
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  Limited Eligibility to Bid" list.  In addition, an ineligible contractor should not be awarded future contracts or issued future standing offers,
  <strong>
   regardless of the value
  </strong>
  of the procurement.
