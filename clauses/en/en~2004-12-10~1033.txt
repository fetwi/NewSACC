the satisfaction of the Inspector any part of the materials or work which 
may have been rejected by the Inspector. 

<strong>1033   06     (2004-12-10)  Economical Execution and Spoilage</strong>

       the purchase and maintenance of inventories of materials and 
       supplies therefor, and shall exercise in respect to the operations

       if it were constructing the vessels for its own account.

2.     The Contractor shall avoid spoilage of materials but, up to the time 
       of final acceptance by Canada of the respective vessels, the cost of 
       correction or replacement of rejected material and workmanship, the 
       cost of rectifications required of component parts or completed 
       vessels, and the cost of any repairs thereto occasioned by or in 
       connection with the demonstration or test or trials thereof shall be 
       part of the cost of the Work under the Contract and the Contractor 
       shall be reimbursed therefor under and in accordance with the 
       provisions hereof, unless the character and total value thereof 
       shall, in the opinion of the Minister, clearly indicate gross 
       mismanagement, wilful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part 
       of the Contractor. 

<strong>1033   07     (2004-12-10)  Provision of Facilities</strong>

materials of every kind required for the performance of the Contract, there 
shall be deducted from the gross cost thereof all cash and trade discounts, 
rebates, credits, salvage, custom duty drawbacks, commissions and other 
allowances as aforesaid.  Such benefits lost through no fault or neglect on

the Work, in whole or in part, and may, from time to time, make 
modifications of, changes in or additions to the Specifications, and all 
orders and directions given by the Minister with respect to the foregoing 
shall be complied with by the Contractor.  The Contractor may, with the 
written approval of the Minister, make any such modifications, changes or 
additions to the Specifications.  Should any such suspension, modification, 
change or addition result in a material increase or decrease in the scope 
of the Work, the Minister may make an adjustment in the Contractor's fee, 
and the Minister's decision as to the adjustment to be made shall be final.

<strong>1033   10     (1991-06-01)  Certificates Required</strong>

It shall be the duty of the Contractor, if so required by the Minister, to

of the vessels (excluding government issue) which may be found defective or 
with signs of weakness of undue wear within such period (owing to faulty 
materials or workmanship) shall be repaired or, at the Contractor's option, 
a new part or parts shall be furnished by the Contractor at the Contractor'
s shipyard without cost to Canada or Canada may repair or replace such 
defective part or parts and the Contractor will pay to Canada the cost of 
such repair or new part or parts not exceeding; however, the cost of a new 
part or parts, FOB the Contractor's shipyard, provided, however, that 
notice of such defective part or parts and of the whereabouts of the vessel 
shall be given by Canada to the Contractor within sixty (60) days following 
discovery of such defect.

purpose of the Work around or about the premises where any part of the Work

such extent as may be required by the Inspector, shall be marked with or 
identified by a statement to that effect) and shall not be removed from the 
said premises without the written consent of the Minister or the Inspector 
provided, however, that all materials and things which are normally kept by 
the Contractor in its common stores for use in its general business shall 
be at the risk of the Contractor until withdrawn by the Contractor for use

<strong>1033   13     (2004-12-10)  Risk of Loss or Damage</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding anything contained in section 12 of these 
       supplemental general conditions and/or any other provision of the 
       Contract, the Contractor shall bear and be subject to all risk of 
       loss or damage of any nature whatsoever (except loss or damage the 
       risk of which is assumed by Canada as provided in subsection 13.3 
       and except as provided in section 6 of these supplemental general 
       conditions) of or to the Work or any part thereof until delivery of 
       the vessels and final acceptance of same pursuant to the provisions 
       hereof.  If any such loss or damage should occur prior to such 
       delivery and final acceptance, the Contractor shall forthwith 
       (unless otherwise directed by the Minister or the Inspector and 
       subject to such conditions as the Minister or the Inspector may 
       impose) at its own expense and without making any claim for 
       reimbursement therefor, repair, restore and/or replace the Work or 
       the part thereof so lost or damaged.

2.     The Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Canada and the 
       Minister against and from any and all claims, damages, loss, costs 
       and expenses (except claims, damages, loss, costs and expenses and 
       risk of which is assumed by Canada as provided in subsection 13.3 
       which Canada and/or the Minister may, at any time or times, suffer 
       or incur as a result of or arising out of any actual or alleged 
       injury to persons (including injuries resulting in death) or damage 
       to property which may be or be alleged to be caused by or suffered 
       as a result of the carrying out of this Contract or any part thereof, 
       whether by the Contractor or by any subcontractor or assignee of the 
       Contractor.

3.     The Contractor shall not (except as and to the extent, if any, 
       specifically required or permitted by the agreement), unless 
       otherwise directed by the Minister, carry, or incur the expense of, 
       any insurance on or in respect of the Work.  Canada hereby assumes 
       the same risk of loss of, damage to and liability in respect of the 
       Work (except to the extent, if any, to which the Contractor is for 
       the time being directed or permitted hereunder to carry insurance) 
       as would have been assumed by the underwriters if the Work had been 
       insured throughout the term of the Contract for full value under the 
       form of builders' risk policy set forth in standard form of Marine 
       Builders' Risk Policy, forming part of the Contract, but excluding 
       therefrom the "Collision" and the "Protection and Indemnity" clauses.

4.     The Contractor will promptly notify the Minister of any action, 
       claim or demand instituted or made in respect of which the 
       Contractor may be entitled to be indemnified by Canada under the 
       provisions of subsection 13.3, and shall furnish to the Minister the 
       originals or true copies of all proceedings and papers received by 
       the Contractor in respect of each such action, claim or demand, and 
       shall, if hereunto requested by the Minister, authorize 
       representatives of the Minister to settle or to direct or to take 
       conduct of the defence of such action, claim or demand, and, in the 
       absence of such request, the Contractor shall diligently proceed 
       with such defence.
 
5.     Canada shall be entitled or subrogated to all rights and remedies of 
       the Contractor and/or any subcontractor against third parties in 
       respect of any loss or damage, the risk of which is assumed by 
       Canada hereunder, and the Contractor and/or the said subcontractors 
       shall, at the expense of Canada , do, concur in doing and permit to 
       be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or as the 
       Minister may direct or require for the purpose of enforcing such 
       rights and remedies.

6.     If the Work or any part thereof shall be lost or damaged by reason 
       of anything the risk whereof is assumed by Canada hereunder, then 
       the Contractor shall, if the Minister so directs, with all possible 
       speed and with equivalent materials and workmanship, repair, rebuild 
       or replace the same in the like state and condition in every respect 
       as before the happening of the said loss or damage, and the 
       reasonable and proper net cost of such repair, rebuilding or 
       replacement (calculated and determined in accordance with the 
       Contract Cost Principles 1031-2 forming part of the Contract) shall 
       be paid or reimbursed to the Contractor as herein provided in 
       respect of the cost of the Work, and, in case such loss or damage 
       shall have happened without the actual fault or privity of the 
       Contractor, Canada will pay to the Contractor, in addition to such 
       cost, a profit or fee in such amount as the Minister shall consider 
       reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances.

7.     The term "Work" and other words relative thereto, or of like "import
       ", wherever used in this section, shall be deemed to include

       (a)    if the Contractor shall not have previously built and 
              launched a vessel of the same class at its shipyard; or

       (b)    if the Contractor is directed by the client department to 
              submit such calculations.

2.     Neither the submission of launching calculations to the Inspector or 
       to the client department nor concurrence therein by the Inspector or 
       the client department shall be deemed to be concurrence by Canada in 
       the adequacy of such calculations.

<strong>1033   17     (1991-06-01)  Public Ceremonies</strong>

The Contractor shall not allow any public ceremony in connection with the

at any time if required by the Minister or the Inspector.

<strong>1033   20     (2004-12-10)  Commissioning of Vessel</strong>

Canada may commission the vessel before or during trials and shall not, by 
reason thereof, be deemed to have accepted the vessel.

<strong>1033   21     (1991-06-01)  Storage of Materials, Parts, etc.</strong>
 
1.     The Contractor shall supply suitable warehouse accommodation for the 
       storage of all materials, parts and equipment regardless of the 
       source of supply thereof, for such length of time as the Minister 
       may direct.

2.     Without limiting the Contractor's responsibility, as provided in the 
       Contract, for the care of materials, parts and equipment in its 
       custody or control, the Contractor shall carry out such maintenance, 
       care, minor repairs, calibration, adjustment, handling, embarking, 
       loading, care after loading and similar duties in respect of 
       materials, parts and equipment in the custody or control of the

       satisfaction of the Inspector and in accordance with such 
       instructions as may be given to the Contractor in writing by the 
       Minister or the Inspector.

2.     The Contractor shall be in charge of the vessel, including the 
       machinery and the electrical installations thereof, and shall

5.     The client department may place a reasonable number of its naval 
       officers and men, including civilian personnel, on board the vessel 
       during the period of trials and, regardless of their duties, they 
       shall have access to any part of the vessel.  The client department 
       shall designate one of such personnel (who may or may not be the 
       Inspector) to be the client department representative, and the 
       Contractor shall appoint one of its personnel to be its senior 
       representative.  All client department personnel will observe the 
       manner in which the Contractor conducts the trials and in the event 
       of danger to the ship or its machinery or equipment or to life and 
       property, they will report to the Contractor's senior representative 
       and to the client department representative.  The Contractor shall 
       comply with any instructions which may be given by the client 
       department representative to the Contractor's senior representative 
       in respect of safety measures to counteract such danger.
