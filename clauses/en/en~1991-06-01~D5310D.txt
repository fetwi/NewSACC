DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE:

1.     All shipments of meat products consigned to the Department of 
       National Defence (DND) must be inspected and stamped as complying 
       with all individual contract specifications by an inspector of the 
       Food Products and Inspection Branch, Agriculture Canada, prior to 
       shipment.

       IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REGISTERED ESTABLISHMENT AWARDED A 
       CONTRACT TO ENSURE THAT:

       (a)    the inspector is notified and is given a copy of the contract; 
              and

       (b)    there is in the possession of the management, the latest 
              issue of the Canadian General Standards Board standards 
              respecting the contract; and these are available to the 
              inspector-in-charge. This is to be confirmed by a letter 
              issued by Department of Public Works and Government Services 
              (DPWGS), signed by plant management and the 
              inspector-in-charge and returned to the area office of DPWGS.

2.     It is a contractual obligation that meat products for the Department 
       of National Defence be inspected, stamped with the official stamp, 
       and date marked at the PLANT OF PRODUCTION. In the case of processed 
       products with a label approval number specified on the contract, the 
       stamping and date marking may be done at the shipping establishment. 
       Plant management must ensure that any product leaving their plant 
       for shipment to DND has been properly stamped by the inspector. A 
       rubber or brass stamp marked "Agriculture Canada Insp. (number)" for 
       G.C. is available on request. The stamp must remain under the 
       control of the inspector-in-charge. A log of each occasion when the 
       stamp is used shall be kept indicating date, stamp number, type and 
       quantity of product, destination and contract number.

3.     After the inspector has verified that the shipment meets all 
       contract requirements and that each container has been date stamped, 
       each container must be legibly stamped using the "Agriculture Canada 
       Insp. (number)" for G.C. stamp prior to shipment. In the case of 
       beef carcasses, each quarter must have two stamp impressions or 
       eight per carcass. Hog, veal, lamb and mutton carcasses must have 
       three stamp impressions per side or six per carcass.

4.     Inspectors are to document all in-plant rejections of meat products 
   destined for DND by cause and notify their regional office which, in 
   turn, will notify DPWGS.
