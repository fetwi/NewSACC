<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr>16, the clauses and conditions
identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="2015-07-032029status-of-the-contractor">2029 03 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent Contractor engaged by Canada
to perform the Work. Neither the Contractor nor any of its

The Contractor is responsible for all deductions and remittances
required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2 id="2015-07-032029condition-of-material">2029 04 (2008-05-12) Condition of Material</h2>

<h2 id="2015-07-032029inspection-acceptance-warranty">2029 05 (2014-09-25) Inspection, Acceptance and Warranty</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must perform the Work efficiently in
accordance with standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in
full conformity with all the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance
by Canada. Despite inspection and acceptance of the Work by or on
behalf of Canada and without restricting any provisions of the
Contract or any condition, warranty or provision imposed by law,
the Contractor, if requested by Canada to do so, must replace,
repair or correct, at its own option and expense any work that
becomes defective or fails to conform to the requirements of the
Contract, where applicable. For goods, the warranty period will be
12 months after delivery and acceptance of the Work or the
length of the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty
period, whichever is longer.</li>
<li value="3">Canada must pay the transportation cost associated
with returning the Work or any part of the Work to the Contractor's
plant for replacement, repair or making good, and the Contractor
must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the
replacement or returning the Work or part of the Work when
rectified to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to
another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of
Canada, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location,
the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good
of the Work at that location and will be reimbursed its reasonable
travel and living expenses.</li>
<li value="4">The warranty period is automatically extended by the
duration of any period or periods where the Work is unavailable for
use or cannot be used because of a defect or non-conformance during
the original warranty period. The warranty applies to any part of
the Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to subsection 2,
for the greater of:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the warranty period remaining, including the
extension, or</li>
<li value="2">90 days or such other period as may be
specified for that purpose by agreement between the Parties.</li>

<li value="2">details of expenditures (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as applicable) in accordance with the Basis of Payment, exclusive of Applicable Taxes;</li>
<li value="3">deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li value="5">if applicable, the method of shipment together with
date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
and any other additional charges.</li>

<li value="3">Applicable Taxes must be specified on all invoices as a separate item along with corresponding registration numbers from the tax authorities. All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which Applicable Taxes do not apply, must be identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li value="4">By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2015-07-032029taxes">2029 07 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">
Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes.
</li>
<li value="2">
Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation.

In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award. However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change. 
</li>
<li value="5">Tax Withholding of 15 Percent – Canada Revenue Agency 
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite>Income Tax Regulations</cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite>Canada Revenue Agency</cite>.

<h2 id="2015-07-032029transportation-carrier-liability">2029 09 (2010-01-11) Transportation Carriers' Liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2 id="2015-07-032029shipment-documentation">2029 10 (2008-05-12) Shipment Documentation</h2>
<p>For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading

shipment. In addition, a packing slip must accompany each shipment,

the goods and contract number, including the <abbr title="Client Reference Number">CRN</abbr> and <abbr title="Procurement Business Number">PBN</abbr>. If the

The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31st day following that date and interest
will be paid automatically in accordance with section 12.</li>
<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
15 days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>
