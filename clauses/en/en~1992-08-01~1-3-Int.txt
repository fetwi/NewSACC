<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>General Conditions describe the government's and contractors' rights and 
obligations in various types of contractual situations.  Through the 
addition of clauses and additional statements, specific to an individual 
requirement, they form the foundation upon which contracts are built.

Prior to the introduction of the SACC Manual, General Condition sets were 
attached to bid solicitation packages.  This practice has been replaced by 
incorporation by reference.  The General Conditions specified in standard 
clause K0000D form part of the procurement document.

To improve readability, each set of General Conditions include an index 
section (article) - 00, which details the various subjects covered within 
the condition set.  As well, each section has an effective date.  As 
conditions are updated and modified, only the affected section will receive 
a new effective date, corresponding to the effective date for the whole 
condition set;  thus making changes more readily identifiable by users.

The following list identifies those sets of General Conditions which are 
currently in use by the Department of Supply and Services, their latest 
revision date and their title.
