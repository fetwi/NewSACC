<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks – Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>The purpose of form DSS-MAS 944, Call-Up Against Multiple Standing Offers (a 
french version entitled "Commande subséquente à plusieurs offres à commandes, 
PWGSC-TPSGC 945", is also available) is to allow an identified user to issue a 
single call-up against various standing offers (not to exceed $40,000) to a 
single supplier who is the authorized agent of different offerors, when those 
offerors each hold a valid standing offer with Canada for identified goods.

The following clause should be included in all Requests for a Standing Offer 
where form DSS-MAS 944 is to be used as a call-up document in addition to the 
current PWGSC-TPSGC 942, Call-Up Against a Standing Offer. Should an offeror not 
agree that its agent may represent the holder of a standing offer other than 
itself and that its prices may appear on a multiple call-up form, then the 
clause should not be included in any subsequent Standing Offer and Call-up 
Authority for that offer.

Only one invoice will be issued per call-up. Call-ups issued using form DSS-MAS 
944 are not, under any circumstances, to be issued in order to prevent 
competition.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Offeror agrees and accepts that its agent(s) listed on this 
       Standing Offer may represent the holder of a Standing Offer other 
       than itself. The Offeror further agrees and accepts that its prices, 
       along with those prices offered by those other offerors, will appear 
       on the multiple call-up form, thereby making the prices specified 
       public information.

2.     The Offeror agrees to the disclosure of its prices and further 
       agrees that it shall have no right to claim against Canada, the 
       Minister, the Identified User, their employees, agents or servants, 
       or any of them, in relation to such disclosure.  The Offeror shall 
       also indemnify Canada, the Minister, the Identified User, their 
       employees, agent or servants, and any of them, against any action, 
       suit, demand, right or claim asserted by anyone as a result of such 
       disclosure.

3.     The Offeror is responsible for delivery in the event of default by 
       the agent for those products only that are normally offered by the 
       Offeror.

4.     The Identified User agrees that if the agent defaults on one or more 
       items, the call-up using DSS-MAS 944, Call-Up Against Multiple 
       Standing Offers, cannot be terminated in whole, but only for those 
       portions relating to goods or services specified in the particular 
       Standing Offer to which the default relates and only after the 
       Offeror has been provided with a reasonable opportunity to remedy 
       the default.
