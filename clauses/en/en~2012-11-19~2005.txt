<h2>2005 01 (2007-05-25) Interpretation</h2>

requires,</p>
<p><dfn>"Call-up"</dfn> means an order issued by an Identified User<br/>
duly authorized to issue a call-up against a particular standing<br/>
offer. Issuance of a call-up to the Offeror constitutes acceptance<br/>
of its offer and results in the creation of a contract between Her<br/>
Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Offeror for the goods,<br/>
services or both described in the Call-up;</p>
<p><dfn>"Canada"</dfn>, <dfn>"Crown"</dfn>, <dfn>"Her Majesty"</dfn> or <dfn>"the Government"</dfn><br/>

provide goods, services or both to Canada under the Standing<br/>

any other document specified or referred to as forming part of the<br/>

<p><dfn>"Standing Offer Authority"</dfn> means the person designated<br/>
as such in the Standing Offer, or by notice to the Offeror, to act<br/>
as the representative of Canada in the management of the Standing<br/>
Offer. The Standing Offer Authority will issue a document called<br/>
