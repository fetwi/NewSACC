<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
 Use the following clause when it is beneficial, but not mandatory, for bidders 
to view the site where the work will be performed to improve their understanding 
of the requirement.  In the case of marine requirements, the word "Vessel" may 
be added to the title.

The visit remains optional but there are two options and the contracting officer 
will choose one of the two proposed options.  In the first option, bidders are 
only requested to communicate with the contracting officer to confirm attendance 
but should not be refused access to the site if they have not done so.  In the 
second option, bidders who do not communicate with the contracting officer to 
submit the name(s) of attendee(s) will be refused access to the site (this could 
be for the security reasons for example).  In both cases, bidders will not be 
precluded from submitting a bid if they do not attend or send a representative.
