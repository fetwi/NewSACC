  Clause A3031T is cancelled because it has been replaced by a Mandatory Certification, see Part 5 - Certifications of the Higher Complexity and Medium Complexity Templates and Part 1 of the Low Dollar Value (Simple) Template with a new Annex titled Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity - Certification, to be used for requirements estimated at $1M and above. This certification is mandatory for Departments or Agencies which are subject to the Federal Contractors Program (FCP).

<p>
  Background - In June 2013, a streamlined
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  for employment equity was introduced which changed the obligations of both Contractors and Contracting Authorities in the application of the program.   The threshold for the application of the
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  has been increased to $1M for a bidder, subject to the program, to have an Agreement to Implement Employment Equity (AIEE) in place with
  <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">
   HRSDC
  </abbr>
  -Labour.  Once a bidder is subject to the program, it must honour the
  <abbr title="Agreement to Implement Employment Equity">
   AIEE
  </abbr>
  as an on-going obligation and not simply for the period of the contract.  Contractors who do not comply with the
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  or if their
  <abbr title="Agreement to Implement Employment Equity">
   AIEE
  </abbr>
  becomes invalid will be declared ineligible by
  <abbr title="Human Resources and Skills Development Canada">
   HRSDC
  </abbr>
  -Labour and their names will appear on the "
  <abbr title="Federal Contractors Program">
   FCP
  </abbr>
  Limited Eligibility to Bid" list. In addition, an ineligible contractor should not be awarded future contracts or issued future standing offers,
  <strong>
   regardless of the value
  </strong>
  of the procurement.
