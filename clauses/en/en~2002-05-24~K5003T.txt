<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in which the 
special procedures under the CKTEA are applicable (see Supply Manual), where 
competition is being solely limited to bids offering Canadian and/or Korean 
Goods and Services and where it is mandatory that bidders submit a certification 
with their bid.  This clause is to be used for multi-item requirements that are 
being certified on an individual item basis and where the bidder will be 
required to indicate beside each item, listed in the bid, whether the item is 
Canadian or Korean.

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K5000D, CKTEA Definitions.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is limited to Canadian and/or Korean Goods and 
       Services as defined in clause K5000D, CKTEA Definitions.

2.     By executing this representation and warranty, the Bidder represents 
       and warrants that, of the goods and services being offered, items 
       individually identified as such in the bid are Canadian or Korean 
       Goods and Services as defined in clause K5000D, CKTEA Definitions, 
       and acknowledges that only those items will receive consideration.

3.     Bids may be accepted in whole or in part.

4.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this bid. Such representation and warranty 
       of Canadian and/or Korean content may be verified in such manner as 
       the Minister may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       covenant, the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract 
       resulting from this bid as being in default.

6.     If a Bidder is unable to verify the origin of Goods or Services 
       offered in the bid, then the bid will be considered non-responsive.

7.     Failure to execute this representation and warrantee on the 
       signature block immediately following this paragraph and to include 
       it with the bid will render the bid non-responsive.
