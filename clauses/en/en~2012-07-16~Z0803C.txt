<p class="description">The following replaces paragraphs (c) and (g) of clause
Z0801C.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="3">Title to Government property.
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government shall retain title to all
Government- furnished property.</li>
<li value="2">All Government-furnished property and all property
acquired by the Contractor, title to which vests in the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
Government under this paragraph (collectively referred to as
"Government property"), are subject to the provisions of this
clause. Title to Government property shall not be affected by its
incorporation into or attachment to any property not owned by the
Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture or lose
its identity as personal property by being attached to any real
property.</li>
<li value="3">Title to each item of facilities, special test
equipment, and special tooling (other than that subject to a
special tooling clause) acquired by the Contractor for the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
Government under this Contract shall pass to and vest in the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
Government when its use in performing this Contract commences, or
when the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government has paid for it, whichever is earlier,
whether or not title previously vested in the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government.</li>
<li value="4">Title to equipment (and other tangible personal
property) purchased with funds available for research and having an
acquisition cost of less than $5,000 shall vest in the Contractor
upon acquisition or as soon thereafter as feasible, provided that
the Contractor obtained the Contracting Officer's approval before
each acquisition. Title to equipment purchased with funds available
for research and having an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more shall
vest as set forth in the Contract. If title to equipment vests in
the Contractor under this subparagraph (c)4., the Contractor agrees
that no charge will be made to <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government for any
depreciation, amortization, or use under any existing or future
Contract or subcontract thereunder. The Contractor shall furnish
the Contracting Officer a list of all equipment to which title is
vested in the Contractor under this subparagraph (c)4. within ten
(10) days following the end of the calendar quarter during which it
was received.</li>
<li value="5">Vesting title under this paragraph (c) is subject to
civil rights legislation, 42 <abbr title="United States Code">U.S.C.</abbr> 2000d. Before title is vested
and by signing this Contract, the Contractor accepts and agrees
that:
<blockquote>"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of
race, colour, or national origin, be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to
discrimination under this contemplated financial assistance (title
to equipment)."</blockquote></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="7">Limited risk of loss.
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The term "<dfn>Contractor's managerial personnel</dfn>", as used
in this paragraph (g), means the Contractor's directors, officers,
and any of the Contractor's managers, superintendents, or
equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">all or substantially all of the Contractor's
business;</li>
<li value="2">all or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at
any one plant, laboratory, or separate location at which the
Contract is being performed; or</li>
<li value="3">a separate and complete major industrial operation
connected with performing this Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor shall not be liable for loss or
destruction of, or damage to, the Government property provided
under this Contract (or, if an educational or nonprofit
organization, for expenses incidental to such loss, destruction, or
damage), except as provided in subparagraphs 3. and 4. below.</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor shall be responsible for loss or
destruction of, or damage to, the Government property provided
under this Contract (including expenses incidental to such loss,
destruction, or damage):
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">that results from a risk expressly required to be
insured under this Contract, but only to the extent of the
insurance required to be purchased and maintained, or to the extent
of insurance actually purchased and maintained, whichever is
greater;</li>
<li value="2">that results from a risk which is in fact covered by
insurance or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but
only to the extent of such insurance or reimbursement;</li>
<li value="3">for which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under
the express terms of this Contract;</li>
<li value="4">that results from wilful misconduct or lack of good faith
on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or</li>
<li value="5">that results from a failure on the part of the
Contractor, due to wilful misconduct or lack of good faith on the
part of the Contractor's managerial personnel, to establish and
administer a program or system for the control, use, protection,
preservation, maintenance, and repair of Government property as
required by paragraph (e) of clause Z0801C.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">If the Contractor fails to act as provided in
subdivision (g)3.(v) above, after being notified (by certified mail
addressed to one of the Contractor's managerial personnel) of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>
or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government's disapproval, withdrawal of approval, or
nonacceptance of the system or program, it shall be conclusively
presumed that such failure was due to wilful misconduct or lack of
good faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial
personnel.</li>
<li value="2">Furthermore, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the
Government property shall be presumed to have resulted from such
failure, unless the Contractor can establish by clear and
convincing evidence that such loss, destruction, or damage:
<ol type="A">
<li value="1">did not result from the Contractor's failure to maintain an
approved program or system; or</li>
<li value="2">occurred while an approved program or system was maintained
by the Contractor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">If the Contractor transfers Government property to
the possession and control of a subcontractor, the transfer shall
not affect the liability of the Contractor for loss or destruction
of, or damage to, the property as set forth above. However, the
Contractor shall require the subcontractor to assume the risk of,
and be responsible for, any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
the property while in the subcontractor's possession or control,
except to the extent that the subcontract, with the advance
approval of the Contracting Officer, relieves the subcontractor
from such liability. In the absence of such approval, the
subcontract shall contain appropriate provisions requiring the
return of all Government property in as good condition as when
received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for its use in
accordance with the provisions of the prime Contract.</li>
<li value="6">Upon loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government
property provided under this Contract, the Contractor shall so
notify the Contracting Officer and shall communicate with the loss
and salvage organization, if any, designated by the Contracting
Officer. With the assistance of any such organization, the
Contractor shall take all reasonable action to protect the
Government property from further damage, separate the damaged and
undamaged Government property, put all the affected Government
property in the best possible order, and furnish to the Contracting
Officer a statement of:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the lost, destroyed, or damaged Government
property;</li>
<li value="2">the time and origin of the loss, destruction, or
damage;</li>
<li value="3">all known interests in commingled property of which the
Government property is a part; and</li>
<li value="4">the insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in
such commingled property.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="7">The Contractor shall repair, renovate, and take such
other action with respect to damaged Government property as the
Contracting Officer directs. If the Government property is
destroyed or damaged beyond practical repair, or is damaged and so
commingled or combined with property of others (including the
Contractor's) that separation is impractical, the Contractor may,
with the approval of and subject to any conditions imposed by the
Contracting Officer, sell such property for the account of the
Government. Such sales may be made in order to minimize the loss to
the Government, to permit the resumption of business, or to
accomplish a similar purpose. The Contractor shall be entitled to
an equitable adjustment in the Contract Price for the expenditures
made in performing the obligations under this subparagraph (g)7. in
accordance with paragraph (h) of clause Z0801C. However, the Government may directly
reimburse the loss and salvage organization for any of their
charges. The Contracting Officer shall give due regard to the
Contractor's liability under this paragraph (g) when making any
such equitable adjustment.</li>
<li value="8">The Contractor represents that it is not including in
the price, and agrees it will not hereafter include in any price to
<abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, any charge or reserve for insurance (including any
self-insurance fund or reserve) covering loss or destruction of, or
damage to, Government property, except to the extent that <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may
have expressly required the Contractor to carry such insurance
under another provision of this Contract.</li>
<li value="9">In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or
otherwise compensated for any loss or destruction of, or damage to,
the Government property, the Contractor shall use the proceeds to
repair, renovate, or replace the lost, destroyed, or damaged
Government property or shall otherwise credit the proceeds to or
equitably reimburse <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the Government, as directed by the
Contracting Officer.</li>
<li value="10">The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>'s
or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government's rights to recover against third parties
for any loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property.
Upon the request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall,
at the expense of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government, furnish to that party
all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment
in favour of that party) in obtaining recovery. In addition, where
a subcontractor has not been relieved from liability for any loss
or destruction of, or damage to, Government property, the
Contractor shall enforce for the benefit of the Government the
liability of the subcontractor for such loss, destruction, or
damage.</li>
