       contractor from taking whatever action the contractor considers 
       appropriate in the circumstances.

34.4   The giving of a protest by the contractor pursuant to GC 34.2 shall 
       not relieve the contractor from complying with the decision or

       to the contractor for any extra expense or any loss or damage 
       incurred or sustained by the contractor.

35.2   If the contractor incurs or sustains any extra expense or any loss 
       or damage that is directly attributable to

       35.2.1 a substantial difference between the information relating to 
              soil conditions at the work site that is contained in the 
              Plans and Specifications or other documents supplied to the 
              contractor for use in preparing the contractor's tender or a 
              reasonable assumption of fact based thereon made by the 
              contractor, and the actual soil conditions encountered by the 
              contractor at the work site during the performance of the 
              contract, or

       35.2.2 any neglect or delay that occurs after the date of the 
              contract on the part of Her Majesty in providing any 
              information or in doing any act that the contract either 
              expressly requires Her Majesty to do or that would ordinarily 
              be done by an owner in accordance with the usage of the trade,

       the contractor shall, within ten (10) days of the date the actual 
       soil conditions described in GC 35.2.1 were encountered or the 
       neglect or delay described in GC 35.2.2 occurred, give the Engineer 
       written notice of intention to claim for that extra expense or that 
       loss or damage.

35.4   A written claim referred to in GC 35.3 shall contain a sufficient 
       description of the facts and circumstances of the occurrence that is 
       the subject of the claim to enable the Engineer to determine whether 
       or not the claim is justified and the contractor shall supply such 
       further and other information for that purpose as the Engineer 
       requires from time to time.

35.5   If the Engineer determines that a claim referred to in GC 35.3 is

       the contract, the amount set out in the Articles of Agreement shall, 
       subject to GC 35.7, be reduced by an amount that is equal to the 
       saving.

35.7   The amount of the saving referred to in GC 35.6 shall be determined 
       in accordance with GC 47 to GC 50.

35.8   If the contractor fails to give a notice referred to in GC 35.2 and 
       a claim referred to in GC 35.3 within the times stipulated, an extra 
       payment shall not be made to the contractor in respect of the 
       occurrence.

<strong>GC 36  (01/10/94)    Extension of Time</strong>

36.1   Subject to GC 36.2, the Engineer may, on the application of the 
       contractor made before the day fixed by the Articles of Agreement 
       for completion of the work or before any other date previously fixed 
       under this General Condition, extend the time for its completion by 
       fixing a new date if, in the opinion of the Engineer, causes beyond 
       the control of the contractor have delayed its completion.

36.2   An application referred to in GC 36.1 shall be accompanied by the 
       written consent of the bonding company whose bond forms part of the 
       contract security.

<strong>GC 37  (01/10/94)    Assessments and Damages for Late Completion</strong>

37.1   For the purposes of this General Condition

       37.1.1 the work shall be deemed to be completed on the date that an 
              Interim Certificate of Completion referred to in GC 44.2 is 
              issued, and

       37.1.2 "period of delay" means the number of days commencing on the 
              day fixed by the Articles of Agreement for completion of the 
              work and ending on the day immediately preceding the day on 
              which the work is completed but does not include any day 
              within a period of extension granted pursuant to GC 36.1, and 
              any other day on which, in the opinion of the Engineer, 
              completion of the work was delayed for reasons beyond the 
              control of the contractor.

37.2   If the contractor does not complete the work by the day fixed for 
       its completion by the Articles of Agreement but completes it 
       thereafter, the contractor shall pay Her Majesty an amount equal to 
       the aggregate of

       37.2.1 all salaries, wages and travelling expenses incurred by Her 
              Majesty in respect of persons overseeing the performance of 
              the work during the period of delay;

       37.2.2 the cost incurred by Her Majesty as a result of the inability 
              to use the completed work for the period of delay; and

       37.2.3 all other expenses and damages incurred or sustained by Her 
              Majesty during the period of delay as a result of the work 
              not being completed by the day fixed for its completion.

37.3   The Minister may waive the right of Her Majesty to the whole or any 
       part of the amount payable by the contractor pursuant to GC 37.2 if, 
       in the opinion of the Minister, it is in the public interest to do 
       so.

<strong>GC 38  (01/01/96)    Taking the Work Out of the Contractor's Hands</strong>

38.1   The Minister may, at the Minister's sole discretion, by giving a 
       notice in writing to the contractor in accordance with GC 11, take 
       all or any part of the work out of the contractor's hands, and may 
       employ such means as the Minister sees fit to have the work 
       completed if the contractor

       38.1.1 has not, within six (6) days of the Minister or the Engineer 
              giving notice to the contractor in writing in accordance with 
              GC 11, remedied any delay in the commencement or any default 
              in the diligent performance of the work to the satisfaction 
              of the Engineer;

       38.1.2 has defaulted in the completion of any part of the work 
              within the time fixed for its completion by the contract;

       38.1.3 has become insolvent or has committed an act of bankruptcy, 
              and has neither made a proposal to its creditors nor filed a 
              notice of intention to make such a proposal, pursuant to the 
              Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act; 

       38.1.4 has abandoned the work;

       38.1.5 has made an assignment of the contract without the consent 
              required by GC 3.1; or

       38.1.6 has otherwise failed to observe or perform any of the 
              provisions of the contract.

38.2   If the contractor has become insolvent or has committed an act of 
       bankruptcy, and has either made a proposal to its creditors or filed 
       a notice of intention to make such a proposal, pursuant to the <em>
       Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, the contractor shall immediately 
       forward a copy of the proposal or the notice of intention to Her 
       Majesty.

38.3   If the whole or any part of the work is taken out of the contractor'
       s hands pursuant to GC 38.1,

       38.3.1 the contractor's right to any further payment that is due or 
              accruing due under the contract is, subject only to GC 38.5, 
              extinguished, and

       38.3.2 the contractor is liable to pay Her Majesty, upon demand, an 
              amount that is equal to the amount of all loss and damage 
              incurred or sustained by Her Majesty in respect of the 
              contractor's failure to complete the work.

38.4   If the whole or any part of the work that is taken out of the 
       contractor's hands pursuant to GC 38.1 is completed by Her Majesty, 
       the Engineer shall determine the amount, if any, of the holdback or 
       a progress claim that had accrued and was due prior to the date on 
       which the work was taken out of the contractor's hands and that is 
       not required for the purposes of having the work performed or of 
       compensating Her Majesty for any other loss or damage incurred or 
       sustained by reason of the contractor's default.

38.5   Her Majesty may pay the contractor the amount determined not to be 
       required pursuant to GC 38.4.

<strong>GC 39  (01/10/94)    Effect of Taking the Work Out of the Contractor's 
Hands</strong>

39.1   The taking of the work or any part thereof out of the contractor's 
       hands pursuant to GC 38 does not operate so as to relieve or 
       discharge the contractor from any obligation under the contract or 
       imposed upon him by law except the obligation to complete the 
       performance of that part of the work that was taken out of the 
       contractor's hands.

39.2   If the work or any part thereof is taken out of the contractor's 
       hands pursuant to GC 38, all plant and material and the interest of 
       the contractor in all real property, licences, powers and privileges 
       acquired, used or provided by the contractor under the contract 
       shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty without 
       compensation to the contractor.

39.3   When the Engineer certifies that any plant, material, or any 
       interest of the contractor referred to in GC 39.2 is no longer 
       required for the purposes of the work, or that it is not in the 
       interests of Her Majesty to retain that plant, material, or interest, 
       it shall revert to the contractor.

<strong>GC 40  (01/10/94)    Suspension of Work by Minister</strong>

40.1   The Minister may, when in the Minister's opinion it is in the public 
       interest to do so, require the contractor to suspend performance of 
       the work either for a specified or an unspecified period by giving a 
       notice of suspension in writing to the contractor in accordance with 
       GC 11.

40.2   When a notice referred to in GC 40.1 is received by the contractor 
       in accordance with GC 11, the contractor shall suspend all 
       operations in respect of the work except those that, in the opinion 
       of the Engineer, are necessary for the care and preservation of the 
       work, plant and material.

40.3   The contractor shall not, during a period of suspension, remove any 
       part of the work, plant or material from its site without the 
       consent of the Engineer.

40.4   If a period of suspension is thirty (30) days or less, the 
       contractor shall, upon the expiration of that period, resume the 
       performance of the work and the contractor is entitled to be paid 
       the extra cost, calculated in accordance with GC 48 to GC 50, of any 
       labour, plant and material necessarily incurred by the contractor as 
       a result of the suspension. 
40.5   If, upon the expiration of a period of suspension of more than 
       thirty (30) days, the Minister and the contractor agree that the 
       performance of the work will be continued by the contractor, the 
       contractor shall resume performance of the work subject to any terms 
       and conditions agreed upon by the Minister and the contractor.

40.6   If, upon the expiration of a period of suspension of more than 
       thirty (30) days, the Minister and the contractor do not agree that 
       performance of the work will be continued by the contractor or upon 
       the terms and conditions under which the contractor will continue 
       the work, the notice of suspension shall be deemed to be a notice of 
       termination pursuant to GC 41.

<strong>GC 41  (01/10/94)    Termination of Contract</strong>

41.1   The Minister may terminate the contract at any time by giving a 
       notice of termination in writing to the contractor in accordance 
       with GC 11.

41.2   When a notice referred to in GC 41.1 is received by the contractor 
       in accordance with GC 11, the contractor shall, subject to any 
       conditions stipulated in the notice, forthwith cease all operations 
       in performance of the contract.

41.3   If the contract is terminated pursuant to GC 41.1, Her Majesty shall 
       pay the contractor, subject to GC 41.4, an amount equal to

       41.3.1 the cost to the contractor of all labour, plant and material 
              supplied by the contractor under the contract up to the date 
              of termination in respect of a contract or part thereof for 
              which a Unit Price Arrangement is stipulated in the contract, 
              or

       41.3.2 the lesser of

              41.3.2.1      an amount, calculated in accordance with the 
                            Terms and Payment, that would have been payable 
                            to the contractor had the contractor completed 
                            the work, and

              41.3.2.2      an amount that is determined to be due to the 
                            contractor pursuant to GC 49 in respect of a 
                            contract or part thereof for which a Fixed 
                            Price Arrangement is stipulated in the contract

       less the aggregate of all amount that were paid to the Contractor by 
       Her Majesty and all amounts that are due to Her Majesty from the 
       contractor pursuant to the contract.

41.4   If Her Majesty and the contractor are unable to agree about an 
       amount referred to in GC 41.3 that amount shall be determined by the 
       method referred to in GC 50.

<strong>GC 42  (01/10/94)    Claims Against and Obligations of the Contractor or 
                     Subcontractor</strong>

42.1   Her Majesty may, in order to discharge lawful obligations of and 
       satisfy claims against the contractor or a subcontractor arising out 
       of the performance of the contract, pay any amount that is due and 
       payable to the contractor pursuant to the contract directly to the 
       obligees of and the claimants against the contractor or the 
       subcontractor but such amount if any, as is paid by Her Majesty 
       shall not exceed that amount which the contractor would have been 
       obliged to pay to such claimant had the provisions of the Provincial 
       or Territorial lien legislation, or, in the Province of Quebec, the 
       law relating to privileges, been applicable to the work.  Any such 
       claimant need not comply with the provisions of such legislation 
       setting out the steps by way of notice, registration or otherwise as 
       might have been necessary to preserve or perfect any claim for lien 
       or privilege which claimant might have had.

42.2   Her Majesty will not make any payment as described in GC 42.1 unless 
       and until that claimant shall have delivered to Her Majesty:

       42.2.1 a binding and enforceable Judgment or Order of a court of 
              competent jurisdiction setting forth such amount as would 
              have been payable by the contractor to the claimant pursuant 
              to the provisions of the applicable Provincial or Territorial 
              lien legislation, or, in the Province of Quebec, the law 
              relating to privileges, had such legislation been applicable 
              to the work; or

       42.2.2 a final and enforceable award of an arbitrator setting forth 
              such amount as would have been payable by the contractor to 
              the claimant pursuant to the provisions of the applicable 
              Provincial or Territorial lien legislation, or, in the 
              Province of Quebec, the law relating to privileges, had such 
              legislation been applicable to the work; or

       42.2.3 the consent of the contractor authorizing a payment.

       For the purposes of determining the entitlement of a claimant 
       pursuant to GC 42.2.1 and GC 42.2.2, the notice required by GC 42.8 
       shall be deemed to replace the registration or provision of notice 
       after the performance of work as required by any applicable 
       legislation and no claim shall be deemed to have expired, become 
       void or unenforceable by reason of the claimant not commencing any 
       action within the time prescribed by any applicable legislation.

42.3   The contractor shall, by the execution of this contract, be deemed 
       to have consented to submit to binding arbitration at the request of 
       any claimant those questions that need be answered to establish the 
       entitlement of the claimant to payment pursuant to the provisions of 
       GC 42.1 and such arbitration shall have as parties to it any 
       subcontractor to whom the claimant supplied material, performed work 
       or rented equipment should such subcontractor wish to be adjoined 
       and the Crown shall not be a party to such arbitration and, subject 
       to any agreement between the contractor and the claimant to the 
       contrary, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the 
       Provincial or Territorial legislation governing arbitration 
       applicable in the Province or Territory in which the work is located.

42.4   A payment made pursuant to GC 42.1 is, to the extent of the payment, 
       a discharge of Her Majesty's liability to the contractor under the 
       contract and may be deducted from any amount payable to the 
       contractor under the contract.

42.5   To the extent that the circumstances of the work being performed for 
       Her Majesty permit, the contractor shall comply with all laws in 
       force in the Province or Territory where the work is being performed 
       relating to payment period, mandatory holdbacks, and creation and 
       enforcement of mechanics' liens, builders' liens or similar 
       legislation or in the Province of Quebec, the law relating to 
       privileges.

42.6   The contractor shall discharge all the contractor's lawful 
       obligations and shall satisfy all lawful claims against the 
       contractor arising out of the performance of the work at least as 
       often as the contract requires Her Majesty to pay the contractor.

42.7   The contractor shall, whenever requested to do so by the Engineer, 
       make a statutory declaration deposing to the existence and condition 
       of any obligations and claims referred to in GC 42.6.

42.8   GC 42.1 shall only apply to claims and obligations

       42.8.1 the notification of which has been received by the Engineer 
              in writing before payment is made to the contractor pursuant 
              to TP4.10 and within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the 
              date on which the claimant

              42.8.1.1      should have been paid in full under the 
                            claimant's contract with the contractor or 
                            subcontractor where the claim is for money that 
                            was lawfully required to be held back from the 
                            claimant; or

              42.8.1.2      performed the last of the services, work or 
                            labour, or furnished the last of the material 
                            pursuant to the claimant's contract with the 
                            contractor or subcontractor where the claim is 
                            not for money referred to in GC  42.8.1.1, and

       42.8.2 the proceedings to determine the right to payment of which, 
              pursuant to GC 42.2, shall have commenced within one year 
              from the date that the notice referred to in GC 42.8.1 was 
              received by the Engineer, and

       the notification required by GC 42.8.1 shall set forth the amount 
       claimed to be owing and the person who by contract is primarily 
       liable.

42.9   Her Majesty may, upon receipt of a notice of claim under GC 42.8.1, 
       withhold from any amount that is due and payable to the contractor 
       pursuant to the contract the full amount of the claim or any portion 
       thereof.
 
42.10  The Engineer shall notify the contractor in writing of receipt of 
       any claim referred to in GC 42.8.1 and of the intention of Her 
       Majesty to withhold funds pursuant to GC 42.9 and the contractor may, 
       at any time thereafter and until payment is made to the claimant, be 
       entitled to post, with Her Majesty, security in a form acceptable to 
       Her Majesty in an amount equal to the value of the claim, the notice 
       of which is received by the Engineer and upon receipt of such 
       security Her Majesty shall release to the contractor any funds which 
       would be otherwise payable to the contractor, that were withheld 
       pursuant to the provisions of GC 42.9 in respect of the claim of any 
       claimant for whom the security stands.

<strong>GC 43  (01/10/94)    Security Deposit - Forfeiture or Return</strong>

43.1   If

       43.1.1 the work is taken out of the contractor's hands pursuant to 
              GC 38,

       43.1.2 the contract is terminated pursuant to GC 41, or

       43.1.3 the contractor is in breach of or in default under the 
              contract,

       Her Majesty may convert the security deposit, if any, to Her own use.

43.2   If Her Majesty converts the contract security pursuant to GC 43.1, 
       the amount realized shall be deemed to be an amount due from Her 
       Majesty to the contractor under the contract.

43.3   Any balance of an amount referred to in GC 43.2 that remains after 
       payment of all losses, damage and claims of Her Majesty and others 
       shall be paid by Her Majesty to the contractor if, in the opinion of 
       the Engineer, it is not required for the purposes of the contract.

<strong>GC 44  (01/10/94)    Engineer's Certificates</strong>

44.1   On the date that

       44.1.1 the work has been completed, and

       44.1.2 the contractor has complied with the contract and all orders 
              and directions made pursuant thereto,

       both to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Engineer shall issue a 
       Final Certificate of Completion to the contractor.

44.2   If the Engineer is satisfied that the work is substantially complete 
       the Engineer shall, at any time before issuing a certificate 
       referred to in GC 44.1, issue an Interim Certificate of Completion 
       to the contractor, and

       44.2.1 for the purposes of GC 44.2, the work will be considered to 
              be substantially complete,

              44.2.1.1      when the work under the contract or a 
                            substantial part thereof is, in the opinion of 
                            the Engineer, ready for use by Her Majesty or 
                            is being used for the purposes intended; and

              44.2.1.2      when the work remaining to be done under the 
                            contract is, in the opinion of the Engineer, 
                            capable of completion or correction at a cost 
                            of not more than

                            44.2.1.2.1 - 3% of the first $500,000, and

                            44.2.1.2.2 - 2% of the next $500,000, and

                            44.2.1.2.3 - 1% of the balance

              of the value of the contract at the time this cost is 
calculated.

44.3   For the sole purpose of GC 44.2.1.2, where the work or a substantial 
       part thereof is ready for use or is being used for the purposes 
       intended and the remainder of the work or a part thereof cannot be 
       completed by the time specified in A 2.1, or as amended pursuant to 
       GC 36, for reasons beyond the control of the contractor or where the 
       Engineer and the contractor agree not to complete a part of the work 
       within the specified time, the cost of that part of the work which 
       was either beyond the control of the contractor to complete or the 
       Engineer and the contractor have agreed not to complete by the time 
       specified shall be deducted from the value of the contract referred 
       to GC 44.2.1.2 and the said cost shall not form part of the cost of 
       the work remaining to be done in determining substantial completion.

44.4   An Interim Certificate of Completion referred to in GC 44.2 shall 
       describe the parts of the work not completed to the satisfaction of 
       the Engineer and all things that must be done by the contractor

       44.4.1 before a Final Certificate of Completion referred to in GC 44.1

46.1   For the purposes of GC 47 to GC 50,

       46.1.1 "Unit Price Table" means the table set out in the Articles of 
              Agreement, and

              tradesperson in practicing a trade.

<strong>GC 47  (01/10/94)    Additions or Amendments to Unit Price Table</strong>

47.1   Where a Unit Price Arrangement applies to the contract or a part 
       thereof the Engineer and the contractor may, by an agreement in 
       writing,

       47.1.1 add classes of labour, plant or material, and units of 
              measurement, prices per unit and estimated quantities to the 
              Unit Price Table if any labour, plant or material that is to 
              be included in the Final Certificate of Measurement referred 
              to in GC 44.8 is not included in any class of labour, plant 
              or material set out in the Unit Price Table; or

       47.1.2 subject to GC47.2 and GC 47.3, amend a price per unit set out 
              in the Unit Price Table for any class of labour, plant or 
              material included therein if the Final Certificate of 
              Measurement referred to in GC 44.8 shows or is expected to 
              show that the total quantity of that class of labour, plant 
              or material actually performed, used or supplied by the 
              contractor in performing the work is

              47.1.2.1 less than 85% of that estimated total quantity, or

              47.1.2.2 in excess of 115% of that estimated total quantity.

47.2   In no event shall the total cost of an item set out in the Unit 
       Price Table that has been amended pursuant to GC 47.1.2.1 exceed the 
       amount that would have been payable to the contractor had the 
       estimated total quantity actually been performed, used or supplied.

47.3   An amendment that is made necessary by GC 47.1.2.2 shall apply only 
       to the quantities that are in excess of 115%.

47.4   If the Engineer and the contractor do not agree as contemplated in 
       GC 47.1, the Engineer shall determine the class and the unit of 
       measurement of the labour, plant or material and, subject to GC 47.2 
       and GC 47.3, the price per unit therefor shall be determined in 
       accordance with GC 50.

<strong>GC 48  ( 01/10/94)   Determination of Cost - Unit Price Table</strong>

Whenever, for the purposes of the contract it is necessary to determine the 
cost of labour, plant or material, it shall be determined by multiplying 
the quantity of that labour, plant or material expressed in the unit set 
out in column 3 of the Unit Price Table by the price of that unit set out 
in column 5 of the Unit Price Table.

<strong>GC 49  (12/05/00)    Determination of Cost Prior to Undertaking Work - Lump 
       Sum</strong>

49.1   If the method described in GC 48 cannot be used because the labour, 
       plant and material is of a kind or class that is not set out in the 
       Unit Price Table then, for the purpose of the contract, the price of 
       the change shall be the aggregate costs of all labour, plant and 
       material that is required for the change as agreed upon by the 
       Contractor and the Engineer plus a mark-up for all supervision, 
       coordination, administration, overhead, margin and the risk of 
       undertaking the work within the stipulated amount, which mark-up 
       shall be equal to

       49.1.1        20% of the aggregate costs referred to herein for that 
              portion of the Work done by the Contractor's own forces; and

       49.1.2        15% of the aggregate costs referred to herein for that 
              portion of the Work that is done by subcontract.

49.2   Subject to similar provisions expressed elsewhere in the contract, 
       in order to facilitate approval of the change, the Contractor shall 
       submit a cost breakdown identifying, as a minimum, the cost of 
       labour, plant, material, each subcontract amount and the amount of 
       the appropriate percentage mark-up as described herein.

<strong>GC 50  (12/05/00)    Determination of Cost Following Completion of Work</strong>

50.1   Where it is not possible to predetermine the price of a change, 
       including elements not set out in the Unit Price Table, the actual 
       price of the change shall be equal to the aggregate costs of

       50.1.1        all reasonable and proper amounts actually expended or 
              legally payable by the Contractor in respect of the labour, 
              plant and material that falls within one of the classes of 
              expenditure described in GC 50.2 that are directly 
              attributable to the performance of the contract;
 
       50.1.2        a mark-up equal to 10% of the amounts referred to in 
              GC 50.1.1 which mark-up shall be for profit and all other 
              expenditures or costs, not covered in GC 50.1.1 or GC 50.1.3, 
              including overhead, general administration costs and 
              financing and interest charges; and

       50.1.3        interest on the costs determined under GC 50.1.1 and 
              GC 50.1.2, which interest shall be calculated in accordance 
              with TP9,

       provided that the total cost of an item set out in the Unit Price 
       Table that is subject to the provisions of GC 47.1.2.1 does not 
       exceed the amount that would have been payable to the Contractor had 
       the Estimated Total Quantity of the said item actually been 
       performed, used or supplied.

50.2   For the purpose of GC 50.1.1, the classes of expenditure that may be 
       taken into account in determining the cost of labour, plant and 
       material are

              the plant is owned by the Contractor, that is necessary for 
              and used in the performance of the work, if the rent or the 
              equivalent amount is reasonable and use of that plant has 
              been approved by the Engineer;

       50.2.5 payment for maintenance and operating the plant necessary for 
              and used in the performance of the work, and payments for
