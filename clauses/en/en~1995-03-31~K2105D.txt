(1)    From time to time, in compliance with United Nations obligations or 
       other international agreements, Canada imposes restrictions on trade, 
       financial transactions or other dealings with a foreign country or 
       its nationals.  These sanctions may be implemented by regulation 
       under the <em>United Nations Act</em> (UNA), R.S.C. 1985, c. U-2 , the <em>
       Special Economic Measures Act</em> (SEMA), S.C. 1992, c. 17,  or the <em>
       Export and Import Permits Act</em> (EIPA), R.S.C. 1985, c. E-19.  The 
       Contractor agrees that it will, in the performance of the Contract, 
       comply with any such regulations in effect during the life of the 
       Contract, and will inform its subcontractors of the existence of the 
       SEMA and of its regulations in force at the time of contract award.<strong> </strong>
       In the event of such regulation preventing the Contractor from 
       performing all or part of its obligations, the Contractor shall 
       treat the situation as a force majeure, and forthwith inform Canada 
       of the situation and follow the procedures applicable to force 
       majeure. 

(2)    The Contractor agrees that Canada relies on the Contractor's 
       undertaking in subsection (1) to enter into the Contract, and that 
       any breach of the undertaking shall entitle Canada to terminate the 
       Contract under the provisions of the Contract relating to default by 
       the Contractor, and therefore to recover damages from the Contractor, 
       including reprocurement costs arising out of such a termination.

       countries:
