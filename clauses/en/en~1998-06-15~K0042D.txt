<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause where the deliverables identified in the contractual 
document will be services.
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Contractor warrants that the deliverables resulting from the 
       services provided under this Contract shall meet the contractual 
       requirement so that the deliverables (as evidenced during acceptance 
       tests, as applicable) accurately and automatically process any and 
       all date and date-related data including, but not limited to 
       calculating, comparing, and sequencing of such data from, into and 
       between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including leap 
       year calculations when used in accordance with the documentation 
       provided by the Contractor and accepted by Canada, provided that all 
       hardware, software and firmware products used with the deliverables 
       properly exchange accurate date and date-related data with them.

2.     To that end, the Contractor also warrants that date-related 
       processing will not, in any way, prevent hardware, software or 
       firmware from conforming to the requirement of the Contract prior to, 
       during, or after the year 2000.  Canada may, at no additional cost, 
       require the Contractor, prior to the performance of the services, to 
       demonstrate compliance and/or compliance techniques and test 
       procedures it intends to follow in order to comply with all of the 
       obligations contained herein.

3.     The obligations contained herein apply to the services provided by 
       the Contractor and its subcontractor(s) involved in the performance 
       of this Contract.  Subject to the specific contractual requirement, 
       the obligations contained herein do not apply to hardware, firmware, 
       software or software applications provided as Government Property 
       unless expressed elsewhere in the Contract.

4.     The warranties contained herein are separate and discrete from any 
       other warranties specified in this Contract, and are not subject to 
       any disclaimer of warranty<em> </em>which may be specified in this Contract, 
       its appendices, its schedules, its annexes or any document 
       incorporated in this Contract by reference.  The warranties 
       contained herein are subject to any limitation of the Contractor's 
       liability specified in the Contract.

5.     The warranties contained herein shall not apply where a modification 
       has been made to a deliverable provided under this Contract by a 
       party other than the Contractor or a subcontractor or a party 
       approved in writing by either of them.
 
6.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set out in the 
       applicable Supplemental General Conditions, if any, under the 
       section entitled "Warranty" apply.

7.     The warranties contained herein shall have a term extending either:

       (a)    to June 30, 2000, or,
       (b)    for a period of six months following acceptance of the 
              services,

       whichever is the later date.
