the Services Out of the Consultant's Hands</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may take all or any part of the Services out
of the Consultant's hands and may employ reasonable means necessary
to complete such Services in the event that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Consultant has become insolvent or has committed
an act of bankruptcy, and has neither made a proposal to the
Consultant's creditors nor filed a notice of intention to make such
a proposal, pursuant to the <cite>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="2">the Consultant fails to perform any of the
Consultant's obligations under the Agreement or, in Canada's
opinion, so fails to make progress as to endanger performance of
the Agreement, in accordance with its terms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the Consultant has become insolvent or has
committed an act of bankruptcy, and has either made a proposal to
the Consultant's creditors or filed a notice of intention to make
such a proposal, pursuant to the <cite>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</cite>, the
Consultant must immediately forward a copy of the proposal or the
notice of intention to the Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="3">Before the Services or any part thereof are taken out
of the Consultant's hands under paragraph 1.(b), the Departmental
Representative will provide notice to the Consultant, and may
require such failure of performance or progress to be corrected. If
within fourteen (14) days after receipt of notice the default is
not corrected or corrective action is not initiated to correct such
fault, Canada may, by notice, without limiting any other right or
remedy, take all or any part of the Services out of the
Consultant's hands.</li>
<li value="4">If the Services or any part thereof have been taken
out of the Consultant's hands, the Consultant will be liable for,
and upon demand pay to Canada, an amount equal to all loss and
damage suffered by Canada by reason of the non-completion of the
Services by the Consultant.</li>
<li value="5">If the Consultant fails to pay on demand for the loss
or damage as a result of subsection 4, Canada will be entitled to
deduct and withhold the same from any payments due and payable to
the Consultant.</li>
<li value="6">The taking of the Services, or any part thereof, out
of the Consultant's hands does not relieve or discharge the
Consultant from any obligation under the Agreement, or imposed upon
the Consultant by law, in respect to the Services or any part
thereof that the Consultant has performed.</li>

Suspension</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may, in Canada’s sole and absolute discretion suspend the Services being provided, or any part thereof, for a specified or unspecified period by giving notice of suspension in writing to the Consultant.  The Consultant shall not be entitled to be paid any amount whatsoever for a suspension, other than such amount, if any, payable to the Consultant in accordance with Suspension Costs provisions in GC 5.10.</li>
<li value="2">If a period of suspension does not exceed sixty (60) days and when taken together with other periods of suspension does not exceed ninety (90) days, the Consultant shall, upon the expiration of that period, resume the performance of the Services in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</li>
<li value="3">If a period of suspension exceeds sixty (60) days, or when taken together with other periods of suspension the total exceeds ninety (90) days, Canada and the Consultant may agree that the performance of the Services shall be continued by the Consultant, and the Consultant shall resume performance of the Services, subject only to such terms and conditions agreed upon by Canada and the Consultant in writing.<br/>If Canada and the Consultant do not agree that performance of the Services shall be continued by the Consultant, or upon the terms and conditions under which the Consultant shall continue the Services, the notice of suspension shall be deemed to be a notice of termination in accordance with the terms of GC 7.3.  For clarity, Termination Costs in GC5.11 shall be without duplication of Suspension Costs provisions in GC 5.10. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2018-06-21R1240Dtermination"><span class="clauseRef">R1240D</span> GC7.3 (2018-06-21)
