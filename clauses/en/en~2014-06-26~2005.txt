<h2>2005 01 (2007-05-25) Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the Standing Offer, unless the context otherwise
requires,</p>
<p>"<dfn>Call-up</dfn>" means an order issued by an Identified User
duly authorized to issue a call-up against a particular standing
offer. Issuance of a call-up to the Offeror constitutes acceptance
of its offer and results in the creation of a contract between Her
Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Offeror for the goods,
services or both described in the Call-up;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Canada</dfn>", "<dfn>Crown</dfn>", "<dfn>Her Majesty</dfn>" or "<dfn>the Government</dfn>"
means Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada as represented by
the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and any other
person duly authorized to act on behalf of that Minister.</p>
<p>"<dfn>Identified User</dfn>" means a person or entity identified
in the Standing Offer and authorized by the Standing Offer
Authority to make call-ups against the Standing Offer;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Offeror</dfn>" means the person or entity whose name appears
on the signature page of the Standing Offer and who offers to
provide goods, services or both to Canada under the Standing
Offer;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Standing Offer</dfn>" means the written offer from the
Offeror, the clauses and conditions set out in full text or
incorporated by reference from the <cite>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</cite> Manual, these general conditions, annexes and
any other document specified or referred to as forming part of the
Standing Offer;</p>
<p>"<dfn>Standing Offer Authority</dfn>" means the person designated
as such in the Standing Offer, or by notice to the Offeror, to act
as the representative of Canada in the management of the Standing
Offer. The Standing Offer Authority will issue a document called
"Standing Offer and Call-up Authority" to authorize Identified
Users to make call-ups against the Standing Offer and to notify the
Offeror that authority to make call-ups against the Standing Offer
has been given to Identified Users.</p>
<h2>2005 02 (2006-08-15) General</h2>
<p>The Offeror acknowledges that a standing offer is not a contract
and that the issuance of a Standing Offer and Call-up Authority
does not oblige or commit Canada to procure or contract for any
goods, services or both listed in the Standing Offer. The Offeror
understands and agrees that Canada has the right to procure the
goods, services or both specified in the Standing Offer by means of
any other contract, standing offer or contracting method.</p>
<h2>2005 03 (2007-05-25) Standard Conditions and Clauses</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr>16, the clauses and conditions

written notice to the Standing Offer Authority, unless specified
otherwise in the Standing Offer. The thirty (30) days' period will
start upon receipt of the notification by the Standing Offer
Authority and the withdrawal will be effective at the expiry of
that period. The Offeror must fulfill any and all call-ups which
are made before the expiry of that period.</p>
<h2>2005 07 (2006-08-15) Revision</h2>
<p>The period of the Standing Offer may only be extended, or its
usage increased, by the Standing Offer Authority issuing a revision

<h2>2005 11  (2014-03-01) Integrity Provisions - Standing Offer</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>	The Offeror agrees to comply with the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite> and to be bound by its terms. In addition, the Offeror must also comply with the terms set out in this section.</li>
<li value="2">	The Offeror confirms that it understands that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences may result in setting aside the Standing Offer and terminating for default any resulting contracts. If the Offeror made a false declaration in its offer, makes a false declaration under the Contract, fails to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested, or if the Offeror or any of the Offeror's Affiliates fail to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions during the period of the Standing Offer, such false declaration or failure to comply may result, following a notice period, in the setting aside of the Standing Offer and the termination for default of any resulting contracts. The Offeror understands that a termination for default will not restrict Canada’s right to exercise any other remedies that may be available against the Offeror and agrees to immediately return any advance payments.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Offeror's Affiliates if:   
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be. </li>
<li value="4">	The Offeror who is incorporated or who is a sole proprietorship has already provided a list of names of all individuals who are directors of the Offeror or the name of the owner.  The Offeror who has submitted an offer as a joint venture has already provided a list of names of all directors, or the name of the owner, for each member of the joint venture.  The Offeror must diligently inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list of names of directors during the period of the Standing Offer and the period of any resulting contracts. The Offeror must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms and associated information, and cooperate to the verification process. </li>
<li value="5">	The Offeror certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware, that Canada may verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified in these Integrity Provisions through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="6">	The Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Standing Offer and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
<li value="7"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

In addition, for a conviction under paragraphs a. or b. of subsection 8, following the 10-year period, a pardon or a record suspension must have been obtained, or capacities must have been restored by the Governor in Council.  The Offeror must therefore provide a copy of confirming documentation from an official source for its certification to be found true by Canada for the purpose of these Integrity Provisions.</li>
<li value="8">	The Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror’s Affiliates have been convicted of an offence or received a conditional or an absolute discharge under any of the following provisions, unless the time period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, has elapsed:   

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>), subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>, or</li>

<li value="4">section 45 (<em>Conspiracies, agreements or arrangements between competitors</em>), section 46 (<em>Foreign directives</em>), section 47 (<em>Bid rigging</em>), section 49 (<em>Agreements or arrangements of federal financial institutions</em>), section 52 (<em>False or misleading representation</em>), section 53 (<em>Deceptive notice of winning a prize</em>) of the <cite>Competition Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="5">section 239 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="6">section 327 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Excise Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="7">section 3 (<em>Bribing a foreign public official</em>), section 4 (<em>Accounting</em>), or section 5 (<em>Offence committed outside Canada</em>) of the <cite>Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="8">section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</cite>.</li>
</ol>

The Offeror also certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a. or b. are to receive any benefit under a contract resulting from this Standing Offer, unless a pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, as defined in the Time Period subsection.</li>
<li value="9"><dfn>Foreign Offences</dfn><br/>
The Offeror also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions.  Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to the Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council.</li>
<li value="10"><dfn>Subcontractors</dfn><br/>
The Offeror must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no less favourable to Canada than those imposed in the resulting contract.</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
For governments, as well as entities controlled by a government, including Crown corporations, the present Integrity Provisions are reduced to complying with article 750 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, the <cite>Government Contracts Regulations</cite> and the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2005  12  (2012-07-16) Access to Information</h2>
<p>Records created by the Offeror, and under the control of Canada, are subject to the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>.  The Offeror acknowledges the responsibilities of Canada under the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> and must, to the extent possible, assist Canada in discharging these responsibilities.  Furthermore, the Offeror acknowledges that section 67.1 of the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> provides that any person, who destroys, alters, falsifies or conceals a record, or directs anyone to do so, with the intent of obstructing the right of access that is provided by the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> is guilty of an offence and is liable to imprisonment or a fine, or both.
