<strong>1034   12     Changes in Soil Conditions and Neglect</strong>
<strong>06/91         or Delay by Her Majesty</strong>

(1) No payment will be made by Her Majesty to the Contractor in addition to 
the payment expressly promised by the contract on account of any extra 
expense, loss or damage incurred or sustained by the Contractor for any 
reason including a misunderstanding on the part of the Contractor as to any 
fact, whether or not such misunderstanding is attributable directly or 
indirectly to Her Majesty or any of Her Majesty's agents or servants 
(whether or not any negligence or fraud on the part of Her Majesty's agents 
or servants is involved) unless, in the opinion of the Engineer, the extra 
expense, loss or damage is directly attributable to

       (a) a substantial difference between information relating to soil 
       conditions at the rise of the work, or a reasonable assumption of 
       fact based thereon, in the Plans and Specifications or other 
       documents or material communicated by Her Majesty to the Contractor 
       for his use in preparing his tender and the real soil conditions 
       encountered at the site of the work by the Contractor when executing 
       the work; or

       (b) neglect or delay occurring after the date of the contract on the 
       part of Her Majesty in providing any information or in doing any act 
       which the contract either expressly requires Her Majesty to do or 
       which would be done by an owner, in accordance with the usage of the 
       trade, to enable his Contractor to carry out an undertaking similar 
       to the work being executed under the contract for Her Majesty,

 in which case, if the Contractor has given to the Engineer written notice 
of his claim before the expiration of thirty days from the encountering of 
the soil conditions giving rise to the claim or from the day on which the 
neglect occurs or the delay commences, as the case may be, Her Majesty will 
pay to the Contractor in respect of the additional expense, loss or damage 
incurred or sustained by reason of that difference, neglect or delay, an 
amount equal to the cost, calculated in accordance with sections 44 to 47 
of these General Conditions, of the additional plant, labour and materials 
necessarily involved.

(2) If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the Contractor has effected a 
saving of expenditure by reason of the execution of the work by the 
Contractor being rendered less difficult and less costly because the soil 
conditions actually encountered by the Contractor at the site of the work 
when executing the work are substantially different from soil conditions 
indicated in information or a reasonable assumption of fact based thereon 
in the Plans and Specifications or other documents or material communicated 
by Her Majesty to the Contractor for his use in preparing his tender, the 
amount set out in the contract shall be reduced by an amount equal to the 
saving effected by the Contractor.

(3) Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) and subsection (2) are applicable only 
to a fixed price arrangement.

(4) If information relating to soil conditions at the site of the work 
appeared in the Plans and Specifications or in other documents or material 
communicated by Her Majesty to the Contractor for his use in preparing his 
tender and if the real soil conditions encountered at the site of the work 
by the Contractor when executing the work are substantially different from 
such information, or a reasonable assumption of fact based thereon, so that 
the cost to the Contractor of executing the work is directly and 
substantially increased or decreased by reason of such difference, then the 
Minister and the Contractor may, by agreement, amend the Unit Price Table 
so that the benefit of a substantial decrease in cost shall accrue to Her 
Majesty and the burden of a substantial increase in cost will not be borne 
by the Contractor.

(5) Subsection (4) is applicable only to a Unit Price Arrangement. 

<strong>1034   13     Materials, Plant and Real Property</strong>
<strong>06/91         Become Property of Her Majesty</strong>

(1) All materials and plant and the interest of the Contractor in all real 
property, licences, powers and privileges acquired, used or provided by the 
Contractor for the work shall, from the time of being so acquired, used or 
provided, become and they are the property of Her Majesty for the purposes 
of the work and they shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty

       (a) in the case of materials, until incorporated in the work or 
       until the Engineer indicates that he is satisfied that they will not 
       be required for the work; and

       (b) in the case of plant, real property, licences, powers and 
       privileges, until the Engineer indicates that he is satisfied that 
       the interest vested in Her Majesty therein is no longer required for 
       the purposes of the work.

(2) Material or plant that is the property of Her Majesty by virtue of this 
section shall not be taken away from the site of the work, or used or 
disposed of, except for the purposes of the work, without the consent in 
writing of the Engineer.

(3) Her Majesty is not liable for loss or damage to material or plant that 
is the property of Her Majesty by virtue of this section and the Contractor 
is liable for such loss or damage notwithstanding that the material or 
plant is the property of Her Majesty.  
 
<strong>1034   14     Materials, Plant and Real Property</strong>
<strong>06/91         Supplied by Her Majesty</strong>

(1) The Contractor is liable to Her Majesty for loss or damage to material, 
plant or real property, whether attributable to causes beyond his control 
or not, supplied or made available by Her Majesty to the Contractor for use 
in connection with the work other than loss or damage resulting from and 
directly attributable to reasonable wear and tear.

(2) The Contractor will not use material, plant or real property to which 
this section applies, except for the purpose of carrying out this contract.

(3) When the Contractor has failed, within a reasonable time after being 
required by the Engineer to do so, to make good any loss or damage for 
which he is liable under this section, the Engineer may cause the loss or 
damage to be made good, and the Contractor shall thereupon be liable to her 
Majesty for the cost thereof and shall, on demand, pay to Her Majesty an 
amount equal to such cost.

(4) The Contractor shall keep records of material, plant and real property 
to which this section applies that the Engineer from time to time requires 
and shall, from time to time as the Engineer requires, satisfy the Engineer 
that such material, plant and real property are at the place and in the 
condition that they ought to be.

(5) This section applies to material, plant and real property supplied or 
made available by Her Majesty to the Contractor for use in connection with 
the work. 

<strong>1034   15     Extension of Time</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) The Minister may, on the application of the Contractor made before the 
day fixed by the contract for completion of the work or before any new date 
for completion fixed under this subsection, if in his opinion it is in the 
public interest, extend the time for completion of the work by fixing a new 
day for completion of the work.

(2) Where the Contractor does not complete the work by the day fixed by the 
contract for completion of the work but does complete the work thereafter, 
the Contractor shall pay to Her Majesty

       (a) an amount equal to all salaries, wages and travelling expenses 
       paid by Her Majesty to persons superintending the work during the 
       period of delay;

       (b) an amount equal to the value to Her Majesty of the use of the 
       completed work for the period of delay; and 
       (c) an amount equal to all other expenses and damages incurred or 
       sustained by Her Majesty as a result of the work not being completed 
       during the period of delay.

(3) For the purpose of this section,

       (a) the work shall be deemed to be completed on the day the Engineer 
       issues his Interim Certificate of Completion; and

       (b) "period of delay" means the period commencing on the day fixed 
       by the contract for completion of the work and ending on the day 
       immediately preceding the day on which the work is completed, but 
       excluding therefrom any day within a period of extension granted 
       under subsection (1), if on such day, in the opinion of the Minister, 
       causes beyond the control of the Contractor delayed completion of 
       the work.

(4) The Minister may, if in his opinion it is in the public interest, waive 
the right of Her Majesty to the whole or any part of a payment payable 
pursuant to subsection (2). 

<strong>1034   16     Taking the Work out of the</strong>
<strong>06/91         Contractor's Hands</strong>

(1) In any of the following cases, namely,

       (a) where the Contractor has made default or delayed in commencing 
       or in diligently executing the work or any portion thereof to the 
       satisfaction of the Engineer and the Minister or the Engineer has 
       given notice thereof to the Contractor and has by such notice 
       required the Contractor to put an end to such default or delay, and 
       such default or delay continues for six days after such notice was 
       communicated;

       (b) where the Contractor has made default in the completion of the 
       work, or any portion thereof, within the time limited for such 
       completion by the contract;

       (c) where the Contractor has become insolvent;

       (d) where the Contractor has committed an act of bankruptcy;

       (e) where the Contractor has abandoned the work;

       (f) where the Contractor has made an assignment of the contract 
       without the required consent; or

       (g) where the Contractor has otherwise failed to observe or perform 
       any of the provisions of the contract; 

the Minister may, without any other authorization, take all or any part of 
the work out of the Contractor's hands and may employ such means as he may 
see fit to complete the work. 
(2) Where the work or any portion thereof has been taken out of the 
Contractor's hands under subsection (1), the Contractor shall not, except 
as provided in subsection (3), be entitled to any further payment, 
including payments then due and payable but not paid, and the obligation of 
Her Majesty to make payments as provided for in the contract shall be at an 
end and the Contractor shall be liable to and upon demand therefor pay to 
Her Majesty an amount equal to all loss and damage suffered by Her Majesty 
by reason of the non-completion of the work by the Contractor.

(3) Where the work or any portion thereof has been taken out of the 
Contractor's hands under subsection (1) and that portion is subsequently 
completed by Her Majesty, the Engineer shall determine the amount, if any, 
of holdback and progress claims of the Contractor unpaid at the time of 
taking the work out of his hands that in his opinion are not required by 
Her Majesty for the purposes of the contract and the Minister shall, if he 
is of opinion that no financial prejudice to Her Majesty will result, 
authorize payment of that amount to the Contractor. 

<strong>1034   17     Effect of Taking the Work from</strong>
<strong>06/91         Contractor</strong>

(1) The taking of the work, or any portion thereof, out of the Contractor's 
hands pursuant to section 16 of the General Conditions does not operate so 
as to relieve or discharge the Contractor from any obligation under the 
contract or imposed upon him by law except the obligation to complete the 
physical execution of that portion of the work so taken out of his hands.

(2) If the work or any part thereof is taken out of the Contractor's hands 
pursuant to section 16, all materials and plant and the interest of the 
Contractor in all real property, licences, powers and privileges acquired, 
used or provided by the Contractor for the purposes of the work shall, 
notwithstanding subsection (1) of section 13 of these General Conditions, 
be the property of Her Majesty without compensation to the Contractor.

(3) If the Engineer certifies that any interest in the property of Her 
Majesty by virtue of subsection (2) is no longer required for the purposes 
of the work and that it is not in the interests of Her Majesty to retain 
the interest, it shall become the property of the Contractor. 

<strong>1034   18     Suspension of Work by the Minister</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) The Minister may, when in his opinion it is in the public interest, 
require the Contractor to suspend execution of the work, either for a 
specified or unspecified period, by communicating notice to that effect to 
the Contractor.
 
(2) The Contractor, upon receiving notice of the Minister's requirement 
pursuant to subsection (1), shall suspend all operations except those which, 
in the Engineer's opinion, are necessary for the care and preservation of 
the work, the materials and plant.

(3) During the period of suspension, the Contractor shall not remove from 
the site any part of the work, any materials or any plant without the 
consent of the Engineer.

(4) If the period of suspension is 30 days or less, the Contractor, upon 
expiration of the period of suspension, shall resume the execution of the 
work and he is entitled to be paid the cost, calculated in accordance with 
sections 44 to 47 of the General Conditions, of any plant, labour and 
material necessarily involved in complying with the suspension.

(5) If the period of suspension is more than 30 days and if, upon the 
expiration of the period of suspension, the Minister and the Contractor 
agree that the execution of the work be completed by the Contractor, the 
Contractor shall resume operations and complete the execution of the work 
in accordance with any terms and conditions agreed upon by the Minister and 
the Contractor.

(6) If, upon the expiration of a period of suspension of more than 30 days, 
the Minister and the Contractor do not agree that the work will be 
completed by the Contractor or they are unable to agree upon the terms and 
conditions under which the Contractor will complete the work, the notice of 
suspension shall be deemed to be a notice of termination pursuant to 
section 19.

       all labour, material and plant supplied by the Contractor as at the 
       date of termination or, if the Contractor and the Minister cannot 
       agree, as calculated in accordance with the formula set out in 
       section 46 of the General Conditions, less all amounts already paid 
       to the Contractor by Her Majesty and less all amounts which the 
       Contractor is liable to pay to Her Majesty; and
 
       (b) the amount calculated in accordance with the terms of payment 
       which would have been payable to the Contractor had he completed the 
       work.

(4) If the contract is terminated pursuant to subsection (1), Her Majesty 
will pay to the Contractor an amount equal to the cost, as agreed upon by 
the Contractor and the Minister, of all labour, material and plant supplied 
by the Contractor as of the date of termination or, if the Contractor and 
the Minister cannot agree, as calculated in accordance with the formula set 
out in section 46 of the General Conditions, less all amounts already paid 
to the Contractor by Her Majesty and less all amounts which the Contractor 
is liable to pay to Her Majesty.

(5) Subsection (3) is applicable only to a fixed price arrangement and 
subsection (4) is applicable only to a unit price arrangement.

work, except things in respect of which the contract expressly provides 
otherwise and except the site of the work if the work when completed is to 
remain permanently affixed thereon.  

<strong>1034   21     Claims Against and Obligations of the</strong>
<strong>06/91         Contractor or Subcontractor</strong>

(1) Her Majesty may, in order to discharge lawful obligations of and 
satisfy lawful claims against the Contractor or a subcontractor arising out 
of the execution of the work, pay any amount which is due and payable to 
the Contractor pursuant to the contract or is payable pursuant to section 
41 of the General Conditions following a conversion or a negotiation of the 
security deposit directly to the obligees of and the claimant against the 
Contractor or the subcontractor.  

(2) A payment made pursuant to subsection (1) is, to the extent of the 
payment, a discharge of Her Majesty's liability under the contract to the 
Contractor.  

(3) To the extent that the circumstance of the work being executed for Her 
Majesty permits it, the Contractor will comply with all laws in force in 
the Province where the work is being executed relating to payment periods, 
mandatory holdbacks, and creation and enforcement of mechanics' liens or, 
if such Province is the Province of Quebec, the law relating to privileges.  

(4) The Contractor will discharge all lawful obligations of his and will

work, at least as often as the contract requires Her Majesty to discharge 
Her obligations to the Contractor.

<strong>1034   50     Progress Report and Payment thereunder</strong>
<strong>06/91         not Binding on Her Majesty</strong>

Neither a Progress Report nor a payment by Her Majesty pursuant to the 
contract shall be construed as evidence that the work, material or any part 
thereof is complete, is satisfactory or is in accordance with the contract.  

<strong>1034   51     Delay in Making Payment</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

Delay by Her Majesty in making payment when it becomes due and is payable 
pursuant to the contract shall be deemed not to be a breach of the contract 
by Her Majesty but such delay shall, if the payment involved is payable 
pursuant to subsection (4) of section 49 of the General Conditions and if 
the delay continues for more than 15 days, entitle the Contractor to 
interest on the amount overdue and Her Majesty will, when making payment of 
the amount overdue, pay to the Contractor interest on the amount overdue, 
calculated for the period of the said delay at 1-1/2% plus the average 
accepted tender rate of Government of Canada three-month treasury bills, as 
announced each week by the Bank of Canada on behalf of the Minister of 
Finance, which rate shall be that which is announced immediately preceding 
the date on which payment was originally due to the Contractor.  

<strong>1034   52     Right of Set-off</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) Without restricting any right of set-off given or implied by law, Her 
Majesty may set-off against any amount payable to the Contractor under the 
contract, any amount payable to Her Majesty by the Contractor under this 
contract or under any current contract and without restricting the 
generality of the foregoing Her Majesty may, when making payment pursuant 
to section 49 of these General Conditions, deduct from the amount payable 
any amount which is then payable to Her Majesty by the Contractor under the 
contract or which, by virtue of the right of set-off, may be retained by 
Her Majesty.  

(2) For the purposes of this section "current contract" means:  

       (a) a contract between Her Majesty and the Contractor under which 
       the Contractor has an undischarged obligation to perform or supply 
       work, labour or materials; or  

       (b) a contract between Her Majesty and the Contractor in respect of 
       which Her Majesty has, since the date of this contract, exercised 
       the right to take the work, the subject of that contract, out of the 
       Contractor's hands.  



                         CONSTRUCTION INSURANCE SCHEDULE   
This is the Insurance referred to in section 31 of these General Conditions 

(1) The Contractor shall effect and maintain Fire Insurance including 
supplemental perils during construction on all buildings and structures 
included in the work and on all materials, plant or real property at the 
site of the work, whether or not such materials, plant or real property 
shall have been supplied or made available to the Contractor by Her Majesty, 
in an amount at least equal to the amount of the contract price, less cost 
of excavation and of brick, stone or concrete foundations, piers or other 
supports which are below the under-surface of the lowest basement floor or, 
where there is no basement, which are below the surface of the ground. 
Unless otherwise instructed by the Minister, the Contractor shall keep such 
insurance in force until the issuance of the Engineer's Final Certificate 
of Completion.  

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Contractor shall not, 
unless otherwise instructed by the Minister, effect Fire Insurance 
including supplemental perils on Crown-owned buildings and structures which 
pursuant to this contract are being repaired, added to, improved, 
maintained or rehabilitated, but the Contractor may at his option and for 
his own protection insure the work being performed in connection with such 
Crown buildings and structures against loss or damage by fire.   

(3) The Contractor shall effect and maintain Boiler and Machinery Insurance 
for direct damage only, which insurance is to include provision for 
inspection service; provided however that such Boiler and Machinery 
Insurance shall not, unless otherwise instructed by the Minister, be 
effected in respect of Crown-owned buildings and structures which pursuant 
to this contract are being repaired, added to, improved, maintained or 
rehabilitated. 

(4) Liability Insurance in the minimum amounts set out below shall be 
effected unless otherwise instructed by the Minister. If the Minister 
directs an increase or decrease in such limits, the contract price shall be 
adjusted accordingly. Each policy shall provide that, if Her Majesty 
sustains loss from a risk insured against in circumstances which give Her 
Majesty a cause of action against the Contractor, the policy shall protect 
Her Majesty in the same manner as it would any other claimant:  

       (a) General Public Liability to third parties, up to $100,000 for 
       death or injury to any one person arising from one accident and $200,000 
       for death or injury to more than one person arising from any one 
       accident and Property Damage up to $100,000 for damage to property 
       arising from any one accident.  

       (b) Automobile and other vehicular coverage for Public Liability up 
       to $100,000 for death or injury to any one person arising from one 
       accident and $200,000 for death or injury to more than one person 
       arising from one accident and Property Damage up to $25,000 for any 
       one accident.  

       (c) Workmen's Compensation Insurance or Employer's Liability 
       Insurance in accordance with the legal requirements of the province 
       or territory where the work is being carried out.  

(5) The policies covering the above-mentioned insurance shall be issued in 
the joint names of the Contractor and Her Majesty the Queen in right of 
Canada as their respective interests may appear and, as provided by 
subsection 2 of section 31 of these General Conditions, all fire insurance 
policies shall provide that the proceeds thereof are payable to Her Majesty.
