<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     In this clause,

       "Maximum Contract Value" means the amount specified in the 
       Limitation of Expenditure clause set out in the Contract; and

       "Minimum Contract Value" means ______ of the Maximum Contract Value.

2.     The Contractor must perform the Work described in the Contract as 
       and when requested by Canada during the period of the Contract.  
       Canada's obligation under the Contract is to request Work in the 
       amount of the Minimum Contract Value or, at Canada's option, to pay 
       the Contractor at the end of the Contract in accordance with 
       paragraph 3.  In consideration of such obligation, the Contractor 
       agrees to stand in readiness throughout the Contract period to 
       perform the Work described in the Contract.  Canada's maximum 
       liability for work performed under the Contract must not exceed the 
       Maximum Contract Value, unless an increase is authorized in writing 
       by the Contracting Authority.

3.     In the event that Canada does not request work in the amount of the 
       Minimum Contract Value during the period of the Contract, Canada 
       must pay the Contractor the difference between the Minimum Contract 
       Value and the cost of the Work requested.

4.     Canada will have no obligation to the Contractor under this clause 
       if Canada terminates the Contract in whole or in part for default.
