1.     In these Dispute Resolution Conditions and in clause R0208D, Dispute 
       Resolution - Rules for Mediation, 

       "dispute" means any disagreement regarding any issue identified by 
       the Contractor in the notice submitted to the Departmental 
       Representative in accordance with section GC 8.3, and includes any 
       claim by the Contractor arising from such disagreement and any 
       counterclaim by Canada, but does not include any claim by either 
       party for punitive or exemplary damages, injury to persons, death, 
       or any claim based on an allegation of libel or slander; and

       "Working Day" means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday 
       which is observed by the construction industry in the area where the 
       Work is located.

2.     The alternative dispute resolution procedures set out in GC 8, do 
       not apply to any claim by Canada against the Contractor except any 
       counterclaim in a dispute, including, but not limited to, any claim 
       of setoff regarding any amount due to Canada under section GC 6.3.

<strong>GC 8.2 Consultation</strong> <strong>and Co-operation</strong><strong></strong>

1.     The parties agree to maintain open and honest communication 
       throughout the performance of the Contract.

2.     The parties agree to consult and co-operate with each other in the 
       furtherance of the Work and the resolution of problems or 
       differences which may arise.

<strong>GC 8.3 Authority of Departmental Representative</strong>

1.     Any differences between the parties to the Contract of any nature 
       arising out of, or in connection with, the Contract which could 
       result in a claim by the Contractor against Canada, and which is not 
       settled by consultation and co-operation as envisaged in section GC 
       8.2, shall be resolved in the first instance by the Departmental 
       Representative, whose written decision or direction shall be final 
       and binding subject only to the provisions of GC 8.  Such written 
       decision or direction includes, but is not limited to, any written 
       decision or direction by the Departmental Representative under any 
       provision of the General Conditions.

2.     The Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted the decision or 
       direction of the Departmental Representative referred to in 
       subsection GC 8.3.1 and to have expressly waived and released Canada 
       from any claim in respect of the particular matter dealt with in 
       that decision or direction unless, within fifteen (15) working days 
       after receipt of the decision or direction, the Contractor submits 
       to the Departmental Representative a written notice of dispute 
       requesting formal negotiation under GC 8.4.  Such notice shall refer 
       specifically to section GC 8.4, and shall specify the issues in 
       contention and the relevant provisions of the Contract.

3.     The giving of a written notice in accordance with subsection GC 8.3.2 
       shall not relieve the Contractor from complying with the decision or 
       direction that is the subject of the dispute.  Such compliance, 
       however, shall not be construed as an admission by the Contractor of 
       the correctness of such decision or direction.

4.     If a dispute is not resolved promptly, the Departmental 
       Representative shall give such instructions as, in the Departmental 
       Representative's opinion, are necessary for the proper performance 
       of the Work and to prevent delays pending a resolution of the matter.  
       Unless the Minister terminates the Contract, orders the Contractor 
       to suspend the Work, or takes the Work out of the hands of the 
       Contractor, the Contractor shall continue to perform the Work in 
       accordance with the provisions and requirements of the Contract and 
       the instructions of the Departmental Representative.  Such 
       performance shall not prejudice any claim that the Contractor may 
       have.

5.     Nothing in GC 8 relieves the Contractor from its obligation to 
       provide any other notice required by the Contract within the time 
       specified in the Contract, including, but not limited to, any notice 
       required under section GC 6.2.

<strong>GC 8.4 Negotiation</strong> 
1.     Within ten (10) working days after receipt by the Departmental 
       Representative of a notice referred to in subsection GC 8.3.2, or 
       within such other period of time as may be mutually agreed to, the 
       parties shall commence formal negotiations in order to resolve the 
       dispute.  Negotiations shall occur initially between representatives 
       of the Contractor and Canada who play a direct supervisory role in 
       the performance, administration or management of the Contract.

2.     If the representatives referred to in subsection GC 8.4.1 are unable 
       to resolve some or all of the issues which are the subject of the 
       negotiations within ten (10) working days, the parties shall refer 
       the remaining issues which are in dispute to a second level of 
       negotiation between a principal or principals of the Contractor and 
       a senior level manager or senior level managers representing Canada.

3.     If negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) 
       working days from the date of delivery of the notice referred to in 
       subsection GC 8.3.2, or within such longer period as may have been 
       agreed to by the parties, the Contractor may, by giving written 
       notice to the Departmental Representative, in accordance with 
       section GC 2.5, within ten (10) working days from the end of such 
       period, request that mediation be undertaken to assist the parties 
       to reach agreement on the outstanding issues.

4.     If the Contractor does not request mediation within the period 
       permitted by subsection GC 8.4.3, the Contractor shall be deemed to 
       have accepted the decision or direction of the Departmental 
       Representative under subsection 1 of GC 8.3, and to have expressly 
       waived and released Canada from any claim in respect of the 
       particular matter dealt with in that decision or direction.

<strong>GC 8.5 Mediation</strong>

1.     If the Contractor has requested mediation in accordance with 
       subsection GC 8.4.3, mediation shall be conducted in accordance with 
       clause R0208D, Dispute Resolution - Rules for Mediation.

2.     If a Project Mediator has not previously been appointed for the 
       purposes of the Contract, a Project Mediator shall be appointed in 
       accordance with R0208D, forthwith after delivery of a notice in 
       accordance with subsection GC 8.4.3, requesting mediation.

3.     If the dispute has not been resolved within

       (a)    ten (10) working days following the appointment of a Project 
              Mediator in accordance with subsection GC 8.5.2 if a Project 
              Mediator was not previously appointed;

       (b)    ten (10) working days following receipt by the Departmental 
              Representative of a written notice in accordance with 
              subsection GC 8.4.4, if a Project Mediator was previously 
              appointed; or

       (c)    such other longer period as may have been agreed to by the 
              parties;

       the Project Mediator shall terminate the mediation by giving written 
       notice to the parties stating the effective date of termination.

<strong>GC 8.6 Confidentiality</strong>

All information exchanged during alternative dispute resolution procedures, 
by whatever means, shall be without prejudice and shall be treated as 
confidential by the parties and their representatives, unless otherwise 
required by law.  However, evidence that is independently admissible or 
discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable by 
virtue of its use during an alternative dispute resolution process.

<strong>GC 8.7 Settlement</strong>

Any agreement to settle all or any part of a dispute, by whatever means, 
shall be in writing and be signed by the parties or their authorized 
representatives.
