<h2 id="2014-09-252007general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated
expenditure specified in a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) are
only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing
offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A
standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a
Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to
departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not
constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods,
services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or
several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2 id="2014-09-252007integrity-provisions">01 (2014-09-25) Integrity Provisions - Offer </h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>	Offerors must comply with the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>. In addition, offerors must respond to Requests for Standing Offers (RFSO) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>, Standing Offer (SO) and any resulting contracts, and submit offers as well as enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">	By submitting an offer, offerors confirm that they understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be issued a Standing Offer and awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications is found by Canada to be untrue in any respect, at the time of issuance of the Standing Offer (SO). If it is determined, after issuance of the <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr>, that the Offeror made a false declaration, Canada will, following a notice period, have the right to set aside the <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> and to terminate for default any resulting contracts. The Offeror will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested. The Offeror and any of the Offeror's Affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions during the period of any <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any resulting call-ups.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals and directors, are Offeror's Affiliates if: 
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">	a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.</li>
<li value="4">	Offerors who are incorporated, including those submitting offers as a joint venture, must provide a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Offeror. Offerors submitting offers as sole proprietorship, including those submitting offers as a joint venture, must provide the name of the owner. Offerors submitting offers as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.<br/>

If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of offers is completed, Canada will inform the Offeror of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to provide the names within the time frame specified will render the offer non-responsive. Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for a Standing Offer to be issued.<br/>

Canada may, at any time, request that the Offeror provide properly completed and signed consent forms (Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229) for any or all individuals mentioned above within a specified time frame. Failure to provide such consent forms and associated information within the time frame provided, or failure to cooperate to the verification process, will result in the offer being declared non-responsive.</li>
<li value="5">	The Offeror must diligently inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list of names of directors during this procurement process as well as during the period of any Standing Offer arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> and any resulting call-ups. The Offeror must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms. </li>
<li value="6">	By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility. Canada may also verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="7">	By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Standing Offer and any resulting call-ups if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
<li value="8"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

In addition, for a conviction under paragraphs a. or b. of subsection 9, following the 10-year period, a pardon or a record suspension must have been obtained, or capacities must have been restored by the Governor in Council. The Offeror must therefore provide with its offer or promptly afterwards a copy of confirming documentation from an official source for its certification to be found true by Canada for the purpose of these Integrity Provisions. If the documentation has not been received by the time the evaluation of offers is completed, Canada will inform the Offeror of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to comply within the time frame specified will render the offer non-responsive.</li>
<li value="9">	By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror’s Affiliates have been convicted of an offence or received a conditional or an absolute discharge under any of the following provisions, unless the time period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, has elapsed: 

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>), subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="2">section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor subscribing to election fund</em>), section 124 (<em>Selling or Purchasing Office</em>), section 380 (<em>Fraud</em>) for fraud committed against Her Majesty or section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="3">section 119 (<em>Bribery of judicial officers, etc</em>), section 120 (<em>Bribery of officers</em>), section 346 (<em>Extortion</em>), sections 366 to 368 (<em>Forgery and other offences resembling forgery</em>), section 382 (<em>Fraudulent manipulation of stock exchange transactions</em>), section 382.1 (<em>Prohibited insider trading</em>), section 397 (<em>Falsification of books and documents</em>), section 422 (<em>Criminal breach of contract</em>), section 426 (<em>Secret commissions</em>), section 462.31 (<em>Laundering proceeds of crime</em>) or sections 467.11 to 467.13 (<em>Participation in activities of criminal organization</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="4">section 45 (<em>Conspiracies, agreements or arrangements between competitors</em>), section 46 (<em>Foreign directives</em>), section 47 (<em>Bid rigging</em>), section 49 (<em>Agreements or arrangements of federal financial institutions</em>), section 52 (<em>False or misleading representation</em>), section 53 (<em>Deceptive notice of winning a prize</em>) of the <cite>Competition Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="5">section 239 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="6">section 327 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Excise Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="7">section 3 (<em>Bribing a foreign public official</em>), section 4 (<em>Accounting</em>), or section 5 (<em>Offence committed outside Canada</em>) of the <cite>Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="8">section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</cite>.</li>
</ol>

The Offeror also certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a. or b. are to receive any benefit under a Standing Offer arising from this Request for Standing Offers and any resulting call-ups, unless a pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, as defined in the Time Period subsection.</li>
<li value="10"><dfn>Foreign Offences</dfn><br/>
The Offeror also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror’s Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions. Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to the Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council. 
</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Subcontractors</dfn><br/>
The Offeror must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no less favourable to Canada than those imposed in the resulting contract.</li>
<li value="12"><dfn>Preventive Measures associated with the Time Period</dfn><br/>
In cases where the period (as defined in the Time Period subsection), for a conviction, or a conditional or an absolute discharge of the Offeror or any of the Offeror’s Affiliates has elapsed, then the Offeror must also certify for itself and for its Affiliates that measures have been diligently put in place in order to avoid the reoccurrence of such convictions or reprehensible actions. </li>
<li value="13"><dfn>Public Interest Exception</dfn><br/>
Offerors understand that Canada may issue a Standing Offer with an offeror where the Offeror or the Offeror’s Affiliateshave been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge for an offence specified in these Integrity Provisions, when required to do so by law or legal proceedings, or when Canada in its sole discretion considers it necessary to the public interest for reasons which include, but are not limited to: 
<ul>
<li>no one else is capable of performing the contract;</li>
<li>emergency;</li>
<li>national security;</li>
<li>health and safety;</li>
<li>economic harm;</li>
</ul>

If all offers are found non-responsive for reason of a listed relevant conviction or act, then Canada may invoke the public interest exception, as described in the paragraph above. In such cases, only offers containing a declaration concerning a relevant offence or act will be further considered. Canada may also elect to procure outside of the present process. In all cases, Canada reserves the right to impose additional conditions or measures to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.</li>
<li value="14"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
For governments, as well as entities controlled by a government, including Crown corporations, the present Integrity Provisions are reduced to complying with article 750 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, the <cite>Government Contracts Regulations</cite> and the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>.</li>
