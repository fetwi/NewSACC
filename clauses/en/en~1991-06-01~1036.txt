       (a)  "the General Conditions" means General Conditions DSS-MAS 1026 
       forming part of the contract;

       (b)  "Work" includes engineering investigations, tests, designs, 
       technical reports, drawings, plans, specifications, models, 
       prototypes, patterns, and samples procured, made or prepared for the 
       purposes of the contract;

       (c)  "Project Officer" means the person or persons (if any) 
       designated as such in the agreement and/or any person or persons for 
       the time being authorized to act on behalf of Her Majesty or the 
       Minister as the Project Officer under the contract.  

(2) These supplemental conditions shall be read with the General Conditions 
provided that, in the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions 
of the General Conditions and of these supplemental conditions, the latter 
shall prevail. 



<strong>1036   02     (06/91)       Conduct of the Work</strong>


The Contractor shall carry out the work to the satisfaction of the Project 
Officer and shall comply with all instructions and directions which may, 
from time to time, be given by the Minister or the Project Officer with 
respect to the work or the conduct or progress thereof.  

<strong>1036   03     (06/91)       Ownership of Designs, Reports, Property, Etc.</strong>
              

All designs, technical reports, photographs, drawings, plans, 
specifications, models, prototypes, patterns, and samples produced by the 
Contractor in the performance of the work shall vest in and remain the 
property of Her Majesty. All other property produced or acquired by the 
Contractor in any manner in connection with the work and the cost of which 
is paid by Her Majesty shall vest in and remain the property of Her Majesty. 
The Contractor shall account fully to the Minister in respect of the 
foregoing in such manner as the Minister shall direct.  
 
<strong>1036   04     (06/91)       Ownership of Inventions</strong>


Unless otherwise provided in the contract, all technical information, 
inventions, methods and processes conceived or developed or first actually 
reduced to practice in carrying out the contract shall be the property of 
Her Majesty and shall be fully and promptly disclosed in writing to Her 
Majesty by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall have no rights in and to 
the same, except such rights therein as may be granted by Her Majesty, and 
shall not apply for any patent in regard thereto without Her Majesty's 
written consent.  The Contractor shall not, without the written consent of 
Her Majesty, divulge or use such technical information, inventions, methods, 
and processes other than in the carrying out of the work and, in particular,

license to manufacture such articles or things without the written consent 
of Her Majesty.  

<strong>1036   05     (06/91)       Officers, Employees, Agents, and Subcontractors</strong>
              

The Contractor shall take every reasonable measure and precaution to ensure 
that its officers, employees, agents, and subcontractors shall be bound to 
observe the provisions of these Supplemental General Conditions.  Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the contractors shall include in 
any subcontract hereunder clauses similar to these Supplemental General 
Conditions in terms not less favourable to Her Majesty than the terms of

to pay or proposes to pay for or in respect of the carrying out of the 
contract, and the basis thereof, and the parties to whom the same are 
payable, and shall, from time to time, promptly advise the Minister of any 
and all claims or arrangements made or proposed which would or might result 
in further or different payments by way of royalties being made by the 
Contractor or any of its subcontractors. 

(2) The Contractor shall not pay, and shall direct its subcontractors not 
to pay, any royalties in respect of the carrying out of the contract except 
with the consent in writing of the Minister and subject to such conditions 
as the Minister may impose.   
(3) Subject to compliance by the Contractor with the foregoing provisions, 
Her Majesty shall relieve and indemnify the Contractor from and against all 
claims, actions, or proceedings for payment of such royalties in cases 
where the Minister withholds such consent.
