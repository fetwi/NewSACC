<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all firm-price contracts with Canadian-based 
contractors providing for payment on delivery only, if the contract provides for 
exchange rate fluctuations. 
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.  The price(s) in Canadian funds include(s) foreign currency component(s) 
in respect of goods and/or services originating outside Canada as detailed 
in form DSS-MAS 9411, Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments, which forms part 
of this Contract.

2.  The price shall be adjusted upwards or downwards to reflect the actual 
costs incurred with respect to the fluctuations in the exchange rate and 
their effect on the foreign currency component of the price.

3.  The foreign currency component is defined as the element of the price 
which will be affected by the exchange rate fluctuations and it includes 
the duty-paid value (value in Canadian funds of the foreign component 
including customs duty) plus goods and services and excise taxes of an ad 
valorem nature on the imported item(s), as well as transportation costs 
payable in foreign currency.

4.  The foreign currency component(s) subject to adjustment in respect of 
goods and services purchased outside of Canada with payment in a foreign 
currency, or from authorized Canadian agents but paid for in a foreign 
currency, and the applicable conversion factor(s) are as detailed in form 
DSS-MAS 9411 which forms part of this Contract.

5.  Price adjustments with respect to foreign currency fluctuations will be 
based upon the value of the foreign currency component in foreign funds 
(see section A, form DSS-MAS 9411) with appropriate adjustments to reflect 
the actual rate obtained as opposed to the rate specified at section B of 
the form.  Such increases or decreases in the rate shall be based on the 
date payment to the Contractor's foreign supplier is effected, provided 
such payment is made within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of 
importation and the date of importation is prior to the delivery date 
specified in the Contract. If payment to the Contractor's supplier is not 
made within thirty (30) calendar days, Canada may select the rate most 
advantageous to it within the 30-day period after importation.  However, in 
the case of importations made after the specified delivery date, Canada 
will select the exchange rate most advantageous to it within the 30-day 
period after the specified delivery date.

6.  On each invoice submitted against the Contract, the Contractor will 
show the exchange rate adjustment factor (either upward, downward or no 
change) as a separate item on the invoice and a copy of form DSS-MAS 9411 
with Part II fully completed.  The documentation is to show the date(s) the 
goods actually cleared customs into Canada, supported by a receipted copy 
of the relevant customs import entry form and evidence of payment to the 
Contractor's supplier.

7.  The Minister shall have the right to audit any revision to costs under 
   this clause.
