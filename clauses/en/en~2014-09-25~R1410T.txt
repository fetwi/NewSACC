<h2>R1410T GI1 (2014-09-25) Integrity Provisions - Proposal</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Proponents must comply with the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>. In addition, proponents must respond to bid solicitations in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the bid solicitations and resulting contracts, and submit bids as well as enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the contract.</li>
<li value="2">By submitting a bid, proponents confirm that they understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications is found by Canada to be untrue in any respect, at the time of contract award. If it is determined, after contract award, that the Proponent made a false declaration, Canada will, following a notice period, have the right to terminate the contract for default. The Proponent will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested. The Proponent and any of the Proponent's Affiliates will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions during the period of any contract resulting from this bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies, and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals, and directors, are Proponent's Affiliates if: 
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.</li>
<li value="4">	Proponents who are incorporated, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Proponent. Proponents bidding as sole proprietorship, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide the name of the owner. Proponents bidding as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.<br/>

If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of bids is completed, Canada will inform the Proponent of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to provide the names within the time frame specified will render the bid non-responsive. Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for contract award.<br/>

Canada may, at any time, request that the Proponent provide properly completed and signed consent forms (Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229) for any or all individuals mentioned above within a specified time frame. Failure to provide such consent forms and associated information within the time frame provided, or failure to cooperate to the verification process, will result in the bid being declared non-responsive.</li>
<li value="5">The Proponent must diligently inform Canada in writing of any change affecting the list of names of directors during this procurement process as well as during the contract period. The Proponent must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms.</li>
<li value="6">By submitting a bid, the Proponent certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware, that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility. Canada may also verify the information provided by the Proponent, including the information relating to the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="7">	By submitting a bid, the Proponent certifies that neither the Proponent nor any of the Proponent's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Contract if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite>Lobbying Act</cite>.</li>
<li value="8"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

In addition, for a conviction under paragraphs a. or b. of subsection 9, following the 10-year period, a pardon or a record suspension must have been obtained, or capacities must have been restored by the Governor in Council. The Proponent must therefore provide with its bid or promptly afterwards a copy of confirming documentation from an official source for its certification to be found true by Canada for the purpose of these Integrity Provisions. If the documentation has not been received by the time the evaluation of bids is completed, Canada will inform the Proponent of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to comply within the time frame specified will render the bid non-responsive.</li>
<li value="9">	By submitting a bid, the Proponent certifies that neither the Proponent nor any of the Proponent’s Affiliates have been convicted of an offence or received a conditional or an absolute discharge under any of the following provisions, unless the time period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, has elapsed:

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">paragraph 80(1)(d) (<em>False entry, certificate or return</em>), subsection 80(2) (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) or section 154.01 (<em>Fraud against Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="2">section 121 (<em>Frauds on the government and Contractor subscribing to election fund</em>), section 124 (<em>Selling or Purchasing Office</em>), section 380 (<em>Fraud</em>) for fraud committed against Her Majesty or section 418 (<em>Selling defective stores to Her Majesty</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="3">section 119 (<em>Bribery of judicial officers, etc</em>), section 120 (<em>Bribery of officers</em>), section 346 (<em>Extortion</em>), sections 366 to 368 (<em>Forgery and other offences resembling forgery</em>), section 382 (<em>Fraudulent manipulation of stock exchange transactions</em>), section 382.1 (<em>Prohibited insider trading</em>), section 397 (<em>Falsification of books and documents</em>), section 422 (<em>Criminal breach of contract</em>), section 426 (<em>Secret commissions</em>), section 462.31 (<em>Laundering proceeds of crime</em>) or sections 467.11 to 467.13 (<em>Participation in activities of criminal organization</em>) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, or</li>
<li value="4">section 45 (<em>Conspiracies, agreements or arrangements between competitors</em>), section 46 (<em>Foreign directives</em>), section 47 (<em>Bid rigging</em>), section 49 (<em>Agreements or arrangements of federal financial institutions</em>), section 52 (<em>False or misleading representation</em>), section 53 (<em>Deceptive notice of winning a prize</em>) of the <cite>Competition Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="5">section 239 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="6">section 327 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite>Excise Tax Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="7">section 3 (<em>Bribing a foreign public official</em>), section 4 (<em>Accounting</em>), or section 5 (<em>Offence committed outside Canada</em>) of the <cite>Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act</cite>, or</li>
<li value="8">section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</cite>.</li>
</ol>

The Proponent also certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a. or b. are to receive any benefit under a contract resulting from this bid solicitation, unless a pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, as defined in the Time Period subsection.</li>
<li value="10"><dfn>Foreign Offences</dfn><br/>
The Proponent also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Proponent nor any of the Proponent’s Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions. Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to the Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council.</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Sub-consultants</dfn><br/>
The Proponent must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no less favourable to Canada than those imposed in the resulting contract.</li>
<li value="12"><dfn>Preventive measures associated with the Time Period</dfn><br/>
In cases where the period (as defined in the Time Period subsection), for a conviction, or a conditional or an absolute discharge of the Proponent or any of the Proponent’s Affiliates has elapsed, then the Proponent must also certify for itself and for its Affiliates that measures have been diligently put in place in order to avoid the reoccurrence of such convictions or reprehensible actions.</li>
<li value="13"><dfn>Public Interest Exception</dfn><br/>
Proponents understand that Canada may enter into contract with a proponent, where the Proponent or the Proponent’s Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge for an offence specified in these Integrity Provisions, when required to do so by law or legal proceedings, or when Canada in its sole discretion considers it necessary to the public interest for reasons which include, but are not limited to: 


<ul>
<li>no one else is capable of performing the contract;</li>
<li>emergency;</li>
<li>national security;</li>
<li>health and safety;</li>
<li>economic harm.</li>
</ul>


If all bids are found non-responsive for reason of a listed relevant conviction or act, then Canada may invoke the public interest exception, as described in the paragraph above. In such cases, only bids containing a declaration concerning a relevant offence or act will be further considered. Canada may also elect to procure outside of the present process. In all cases, Canada reserves the right to impose additional conditions or measures to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.</li>
<li value="14"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
For governments, as well as entities controlled by a government, including Crown corporations, the present Integrity Provisions are reduced to complying with article 750 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, the <cite>Government Contracts Regulations</cite> and the <cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite>.</li>

<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI3 (2012-07-16) Overview
of Selection Procedure</h2>
<h3>3.1 Proposal</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Proposals are submitted following a "two-envelope"
procedure, in which Proponents submit the "technical" component of
their proposal in one envelope and the proposed price of the
services (price proposal) in a second envelope.</li>
<li value="2">The information that Proponents are required to
provide is set out in detail elsewhere in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>.</li>
<li value="3">In response to the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>, interested Proponents submit
a proposal in which they:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">indicate whether the proposal is submitted by an
individual firm or by a joint venture;</li>
<li value="2">if the proposal is submitted by a joint venture,
describe the proposed legal and working relationships of the joint
venture and the benefits to be gained by the formation of the joint
venture;</li>
<li value="3">identify the prime consultants and key sub
consultants and specialists proposed for inclusion in the

expertise and competence of the Consultant Team and Key Personnel
proposed to be assigned to perform the required services.</li>
<li value="6">comply with all other requirements set out in the
<abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Proposal Evaluation and Rating</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Technical components of all responsive proposals are
reviewed, evaluated and rated by a Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) Evaluation Board in accordance with the
criteria, components and weight factors set out in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>. Upon
completion of the evaluation, Technical Ratings are
established.</li>
<li value="2">Proposals achieving the minimum Technical Score
specified in the Submission Requirements and Evaluation section of
the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr> are further considered.</li>
<li value="3">The price envelopes of all responsive proposals are
opened upon completion of the technical evaluation. When there are
three or more responsive proposals, an average price is determined
by adding all the price proposals together and dividing the total
by the number of price proposals opened. This calculation will not
be conducted when one or two responsive proposals are
received.</li>
<li value="4">All price proposals which are greater than 25 percent
above the average price will cause their respective complete
proposals to be set aside and receive no further
consideration.</li>
<li value="5">The remaining price proposals are rated as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">The lowest price proposal receives a Price Rating of
100.</li>
<li value="2">The second, third, fourth and fifth lowest prices
receive Price Ratings of 80, 60, 40, and 20 respectively. All other
price proposals receive a Price Rating of 0.</li>
<li value="3">On the rare occasion where two (or more) price
proposals are identical, these price proposals receive the same
rating and the corresponding number of following ratings are
skipped.</li>
<li value="4">The Price Rating is multiplied by a predetermined
percentage factor to establish a Price Score.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="6">A price proposal in excess of any maximum funding
limit, when this limit has been set in the Supplementary
Instructions to Proponents, may result in disqualification of the
complete proposal.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.3 Total Score</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The total overall score (Total Score) assigned to
each Proponent's complete proposal is calculated as the aggregate
of:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Technical Score (first envelope of the proposal),
and</li>
<li value="2">the Price Score (second envelope of the
proposal).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Proponent receiving the highest Total Score is
the first entity that the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Evaluation Board will recommend for the
provision of the required services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.4 Notification</h3>
<p><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> normally expects to advise in writing unsuccessful
Proponents within one week after <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has entered into a
contractual arrangement with the successful Proponent.</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI4 (2012-07-16)
Procurement Business Number</h2>
<p>Proponents are required to have a Procurement Business Number (PBN) before contract award.

<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI5 (2003-05-30)
Responsive Proposals</h2>
<p>To be considered responsive, a proposal must meet all of the
mandatory requirements set out in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>. No further consideration
in the selection procedure will be given to a Proponent submitting
a non-responsive proposal.</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI6 (2011-05-16)
Completion of Submission</h2>
<p>The Proponent shall base the proposal on the applicable proposal
documents listed in the Supplementary Instructions to
Proponents.</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI7 (2014-03-01) Proposal
Price</h2>
<p>Unless specified otherwise elsewhere in the proposal
documents:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the price proposal shall be in Canadian currency,
and</li>
<li value="2">the price proposal shall not include any amount for Applicable Taxes, and</li>
<li value="3">the requirement does not offer exchange rate fluctuation risk mitigation. Requests for exchange rate fluctuation risk mitigation will not be considered. All proposals including such provision will render the proposal non-responsive.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI8 (2014-03-01)
Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive bid process,
enquiries and other communications regarding the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr> must be
directed only to the Contracting Authority identified in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>.
Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the proposal
being declared non-responsive.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to proponents, significant enquiries received and their replies will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS).</p>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI9 (2013-04-25)
Limitation of Submissions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A Proponent may not submit more than one proposal.
This limitation also applies to the persons or entities in the case
of a joint venture. If more than one proposal is received from a
Proponent (or, in the case of a joint venture, from the persons or
entities), all such proposals shall be rejected and no further
consideration shall be given.</li>
<li value="2">A joint venture is defined as an association of two
or more parties which combine their money, property, knowledge,
skills, time or other resources in a joint business enterprise
agreeing to share the profits and the losses and each having some
degree of control over the enterprise.</li>
<li value="3">An arrangement whereby Canada contracts directly with
a prime consultant who may retain sub-consultants or specialist
consultants to perform portions of the services is not a joint
venture arrangement. A sub-consultant or specialist consultant may,
therefore, be proposed as part of the Consultant Team by more than
one Proponent. The Proponent warrants that it has written permission from such sub-consultant or specialist consultant to propose their services in relation to the services to be performed.</li>
<li value="4">Notwithstanding paragraph 3. above, in order to avoid any conflict of interest, or any perception of conflict of interest, a Proponent shall not include in its submission another Proponent as a member of its consultant team, as a sub-consultant or specialist consultant.</li>
<li value="5">Any joint venture entered into for the provision of
professional services or other services must be in full compliance
with the requirements of any provincial or territorial law
pertaining thereto in the Province or Territory in which the
project is located.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI10 (2011- 05-16)
Licensing Requirements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Consultant Team members and Key Personnel shall be,
or be eligible to be licensed, certified or otherwise authorized to
provide the necessary professional services to the full extent that
may be required by provincial or territorial law in the Province or
Territory in which the project is located.</li>
<li value="2">By virtue of submission of a proposal, the Proponent
certifies that the Proponent's Consultant Team and Key Personnel
are in compliance with the requirements of subsection 1 above. The
Proponent acknowledges that <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> reserves the right to verify any
information in this regard and that false or erroneous
certification may result in the proposal being declared
non-responsive.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="clauseRef">R1410T</span> GI11 (2012-07-16)
Rejection of Proposal</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may reject a proposal where any of the
following circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Proponent has been declared ineligible for
selection, following unsatisfactory performance in a previous
project as determined in accordance with the department's
performance review procedures;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant
included as part of the proposal has been declared ineligible, for
selection for work with the department in accordance with the
performance review procedure referred to in paragraph 1.(a), which
would render the employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant
ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion of the
requirement the employee, sub-consultant or specialist consultant
is to perform;</li>
<li value="3">the Proponent is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li value="4">evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has been received with respect to the Proponent, any of its employees, any sub-consultant or any specialist consultant included as part of the proposal;</li>
<li value="5">evidence satisfactory to Canada that based on past conduct or behavior, the Proponent, a sub-consultant, a specialist consultant or a person who is to perform the Services is unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly;</li>
<li value="6">with respect to current or prior transactions with
the Government of Canada,

<ol type="i">
<li value="1">Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of taking
the services out of the consultant's hands, suspension or
termination for default with respect to a contract with the
Proponent, any of its employees, any sub-consultant or any
specialist consultant included as part of the proposal;</li>
<li value="2">Canada determines that the Proponent's performance on other
contracts, including the quality of the services provided and the
quality and timeliness of the delivery of the project, is
sufficiently poor to jeopardize the successful completion of the
requirement being bid on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject a proposal pursuant to
subsection 1.(f), the Contracting Authority will so inform the
Proponent and provide the Proponent ten (10) days within which to

proposal rejection.</li>

Venture</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A joint venture is an association of two or more

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Financial Capability Requirement: The Proponent must have the financial capability to fulfill this requirement. To determine the Proponent's financial capability, the Contracting Authority may, by written notice to the Proponent, require the submission of some or all of the financial information detailed below during the evaluation of proposals. The Proponent must provide the following information to the Contracting Authority within fifteen (15) working days of the request or as specified by the Contracting Authority in the notice:


<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Audited financial statements, if available, or the unaudited financial statements (prepared by the Proponent's outside accounting firm, if available, or prepared in-house if no external statements have been prepared) for the Proponent's last three fiscal years, or for the years that the Proponent has been in business if this is less than three years (including, as a minimum, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Retained Earnings, the Income Statement and any notes to the statements).
</li>
<li value="2">If the date of the financial statements in (a) above is more than five months before the date of the request for information by the Contracting Authority, the Proponent must also provide, unless this is prohibited by legislation for public companies, the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement), as of two months before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information.
</li>
<li value="3">If the Proponent has not been in business for at least one full fiscal year, the following must be provided:


<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the opening Balance Sheet on commencement of business (in the case of a corporation, the date of incorporation); and
</li>
<li value="2">the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement) as of two months before the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">A certification from the Chief Financial Officer or an authorized signing officer of the Proponent that the financial information provided is complete and accurate.
</li>
<li value="5">A confirmation letter from all of the financial institution(s) that have provided short-term financing to the Proponent outlining the total of lines of credit granted to the Proponent and the amount of credit that remains available and not drawn upon as of one month prior to the date on which the Contracting Authority requests this information.</li>
<li value="6">A detailed monthly Cash Flow Statement covering all the Proponent's activities (including the requirement) for the first two years of the requirement that is the subject of the bid solicitation, unless this is prohibited by legislation. This statement must detail the Proponent's major sources and amounts of cash and the major items of cash expenditures on a monthly basis, for all the Proponent's activities. All assumptions made should be explained as well as details of how cash shortfalls will be financed.</li>
<li value="7">A detailed monthly Project Cash Flow Statement covering the first two years of the requirement that is the subject of the bid solicitation, unless this is prohibited by legislation.

</li>
<li value="2">If the Proponent is a joint venture, the financial information required by the Contracting Authority must be provided by each member of the joint venture.
</li>
<li value="3">If the Proponent is a subsidiary of another company, then any financial information in 1. (a) to (e) above required by the Contracting Authority must be provided by the ultimate parent company. Provision of parent company financial information does not by itself satisfy the requirement for the provision of the financial information of the Proponent, and the financial capability of a parent cannot be substituted for the financial capability of the Proponent itself unless an agreement by the parent company to sign a Parental Guarantee, as drawn up by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), is provided with the required information.
</li>
<li value="4">Financial Information Already Provided to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>: The Proponent is not required to resubmit any financial information requested by the Contracting Authority that is already on file at <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with the Contract Cost Analysis, Audit and Policy Directorate of the Policy, Risk, Integrity and Strategic Management Sector, provided that within the above-noted time frame:

<li value="1">the Proponent identifies to the Contracting Authority in writing the specific information that is on file and the requirement for which this information was provided; and
</li>
<li value="2">the Proponent authorizes the use of the information for this requirement.
</li>
</ol>
It is the Proponent's responsibility to confirm with the Contracting Authority that this information is still on file with <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.
</li>
<li value="5">Other Information: Canada reserves the right to request from the Proponent any other information that Canada requires to conduct a complete financial capability assessment of the Proponent.
</li>
<li value="6">Confidentiality: If the Proponent provides the information required above to Canada in confidence while indicating that the disclosed information is confidential, then Canada will treat the information in a confidential manner as permitted by the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>., 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. A-1, Section 20(1) (b) and (c).
</li>
<li value="7">Security: In determining the Proponent's financial capability to fulfill this requirement, Canada may consider any security the Proponent is capable of providing, at the Proponent's sole expense (for example, an irrevocable letter of credit from a registered financial institution drawn in favour of Canada, a performance guarantee from a third party or some other form of security, as determined by Canada).
</li>
<li value="8">In the event that a proposal is found to be non-compliant on the basis that the Proponent is considered not to be financially capable of performing the subject requirement, official notification shall be provided to the Proponent.

Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, Proponents are advised that Canada may reject a proposal
in the following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of
interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Proponent, any of its sub-consultants, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available
to other Proponents and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or
appear to give the Proponent an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a Proponent who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
bid solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in
itself, be considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage
or creating a conflict of interest. This Proponent remains however
subject to the criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a proposal under this
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Proponent and
provide the Proponent an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Proponents who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a proposal, the Proponent
represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of
interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Proponent
acknowledges that it is within Canada's sole discretion to
determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an
appearance of conflict of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>

Proponent or Potential Proponent shall have any claim for any
compensation of any kind whatsoever in relation to this <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>, or any
