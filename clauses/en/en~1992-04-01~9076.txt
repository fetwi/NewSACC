       (a)    any suspension or change in the scope of the work results in 
              an increase or decrease in the cost directly related to the

              termination and any other cost directly and necessarily 
              incurred as a result of the termination, but in no event 
              shall the aggregate of the price paid to date and any amounts

       force relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, the Minister may, 
       by giving notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the whole 
       or any part of the Contract. Upon the giving of such notice, the

       reason of the default or occurrence upon which such notice was based.  

(2)    If after notice of termination of the Contract under the provisions 
       of subsection (1) of this section, it is determined by the Minister 
       that the default of the Contractor is due to causes beyond the 
       control of the Contractor, such notice of termination shall be 
       deemed to have been issued pursuant to section 15 (Termination) of 
       these general conditions and the rights and obligations of the 
       parties hereto shall be governed by that section.  

(3)    Upon termination of the Contract under this section, the Minister 
       may require the Contractor to deliver to Her Majesty, in the manner 
       and to the extent directed by the Minister, any work which has not 
       been delivered/performed and accepted prior to such termination. 
       Subject to the deduction of any claim which Her Majesty may have 
       against the Contractor arising under the contract or out of the 
       termination, Her Majesty shall pay the Contractor for all such work 
       delivered/performed pursuant to such direction and accepted by Her 
       Majesty, the cost to the Contractor of such work plus the 
       proportionate part of any fee fixed by the said Contract and shall 
       pay or reimburse the Contractor the reasonable and proper costs to 
       the Contractor of all materials, parts or work in process delivered 
       to Her Majesty pursuant to such direction, but in no event shall the 
       aggregate of the price paid to date of default and any amounts 
       otherwise payable pursuant to this subsection (3) exceed the total 
       Contract price.
