<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in contracts when institutions listed in Schedule I, 
I.1 and II of the Financial Administration Act must comply with the Treasury 
Board (TB) policy on Common Look and Feel (CLF) Standards for the Internet.

CLF Standards offer a consistent and predictable presentation of government 
services and content, which facilitate effective online interaction between the 
Government of Canada and Canadians.  CLF provides standards on web addresses, 
common web page formats, e-mail, accessibility, interoperability and usability 
of websites.

CLF Standards are revised periodically by TB; the most recent version may be 
found at the following address: http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/cio-dpi/pols_e.asp.

Any contract for electronic goods or services that are related to public facing 
websites or sub-sites and public facing web applications of the Government of 
Canada, performed for a department or agency that is an institution listed in 
the above mentioned schedules of the Act, should contain a clause referring the 
contractor to the obligation of complying with the most recent version of the 
CLF Standards.

CLF Standards may also be complemented by standards and guidelines developed by 
institutions.  It is therefore necessary to refer to those standards and 
guidelines as well.</pre>
