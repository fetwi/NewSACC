<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Where applicable, the General Conditions are amended by deleting the 
       section entitled "Interest on Overdue Accounts" or "Payment", 
       whichever forms part of the Contract.

2.     For the purposes of this clause:

       "<strong>Average Rate</strong>" means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank Rates in 
       effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during the 
       calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in 
       which payment is made, where the "<strong>Bank Rate</strong>" means the rate of 
       interest established from time to time by the Bank of Canada as the 
       minimum rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short term advances 
       to members of the Canadian Payments Association.

       "<strong>date of payment</strong>" means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn 
       by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an 
       amount due and payable;

       an amount is "<strong>due and payable</strong>" when it is due and payable by Canada 
       to the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract; and

       an amount becomes "<strong>overdue</strong>" when it is unpaid on the first day 
       following the day upon which it is due and payable.

3.     Canada shall be liable to pay to the Contractor simple interest at 
       the Average Rate plus 3 percent per annum on any amount that is 
       overdue, from the date such amount becomes overdue until the day 
       prior to the date of payment, inclusive. Interest shall be paid 
       without notice from the Contractor except in respect of payment 
       which is less than fifteen (15) days overdue. No interest will be 
       payable or paid in respect of payment made within such fifteen (15) 
       days unless the Contractor so requests after payment has become due.

4.     Canada shall not be liable to pay interest in accordance with this 
       clause if Canada is not responsible for the delay in paying the 
       Contractor.

5.     Canada shall not be liable to pay interest on overdue advance 
       payments.
