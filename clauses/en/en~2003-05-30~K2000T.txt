<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP EE) 
       requires that Canadian organizations bidding for federal government 
       contracts, $200,000 and over, make a formal commitment to implement 
       employment equity, as a pre-condition to the validation of their 
       bids.  If the bidder is subject to the Program, evidence of its 
       commitment must be provided prior to the award of any contract. 

       (a)    The program requirements do not apply to organizations which: 
              (CHECK THE APPROPRIATE ITEM IF APPLICABLE)

              (   )  have fewer than 100 permanent part-time and/or full 
                            time employees across Canada or;

              (   )  are a federally regulated employer.

       (b)    If the bidder's organization does not fall within the 
              parameters of items above, the program requirements do apply 
              and, as such the bidder is required to submit a duly signed 
              Certificate of Commitment as referenced below, or its 
              Certificate number _______ confirming its adherence to the 
              program. 

2.     In all cases, the bidder is required to produce evidence of 
       supporting information on demand, if such evidence is not provided 
       with its bid.  Under no circumstance will a contract be awarded to 
       an organization that does not comply with the requirements of the 
       FCP EE, unless it is exempt from the Program. 

NOTE: 

1.     The FCP EE applies to Canadian-based bidders only. 

2.     The Certificate of Commitment, criteria and other information about 
       the FCP EE, are available in the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and 
       Conditions</em> Manual, Section 2.1, Employment Equity - Federal 
       Contractors Program, and Form 2.1.1, Certificate of Commitment -
