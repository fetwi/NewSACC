<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>(a)    Litigation Rights:  Consistent with subsection 5(d) of the <em>
       Department of Justice Act</em>, R.S.C. 1993, c. J-2, s.1, it is 
       understood and agreed that where any suit is instituted for or 
       against Canada which the Insurer or Insurers would, but for this 
       clause, have the right to pursue or defend on behalf of Canada as an 
       Additional Insured under this insurance policy, the Insurer shall 
       promptly contact the Attorney General of Canada to agree on the 
       legal strategies by sending a registered letter, or by courier with 
       an acknowledgement of receipt,

       for the province of Quebec, to:

       Director
       Business Law Directorate
       Quebec Regional Office (Ottawa)
       Department of Justice
       284 Wellington Street, Room SAT-6042
       Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

              and

       for all other provinces and territories, to:

       Senior General Counsel
       Civil Litigation Section
       Department of Justice
       234 Wellington Street, East Tower
       Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

       The notification must be followed, within a reasonable period, by an 
       information copy to the Contracting Authority.

       The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right to co-defend 
       any action brought against Canada.  However, all expenses incurred 
       by Canada to co-defend such actions would be at Canada's expense.  
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Canada decides to co-defend any 
       action brought against it, and Canada will not agree to a proposed 
       settlement documented and agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and 
       the plaintiff(s) that would result in the settlement or dismissal of 
       the action as against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the 
       Contractor's insurer for any difference between the proposed amount 
       for which the action as against Canada would have been settled and 
       the amount finally awarded or paid to the plaintiffs (inclusive of 
       costs and interest) on behalf of Canada. 

(b)    Additional Named Insured:  Canada is included as an Additional Named 
       Insured, but only with respect to liabilities that may arise from 
       the Contractor's own negligence in the performance of the contract.

(c)    Independent Contractors Liability (if any):  Unless otherwise 
       insured elsewhere, and evidence thereof is secured by the Contractor, 
       all subcontractors are included as Insured by the policy.

(d)    Non-Owned Automobile:  To protect the Contractor for liabilities 
       arising by its use of vehicles owned by other parties including 
       Canada.

(e)    Sudden and Accidental Pollution Liability (minimum 72 hours):  To 
       protect the Contractor for liabilities arising from damages caused 
       by accidental pollution incidents. 
 
(f)    Elevator Collision Liability:  To protect the Contractor for 
       liabilities arising from premises with operational elevators.

(g)    Tenants' Legal Liability Broad Form:  To protect the Contractor for 
       liabilities arising by its occupancy of leased premises.

(h)    Extended Claims Reporting Period (12 months):  If this is a claims 
       made policy concurrent with the term of the Contract and its renewal 
       is not intended by the Contractor, this endorsement must be secured 
       by the Contractor by provision of an insurers Letter of Intent, to 
       be submitted with the policy upon the execution of the Contract.

(i)    Personal Injury Broad Form:  While not limited to, the endorsement 
       should include coverage for Violation of Privacy, Libel and Slander, 
       False Arrest, Detention or Imprisonment and Defamation of Character.

(j)    Products and Completed Operations Broad Form (24 months):  While not 
       limited to, the endorsement should include service, assembly and 
       repair activities as well as material, parts or equipment furnished
