<p>Compliance with the certifications bidders provide to Canada is
subject to verification by Canada during the bid evaluation period
(before award of a contract) and after contract award. The
Contracting Authority will have the right to ask for additional
information to verify bidders' compliance with the certifications
before award of a contract. The bid will be declared non-responsive
if any certification made by the Bidder is untrue, whether made
knowingly or unknowingly. Failure to comply with the certifications
or to comply with the request of the Contracting Authority for
additional information will also render the bid non-responsive.</p>
