<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>It is highly advisable that all contracts contain this clause.  Commercial 
General Liability insurance protects the Contractor against claims for damages 
(principally property damage and bodily injury), the Contractor may cause by 
negligence in its activities and operations whilst in performance of the 
Contract.

This clause comprises essential endorsements applicable to government 
procurement contracts.  The noted description of the endorsements convey only 
the intent of the coverage sought and standard insurance industry wording is the 
expected requirement.

The contracting officer should also refer to G2015D for important additional 
endorsements that may apply to specific contracting areas and that are to be 
individually selected and included in the endorsements found in this clause.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $2,000,000 per accident or occurrence is not 
sufficient, alternate limits may be established in consultation with the client 
and Public Works and Government Services Canada's Risk Management and Insurance 
Advisory Services at NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca.
