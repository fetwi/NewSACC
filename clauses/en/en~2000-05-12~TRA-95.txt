       Contract</em> are, at the time of acceptance, in accordance with the 
       requirements of the present <em>Contract</em>.  If the <em>Contractor</em> is required 
       to correct or replace the <em>Work</em> or any portion thereof, it shall be

Canada</em>.  The <em>Contracting Authority</em>, or his representative, shall have 
access to the <em>Work</em> at any time during working hours where any part of the <em>
Work</em> is being carried out.  Should the <em>Work</em> or any part thereof not be in 
accordance with the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Contracting Authority</em> 
shall have the right to reject the <em>Work</em> and require its correction or 
replacement at the <em>Contractor</em>'s expense.  The <em>Contracting Authority</em> shall 
inform the <em>Contractor</em> of the reasons for any such rejection.  Inspection by 
the <em>Contracting Authority</em> shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from its 
responsibility to meet the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>TRA-95 07     (15/12/95)    Compliance with Applicable Laws</strong>

The <em>Contractor</em> shall comply with all laws applicable to the performance of

       out of similar contracts.

2.     In any <em>Subcontract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall, unless the <em>Minister</em> 
       otherwise consents in writing, ensure that the subcontractor is 
       bound by terms and conditions compatible with and, in the opinion of 
       the <em>Minister</em>, not less favourable to <em>Canada</em> than the terms and 
       conditions of the <em>Contract</em>.  Deviations in any <em>Subcontract </em>from the 
       terms of the <em>Contract</em>, including any right of termination of the <em>
       Contract</em>, shall be entirely at the risk of the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     Any consent to a <em>Subcontract</em> shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from

       subcontractor.
 
<strong>TRA-95 09     (15/12/95)    Replacement of Personnel</strong>

       who shall perform the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall provide the 
       services of the persons so named unless the <em>Contractor</em> is unable to 
       do so for reasons beyond its control.

2.     If, at any time, the <em>Contractor</em> is unable to provide the services of 
       any specific person named in the <em>Contract</em>, it shall provide a 
       replacement person with the same qualifications and experience.

3.     Before replacing any person named in the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall give notice to the <em>Minister</em> in writing of:

       (a)    the reason for the removal of the named person from the <em>Work</em>;

       (b)    the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed

       (c)    proof that the person has the required security clearance 
              granted by <em>Canada</em>, if applicable.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall not, in any event, allow performance of the <em>
       Work</em> by unauthorized replacement persons; acceptance of a 
       replacement person by the <em>Contracting Authority</em> shall not relieve 
       the <em>Contractor</em> from its responsibility to meet the requirements of 
       the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     The <em>Minister</em> may order the removal from the <em>Work</em> of any such 
       replacement person and the <em>Contractor</em> shall immediately remove the 
       person from the <em>Work</em> and shall, in accordance with subsection (2) 
       and paragraphs (3)(b) and (c), secure a further replacement.


<strong>TRA-95 10     (15/12/95)    Assignment</strong>

       Contractor</em> without the prior consent in writing of the <em>Minister</em> and 
       any purported assignment made without that consent is void and of no 
       effect.

2.     No assignment of the <em>Contract</em> shall relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from any 
       obligation under the <em>Contract</em> or impose any liability upon <em>Canada</em> or 
       the <em>Minister</em>, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the <em>Minister</em>.


<strong>TRA-95 11     (15/12/95)    Time is of the Essence</strong>

1.     Time is of the essence of the <em>Contract</em>.

2.     When the performance of the <em>Work</em> or any part of it is delayed or 
       likely to be delayed owing solely to an event that:

       (a)    was beyond the reasonable control of the <em>Contractor</em>,

       (b)    could not reasonably have been foreseen,

       (c)    could not reasonably have been prevented by means reasonably 
              available to the <em>Contractor</em>, and

       (d)    occurred without the fault or neglect of the <em>Contractor</em>,

       the <em>Minister</em> may extend the time for completing the <em>Work</em> by a period 
       equal to the length of the delay so caused provided that prompt 
       notice of the occurrence causing or likely to cause such delay is 
       given by the <em>Contractor</em> to the <em>Minister</em>.

       for performance of all or part of the <em>Work</em>.  Classified documents 
       are to be delivered solely to those persons holding an appropriate 
       security clearance, and the <em>Contractor</em> shall ensure that all 
       employees designated to perform the <em>Work</em>, or who have access to the <em>
       Work</em>, have a valid security clearance issued by the CIISD at a level 
       appropriate to the classification of the <em>Work</em>, for the full term of 
       the <em>Contract</em>.

2.     Before being permitted to receive classified documents, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall have a valid security clearance at the appropriate 
       level issued by the CIISD for its facilities for the full term of 
       the <em>Contract</em>, and unless it receives authorization in writing to the 
       contrary from the <em>Project Authority</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall not remove 
       any classified documents from the authorized work premises and shall 
       ensure that its employees are aware of and comply with this 
       requirement.

3.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall stamp the appropriate security classification 
       on the <em>Work</em> produced by the <em>Contractor</em> under the <em>Contract</em>, and shall 
       neither keep or reproduce classified documents or translations of 
       these, nor reveal their contents.  Upon completion of the <em>Work</em>, all 
       classified documents provided by <em>Canada</em> or produced by the <em>
       Contractor</em> under the <em>Contract</em>, as well as all the rough drafts,

       envelope being marked at the required security level, and the outer 
       one bearing only the addresses of the addressee and sender.

4.     These clauses shall be included in all subcontracts requiring access 
       to classified documents.

       under the <em>Contract</em>.

              parts of the <em>Work</em> will be free from all claims, liens, 
              attachments, charges or encumbrances; and

       (d)    in the case of payment in respect of finished work, the 
              finished work has been inspected by <em>Canada</em> and accepted as 
              being in accordance with the <em>Contract</em>.

4.     The <em>Minister</em> shall notify the <em>Contractor</em>, within fifteen (15) days 
       of receipt of an invoice, of any inadequacy of the invoice or of the 
       supporting documentation, and where such notice is given within that 
       period the date for payment of the amount invoiced shall be 
       postponed until the <em>Contractor</em> remedies the inadequacy to the 
       satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em>.

5.     The amount claimed by the <em>Contractor</em> under the <em>Contract</em> may be 
       audited by <em>Canada</em> before or after payment of that amount has been 
       made to the <em>Contractor</em>. Any payment made prior to the inspection 
       shall be considered as an interim payment only, and that amount 
       shall be amended accordingly, on the basis of the findings of the 
       audit. Where an overpayment has been made, that amount shall be 
       immediately repaid to <em>Canada</em> by the <em>Contractor</em>.

<strong>TRA-95 22     (15/12/95)    Suspension of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Minister</em> may at any time, by written notice, order the <em>
       Contractor</em> to suspend or stop all or part of the <em>Work</em> under the <em>
       Contract</em>.  The <em>Contractor</em> shall immediately comply with any such 
       order in the manner that minimizes the cost of so doing.  At any 
       time during the period of the suspension or stopping of the <em>Work</em>, 
       the <em>Minister</em> may either rescind the order or terminate the <em>Contract</em>, 
       in whole or in part, under section 23 (Default by the Contractor) or 
       terminate it under section 24 (Termination for Convenience). 

2.     When an order is made under subsection 1, unless the <em>Minister</em> 
       terminates the <em>Contract</em> by reason of default by the <em>Contractor</em> or 
       the <em>Contractor</em> abandons the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall be 
       entitled to be paid its additional costs incurred as a result of the 
       suspension plus a fair and reasonable profit thereon. 

3.     When an order is made under subsection 1 and is rescinded:

       (a)    the <em>Contractor</em> shall as soon as practicable resume work in 
              accordance with the <em>Contract</em>;

       (b)    if the suspension has affected the <em>Contractor</em>'s ability to 
              meet any delivery date under the <em>Contract</em>, the date for the 
              performance of that part of the <em>Work</em> affected by the 
              suspension shall be extended for a period equal to the period 
              of suspension plus a period, if any, which in the opinion of 
              the <em>Minister</em> following consultation with the <em>Contractor</em> is 
              reasonably necessary for the <em>Contractor</em> to resume the <em>Work</em>; 
              and

       (c)    subject to section 4 (Amendments), an equitable adjustment 
              shall be made as necessary to affected terms and conditions 
              of the <em>Contract</em>. 


<strong>TRA-95 23     (15/12/95)    Default by the Contractor</strong>

1.     Where the <em>Contractor</em> is in default in carrying out its obligations 
       under the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may, upon giving written notice to 
       the <em>Contractor</em>, terminate for default the whole or any part of the <em>
       Contract</em>, either immediately or at the expiration of a cure period 
       specified in the notice if the <em>Contractor</em> has not cured the default 
       to the satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> within that cure period.

2.     Where the <em>Contractor</em> becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an 
       assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit of any 
       statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or where a 
       receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a receiving order 
       is made against the <em>Contractor</em>, or an order is made or a resolution 
       passed for the winding up of the <em>Contractor</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may, to 
       the extent permitted by the laws of <em>Canada</em>, upon giving notice to 
       the <em>Contractor</em>, immediately terminate for default the whole or any 
       part of the <em>Contract</em>. 

3.     Upon the giving of a notice provided for in subsection 1 or 2, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall have no claim for further payment other than as 
       provided in this section, but shall be liable to <em>Canada</em> for any 
       amounts, including milestone payments, paid by <em>Canada</em> and for all 
       losses and damages which may be suffered by <em>Canada</em> by reason of the 
       default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including any 
       increase in the cost incurred by <em>Canada</em> in procuring the <em>Work</em> from 
       another source or calling upon its internal resources.  The <em>
       Contractor</em> agrees to repay immediately to <em>Canada</em> the portion of any 
       advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination. 
       Nothing in this section affects any obligation of <em>Canada</em> under the 
       law to mitigate damages.

4.     Upon termination of the <em>Contract</em> under this section, the <em>Minister</em> 
       may require the <em>Contractor</em> to deliver to <em>Canada</em>, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the <em>Minister</em>, any completed parts of the <em>
       Work</em> which have not been delivered and accepted prior to the 
       termination and any materials or work-in-
process which the <em>Contractor</em> has produced specifically in the fulfilment of 
the <em>Contract</em>.
 
5.     Subject to the deduction of any claim that <em>Canada</em> may have against 
       the <em>Contractor</em> arising under the <em>Contract</em> or out of the termination, <em>
       Canada</em> shall pay or credit to the <em>Contractor</em> the value, determined 
       on the basis of the <em>Contract Price</em>, including the proportionate part 
       of the <em>Contractor</em>'s profit or fee included in the <em>Contract Price</em>, of 
       all completed parts of the <em>Work</em> delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to a 
       direction under subsection 4 and accepted by <em>Canada</em>, and shall pay 
       or credit to the <em>Contractor</em> the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> that the <em>
       Minister</em> considers reasonable in respect of all materials and 
       work-in-
process delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to a direction under subsection 4 and 
accepted by <em>Canada</em>, but in no event shall the aggregate of the amounts paid 
by <em>Canada</em> under the <em>Contract</em> to the date of termination and any amounts 
payable pursuant to this subsection exceed the <em>Contract Price</em>.

6.     Titles to all materials, work-in-process and finished work, in 
       respect of which payment is made to the <em>Contractor</em> shall, upon such 
       payment being made, pass to and vest in <em>Canada</em> unless already so 
       vested under any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, and such materials, 
       work-in-process and finished work shall be delivered according to 
       the order of the <em>Minister</em>, but <em>Canada</em> will not accept and will not 
       pay for those that would not have been required to perform the <em>Work</em> 
       or that exceed what would have been required to perform the <em>Work</em>.

7.     Where, subsequent to issuance of an order pursuant to subsection 1, 
       the <em>Minister</em> is satisfied that grounds did not exist for a 
       termination under this section, the notice shall be deemed a notice 
       of termination for convenience issued under subsection 1 of section 
       24 (Termination for Convenience).


<strong>TRA-95 24     (15/12/95)    Termination for Convenience</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding anything contained in this <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Minister</em> 
       may, at any time prior to the completion of the <em>Work</em>, by giving 
       notice to the <em>Contractor</em> (in this section sometimes referred to as a 
       "termination notice"), terminate the <em>Contract</em> as regards all or any 
       part of the <em>Work</em> not completed. Upon a termination notice being 
       given, the <em>Contractor</em> shall cease work in accordance with and to the 
       extent specified in the notice, but shall proceed to complete any 
       such part or parts of the <em>Work</em> as are not affected by the 
       termination notice. The <em>Minister</em> may, at any time or from time to 
       time, give one or more additional termination notices with respect 
       to any or all parts of the <em>Work</em> not terminated by any previous 
       termination notice.

2.     In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to 
       subsection 1, the <em>Contractor</em> shall be entitled to be paid, to the 
       extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for 
       purposes of performing the <em>Contract</em> and to the extent that the <em>
       Contractor</em> has not already been so paid or reimbursed by <em>Canada</em> 
       including the unliquidated portion of any advance payment:

       (a)    on the basis of the <em>Contract Price</em>, for all completed <em>Work</em> 
              that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the <em>
              Contract</em>, whether completed before, or after and in 
              compliance with the instructions contained in, the 
              termination notice;

       (b)    the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> plus a fair and reasonable profit 
              thereon, for all <em>Work</em> terminated by the termination notice 
              before completion, the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> being 
              determined in accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em>;

       (c)    all costs of and incidental to the termination of the <em>Work</em> or 
              part thereof, including the Cost of cancellation of 
              obligations incurred by the <em>Contractor</em> with respect to the 
              terminated <em>Work</em> or part thereof, but not including the cost 
              of severance payments or damages to employees whose services 
              are no longer required by reason of the termination except 
              wages that the <em>Contractor</em> is obligated by statute to pay them 
              and except for reasonable severance payments or damages paid 
              to employees hired to perform the <em>Contract</em> whose hiring was 
              expressly required by <em>Contract</em> or approved in writing by the <em>
              Minister</em> for the purpose of the <em>Contract</em>. 

3.     The <em>Minister</em> may reduce the payment in respect of any of the <em>Work</em> to 
       the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in meeting the 
       requirements of the <em>Contract</em>. 
4.     Notwithstanding anything in subsection 2, the total of the amounts 
       to which the <em>Contractor</em> is entitled under paragraphs 2 (a) and (b), 
       together with any other amounts paid or due to the <em>Contractor</em> under 
       other provisions of the <em>Contract</em>, shall not exceed the <em>Contract 
       Price</em> or the portion thereof that is applicable to the part of the <em>
       Work</em> that is terminated, and shall not exceed the proportion of the 
       price quoted by the <em>Contractor</em> for all the <em>Work</em> that is reasonably 
       attributable to the proportion of the <em>Work</em> performed to the 
       effective date of the termination.

5.     In the subcontracting of any of the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall, 
       unless otherwise authorized by the <em>Minister</em>, place subcontracts on 
       terms that will enable the <em>Contractor</em> to terminate the same upon 
       terms and conditions similar in effect to those provided in this 
       section, and generally the <em>Contractor</em> shall co-
operate with the <em>Minister</em> and do everything reasonably within its power at 
all times to minimize the amount of <em>Canada</em>'s obligations in the event of  a 
termination under this section.

6.     Title to all equipment, work-in-process and finished work in respect 
       of which payment is made to the <em>Contractor</em> shall, upon such payment 
       being made, pass to and vest in <em>Canada</em> unless already so vested 
       under any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, and such work-in-process 
       and finished work shall be delivered according to the order of the <em>
       Minister</em>, but <em>Canada</em> will not accept and will not pay for work-in-
process that would not have been required to perform the <em>Work</em> or that 
exceed what would have been required to perform the <em>Work</em>.

7.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of, or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of, any action or termination notice given by 
       the <em>Minister</em> under this section, except to the extent that this 
       section expressly provides.

       the <em>Contractor</em> of the <em>Work</em> and of all expenditures or commitments 
       made by the <em>Contractor</em> in connection therewith, and shall keep all 
       invoices, receipts and vouchers relating thereto. The <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall not, without the prior written consent of the <em>Minister</em>, 
       dispose of any such accounts, records, invoices, receipts or 
       vouchers until the expiration of 6 years after final payment under 
       this <em>Contract</em>, or until the settlement of all outstanding claims and

       authorized representatives of the <em>Minister</em>, who may make copies and 
       take extracts thereof.  The <em>Contractor</em> shall provide all facilities 
       for such audits and inspections and shall furnish all such 
       information as the representatives of the <em>Minister</em> may from time to 
       time require with respect to such accounts, records, invoices, 
       receipts and vouchers.
