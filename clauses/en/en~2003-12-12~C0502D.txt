       authorization and a report containing such details as Canada may 
       require with respect to the overtime work performed pursuant to the 
       written authorization.

2.     If overtime is authorized, the Contractor will be paid the contract 
       price/rate plus the following premium rates: 

       For Time and one half:      $_________ per hour, or
