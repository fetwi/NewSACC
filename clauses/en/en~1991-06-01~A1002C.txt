<pre>Use the following clause in all Science contracts issued by contracting 
personnel located in Regional Science and Professional Services sections. Do not 
utilize the title "Regional Science Contracting Officer" as the other Science 
contract clauses refer to Science Contracting Officer.  In using the latter 
title, a good deal of duplication of clauses is avoided.
