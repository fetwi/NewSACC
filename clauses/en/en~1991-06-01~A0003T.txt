<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>Proposals will be evaluated using "best value" (scientific merit, price and 
possible socio-economic factors) criteria rather than "scientific merit" or 
"price" only.  The "best value" selection will be assessed utilizing the 
following criteria.  Bidders are advised to address each of these criteria:

1.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL (40 POINTS) 
2.  MANAGERIAL (30 POINTS) 
3.  COMPANY EXPERIENCE (28 POINTS) 
4.  FINANCIAL (NO POINT ALLOCATION)

NOTE TO BIDDERS:

Proposals shall be signed.

Bidders are advised to address the proposal in sufficient depth and to 
provide a "Cross Reference" index, identifying paragraphs and page numbers 
corresponding to each of the Evaluation Criteria.

In order to be considered technically acceptable, a proposal must score at 
least 70 percent of the total points of each of the evaluation criteria.  
Where two or more acceptable proposals are received, socio-economic factors 
may be used to make the final decision.

Neither the qualifying proposals which scores the highest number of rating 
points nor the one which contains the lowest cost estimate will necessarily 
be accepted.  The selection of the Contractor will be made on the basis of 
the best overall value to the Crown in terms of technical merit and cost.  
Therefore, particular attention will be paid to determine whether the 
acceptance of a proposal merits the payment of a premium.  This 
determination will be based on a "dollar per point evaluation" (bid price 
divided by rating points).

After the proposal closing date, no amendment to the proposal will be 
accepted.  However, during the evaluation, representatives of _____ and 
Supply and Services Canada may, at their discretion, conduct interviews 
with bidders to obtain clarification.

For the purpose of evaluating your proposal, you agree that representatives 
   of the Crown may interview key personnel and conduct a survey of your 
   facilities, your technical abilities and your financial status, to 
   determine if they would be adequate for the proper performance of the 
   proposed contract.  You agree to make your facilities available for this 
   purpose.
