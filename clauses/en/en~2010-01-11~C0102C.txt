<p>The Contractor's certification that the price quoted is based on
costs computed in accordance with 10.40(a) to (i) of the <cite>Supply
Manual</cite>, Public Works and Government Services Canada, on the
pricing of research and development contracts with universities and
colleges is subject to audit. The audit will determine if the total
price charged by the Contractor on a single contract, when only one
exists, or a series of negotiated firm price contracts, when more
than one exists, is in accordance with the procedures.</p>
<p>If the audit demonstrates that the certification is in error
after payment is made to the Contractor, the Contractor must, at
the discretion of Canada, refund any overpayment or authorize the
retention by Canada of the overpayment by way of deduction from any
sum of money that may be due or payable to the Contractor pursuant
to the Contract.</p>
<p>If the audit demonstrates that the certification is in error
before payment is made, the Contractor agrees that any pending
invoice will be adjusted by Canada in accordance with the results
of the audit. It is further agreed that if the Contract is still in
effect at the time of the verification, the price will be lowered
in accordance with the results of the audit.</p>
