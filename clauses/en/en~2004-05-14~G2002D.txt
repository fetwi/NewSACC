<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause when the contract services are of professional or 
prescribed nature.

Professional or prescribed services may be defined as, but not limited to, 
consulting, design, training, educational, management, architectural, health, 
engineering, research &amp; development or related to government policy.

If either the contracting officer or the client believe that the suggested

limits may be established in consultation with the client and the Risk 
Management and Insurance Advisor, Public Works and Government Services Canada 
(NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca).

Refer to G2015D for important additional endorsements that may apply to specific
