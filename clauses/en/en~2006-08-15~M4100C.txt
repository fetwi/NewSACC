<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all standing offers where the winning offeror's 
eligibility for consideration required the completion and submission of a signed 
Canadian Content certification.
</pre>
</section>
<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     The Offeror represents and warrants that the certification of 
       Canadian Content submitted with its offer is accurate and complete, 
       and that the goods and services to be provided to Canada pursuant to 
       this Standing Offer will be in accordance with the said 
       certification.  The Offeror acknowledges that Canada has relied upon 
       such representation and warranty to issue the Standing Offer.  Such 
       representation and warranty may be verified in such manner as Canada 
       may reasonably require.

2.     The Contractor acknowledges that in the event of a breach of such 
       covenant, Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting 
       from the Standing Offer as being in default in accordance with the 
       default provisions of the Contract.

3.     The Offeror must keep proper records and documentation relating to 
       the origin of the goods and services provided to Canada.  The 
       Offeror must not, without obtaining before the written consent of 
       Canada, dispose of any such records or documentation until the 
       expiration of six (6) years after final payment under any contract 
       resulting from the Standing Offer, or until settlement of all 
       outstanding claims and disputes, whichever is later.  All such 
       records and documentation must at all times during the 
       aforementioned retention period be open to audit, inspection and 
       examination by the authorized representatives of Canada, who may 
       make copies and take extracts thereof.  The Offeror must provide all 
       facilities for such audits, inspections and examinations, and must 
       furnish all such information as the representatives of Canada may 
       from time to time require with respect to such records and 
       documentation.

4.     Nothing in this clause must be interpreted as limiting the rights 
       and remedies which Canada may otherwise have in relation to or 
       pursuant to any contract resulting from the Standing Offer.
