<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Work described in the Contract involves submarine systems or equipment 
classified as First Level or otherwise critical to submarine safety, as 
defined in Canadian Forces Technical Order (CFTO) C-23-VIC-000/AM-001, 
Quality Assurance for Safety in Submarines VICTORIA Class.  Manufacture, 
repair, overhaul, installation, inspection and tests for each such item 
identified in the requirement must be documented in accordance with the 
requirements of the above mentioned CFTO.

For each such item, the Contractor must provide a Certificate of Conformity 
[form DND 2327 or locally produced equivalent approved by the Quality 
Assurance Authority (QAA)] in accordance with this CFTO.  For subcontracted 
work, the Contractor must obtain that Certificate of Conformity from the 
subcontractor.  Obtaining the said certificate from a subcontractor does 
not relieve the Contractor from its obligation to ensure compliance with 
the technical requirements of the Contract, nor must it be construed as 
authorizing any liability on the part of Canada to the subcontractor.

For each such item, the Certificate of Conformity, along with certified 
true copies of any deviation, waiver and all required records identified in 
the Statement of Quality Requirements (form DND 2328 or equivalent) 
attached to the Statement of Requirement, Statement of Work or Technical 
Specifications in Annex ______ to the Contract or otherwise attached to or 
forming part of the Contract, must be completed and made available for 
review by the designated QAA before release of such item and associated 
documents to the Department of National Defence.  Unless otherwise directed 
by the QAA, those documents must be attached to, or enclosed with, the 
shipment they are associated to, in a waterproof envelope.
