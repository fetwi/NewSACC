              of the bid, has been convicted under Section 121 ("<em>Frauds on

              Act</em>; 

       (b)    the Bidder's bidding privileges are suspended or are in the 
              process of being suspended;

       (c)    the bidding privileges of any employee or subcontractor 
              included as part of the bid are suspended or are in the 
              process of being suspended, which suspension or pending 
              suspension would render that employee or subcontractor 
              ineligible to bid on the Work, or the portion of the Work the 
              employee or subcontractor is to perform;

       (d)    with respect to current or prior transactions with Canada

              (i)    the Bidder is bankrupt or if, for whatever reason, its 
                     activities are rendered inoperable for an extended 
                     period;

              (ii)   evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, 
                     fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with 
                     any law protecting individuals against any manner of 
                     discrimination, has been received with respect to the 
                     Bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor 
                     included as part of its bid;

              (iii)  Canada has exercised, or intends to exercise, the 
                     contractual remedy of taking the work out of the 
                     contractor's hands with respect to a contract with the 
                     Bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor 
                     included as part of its bid; or 

              (iv)   Canada determines that the Bidder's performance on 
                     other contracts is sufficiently poor to jeopardize the 
                     successful completion of the requirement being bid on.

3)     In assessing the Bidder's performance on other contracts pursuant to 
       subparagraph 2)(d)(iv)of GI09, Canada may consider, but not be

       (c)    the overall management of the Work and its effect on the 
              level of effort demanded of the department and its 
              representative; and

       (d)    the completeness and effectiveness of the Contractor's safety 
              program during the performance of the Work.

4)     Without limiting the generality of paragraphs 1), 2) and 3) of GI09, 
       Canada may reject any bid based on an unfavourable assessment of the

       (a)    adequacy of the bid price to permit the work to be carried 
              out and, in the case of a bid providing prices per unit, 
              whether each such price reasonably reflects the cost of 
              performing the part of the work to which that price applies; 

       (b)    Bidder's ability to provide the necessary management 
              structure, skilled personnel, experience and equipment to 
              perform competently the work under the Contract; and

       (c)    Bidder's performance on other contracts.

5)     If Canada intends to reject a bid pursuant to a provision of 
       paragraphs 1), 2), 3) or 4) of GI09, other than subparagraph 2)(b) 
       of GI09, Canada shall so inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder 
       ten (10) days within which to make representations, prior to making 
       a final decision on the bid rejection.

6)     Canada may waive informalities and minor irregularities in bids 
       received if Canada determines that the variation of the bid from the 
       exact requirements set out in the Bid Documents can be corrected or 
       waived without being prejudicial to other Bidders.

       in writing by the Contracting Officer at least ten (10) calendar

       timeliness of completion of the work; project management, contract 
       management and management of health and safety. Should the 
       Contractor's performance be considered unsatisfactory, the 
       Contractor's bidding privileges on future work may be suspended 
       indefinitely.

2)     The form PWGSC-TPSGC 2913, SELECT - Contractor Performance 
       Evaluation Report Form, is used to record the performance.
