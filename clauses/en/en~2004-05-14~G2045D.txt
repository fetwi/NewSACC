<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>The Director's and Officer's Liability Insurance provides important financial 
protection to the Contractor, and is applicable in long-term contracting for 
management and similar services, with organizations whose governance comprises 
both profit or non-profit Board of Directors.  Qualifying criteria include 
review of indemnity provisions provided by the organization to their Board.

If either the contracting officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $1,000,000 per loss is not sufficient, alternate 
limits may be established in consultation with the client and the Risk 
Management and Insurance Advisor, Public Works and Government Services Canada 
(NCR RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca).

Refer to G2015D for important additional endorsements that may apply to specific 
contracting areas.
