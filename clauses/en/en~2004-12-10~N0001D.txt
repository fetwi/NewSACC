<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause when limiting a Contractor's liability to the Crown and 
remaining silent on Contractor's liability for third party claims.  Typically, 
this clause would be used in conjunction with the commodity groupings, (other 
than Information Management or Information Technology which has its own clause) 
or after a risk assessment has been performed to determine the risk exposure and 
amount of protection required by the Crown.

Limiting a Contractor's liability should be an exception to the normal practice 
of using the standard terms and conditions.  When the decision is made to limit 
a contractor's liability to the Crown, contracting officers, in conjunction with 
client departments, must be able to demonstrate that the risks associated with 
the procurement have been analyzed and that the limitation of liability provides 
adequate protection to the Crown.  Decisions with respect to limiting a 
Contractor's liability should be made prior to the Request for Proposal release 
or in instances of sole source contracts, prior to the start of negotiations.
