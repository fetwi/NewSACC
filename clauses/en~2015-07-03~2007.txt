<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks – Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
<strong>
   March 11, 2016:
  </strong>
  This version of the clause replaces the 2007,
  
   Standard Instructions - Goods or Services – Non-competitive Requirements
  
  , issued and dated 2015-07-03.
 </p>
<p>
  As part of the
  <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">
   SACC
  </abbr>
  release 2015-3 dated July 3, 2015, the Standard Instructions 2007 were updated to reflect changes to Section 01 Integrity Provisions – Bid. It has since been discovered that the content of the clause was mistakenly replaced with the content of the 2006 Standard Instructions – Request for Standing Offers – Goods or Services – Competitive Requirements clause. Therefore, clause 2007 is updated to correct its content to include the appropriate sections for non-competitive requirements.
 </p>
<p>
  The effective date of the clause remains 2015-07-03 for consistency with the French version of the clause which does not require any corrections.

<h2 id="2015-07-032007general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>
The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated expenditure specified in a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) are only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> does not commit PWGSC to authorize the utilization of a standing offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods, services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or several call-ups against a standing offer.
