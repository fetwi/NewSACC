<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use the following clause in contracts when the contractor must create a database 
containing personal information on employees or third parties.  This clause 
should not be used routinely, but may be appropriate where there are concerns 
about the protection of sensitive information (either for security or privacy 
reasons), particularly where there are concerns about foreign legislation giving 
other governments or third parties rights to access this information without 
Canada's consent.
 </p>
<p>
  Contracting officers must consult with Legal Services before including this 
clause and, when the clause is used, if there are any requests from a bidder or 
contractor to store data outside of Canada.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must ensure that all the databases
containing any information related to the Work are located in
Canada or, if the Contracting Authority has first consented in
writing, in another country where:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">equivalent protections are given to personal
information as in Canada under legislation such as the
<cite>Privacy Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr> 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr>P-21, and the
<cite>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 2000, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr>5, and under any applicable policies of
the Government of Canada; and</li>
<li value="2">the laws do not allow the government of that country
or any other entity or person to seek or obtain the right to view
or copy any information relating to the Contract without first
obtaining the Contracting Authority's written consent.</li>
</ol>
In connection with giving its consent to locating a database in
another country, the Contracting Authority may, at its option,
require the Contractor to provide a legal opinion (from a lawyer
qualified in the foreign country) that the laws in that country
meet the above requirements, or may require the Contractor to pay
for Canada to obtain such a legal opinion. Canada has the right to
reject any request to store Canada's data in a country other than
Canada if there is any reason to be concerned about the security,
privacy, or integrity of Canada's data. Canada may also require
that any data sent or processed outside of Canada be encrypted with
Canada-approved cryptography and that the private key required to
decrypt the data be kept in Canada in accordance with key
management and storage processes approved by Canada.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor must control access to all databases
on which any data relating to the Contract is stored so that only
individuals with the appropriate security clearance are able to
access the database, either by using a password or other form of
access control (such as biometric controls).</li>
<li value="3">The Contractor must ensure that all databases on
which any data relating to the Contract is stored are physically
and logically independent (meaning there is no direct or indirect
connection of any kind) from all other databases, unless those
databases are located in Canada (or in an another country approved
by the Contracting authority under subsection 1) and otherwise meet
the requirements of this article.</li>
<li value="4">The Contractor must ensure that all data relating to
the Contract is processed only in Canada or in another country
approved by the Contracting Authority under subsection 1.</li>
<li value="5">The Contractor must ensure that all domestic network
traffic (meaning traffic or transmissions initiated in one part of
Canada to a destination or individual located in another part of
Canada) is routed exclusively through Canada, unless the
Contracting Authority has first consented in writing to an
alternate route. The Contracting Authority will only consider
requests to route domestic traffic through another country that
meets the requirements of subsection 1.</li>
<li value="6">Despite any section of the General Conditions
relating to subcontracting, the Contractor must not subcontract
(including to an affiliate) any function that involves providing a
subcontractor with access to any data relating to the Contract
unless the Contracting Authority first consents in writing.</li>
