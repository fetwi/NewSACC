<strong>FEDERAL CONTRACTORS PROGRAM FOR EMPLOYMENT EQUITY</strong>

1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) 
       requires that some organizations making proposals for federal 
       government contracts, valued at $200,000 or more (including all 
       applicable taxes), make a formal commitment to implement employment 
       equity, as a condition precedent to the contract award.  If the 
       Proponent is subject to the Program, evidence of its commitment must 
       be provided prior to the award of any contract.

<strong>       </strong>Proponents that have been declared "Ineligible Proponents" by 
       Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (HRSD) are no 
       longer eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold 
       for solicitation of bids as set out in the <em>Government Contract 
       Regulations</em> (currently at $25,000, including all applicable taxes), 
       either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRSD, or 
       following their voluntary withdrawal from the Program for a reason 
       other than the reduction in their workforce.  Any proposal from 
       ineligible proponents will not be considered for award.

2.     The Proponent certifies its status with FCP-EE, as follows: 
       The Proponent 

       (a)    (    )        is not subject to FCP-EE, having a workforce of 
                     less than 100 permanent full or part-time employees in 
                     Canada,

       (b)    (    )        is not subject to FCP-EE, being a regulated 
                     employer under the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>;

       (c)    (    )        is subject to the requirements of FCP-EE, 
                     having a workforce of 100 or more permanent full or 
                     part-time employees in Canada, but has not previously 
                     obtained a certificate number from HRSD, (having not 
                     submitted proposals on requirements of $200,000 or 
                     more), in which case a duly signed certificate of 
                     commitment is provided herewith (attached);

       (d)    (    )        is subject to FCP-EE, and has a valid 
                     certification number as follows: _______ (e.g. has not 
                     been declared "Ineligible Proponent" by HRSD).

3.     If the Proponent does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 2. 
       (a) or (b), the Program requirements do apply, and as such, the 
       Proponent is required to submit HRSD form LAB 1168, Certificate of 
       Commitment to Implement Employment Equity, DULY SIGNED, or a valid 
       Certificate number confirming its adherence to the FCP-EE.

4.     The Proponent acknowledges that the Minister shall rely on this 
       certification to award the Contract.  Should a verification by the 
       Minister disclose a misrepresentation on the part of the Proponent, 
       the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting 
       from this proposal as being in default, and to terminate it pursuant 
       to the Default provisions of the Contract.

5.     In all cases, the Proponent is required to produce evidence or 
       supporting information on demand prior to contract award, if such 
       evidence is not included with its proposal.

<strong>NOTE:  </strong><em>Information on the FCP-EE and the Certificate of Commitment (LAB 
       1168), are available on the following HRSD Website: </em><strong><em class="wsStyleUnderline">http://info.load-otea.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/
