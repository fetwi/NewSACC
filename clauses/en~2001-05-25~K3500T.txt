Appendix _____


<strong class="wsStyleUnderline">CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT</strong><strong class="wsStyleUnderline"></strong>

TO:  HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA ("CANADA"), AS REPRESENTED BY 
THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES ("MINISTER")

[<strong class="wsStyleUnderline">Name</strong>] (the "Bidder") agrees that the documentation available as part of 
the bid solicitation package or in the reading room (the "Documentation") 
for review by a bidder in order for a bidder to submit a bid to the 
Minister in response to Solicitation No. ______ contains information that 
is confidential or proprietary to Canada or to third parties, and that such 
information is not to be disclosed or used in any way other than as set out 
below.

In consideration of the Minister disclosing the Documentation to the Bidder, 
the Bidder agrees that:

       (a)    it shall not, without the prior written permission of the 
              Minister, disclose to anyone, other than an employee or a 
              proposed subcontractor with a need to know, the Documentation 
              or any information contained in the Documentation;

       (b)    it shall not make copies of the Documentation nor make use of 
              the Documentation or any information therein for any purpose 
              other than for the preparation of a bid in response to 
              Solicitation No. _________________;

       (c)    at the close or earlier termination of the bid period, it 
              will immediately deliver the Documentation to the Minister 
              together with every copy of the Documentation and every draft, 
              working paper and note that contains any information 
              contained in the Documentation.

The Bidder<strong> </strong>shall require any proposed subcontractor referred to in (a) 
above to execute a confidentiality agreement on the same terms and 
conditions as those contained herein.

The Bidder acknowledges and agrees that it shall be liable for any and all 
claims, loss, damages, costs, or expenses incurred or suffered by Canada or 
the Minister caused by the failure of the Bidder, or by anyone to whom the 
Bidder discloses the Documentation or any information therein, to comply 
with these terms and conditions.

Nothing in this Confidentiality Agreement shall be construed as limiting 
the Bidder's right to disclose any information to the extent that such 
information:

       (a)    is or becomes in the public domain through no fault of the 
              Bidder or any proposed subcontractor;

       (b)    is or becomes known to the Bidder from a source other than 
              Canada, except any source that is known to the Bidder to be 
              under an obligation to Canada not to disclose the information;

       (c)    is independently developed by the Bidder; or

       (d)    is disclosed under compulsion of a legislative requirement or 
              any order of a court or other tribunal having jurisdiction.
