<pre>Use the following clause in all competitive bid solicitations in which the 
special procedures under the CKTEA are applicable (see Supply Manual) and where 
competition is being conditionally limited to bids offering Canadian and/or 
Korean Goods and Services.  This clause is to be used for single item 
requirements and multi-item requirements that are being certified on an 
aggregate basis. 

This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K5000D, CKTEA Definitions.
</pre>

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     This procurement is subject to a preference for Canadian and/or 
       Korean Goods and Services as defined in clause K5000D, CKTEA 
       Definitions.

2.     Bids that include this representation and warranty will be given 
       preference over other bids, if there are two or more bids with a 
       valid certification.

3.     By executing this representation and warranty, the Bidder Represents 
       and warrants that, of the goods and services being offered, no less 
       than 60 percent of the bid price consists of Canadian and/or Korean 
       Goods and Services, as defined in the clause K5000D, CKTEA 
       Definitions.

4.     The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate bids and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this bid. Such representation and warranty 
       of Canadian and/or Korean content may be verified in such manner as 
       the Minister may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by the Minister disclose a breach of such 
       covenant, the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract 
       resulting from this bid as being in default.

6.     If a Bidder is unable to verify the origin of Goods or Services 
       offered in the bid, then the bid will be considered non-responsive.

7.     Failure to execute this representation and warranty on the signature 
       block immediately following this paragraph and to include it with 
       the bid will result in the Goods and Services offered being treated 
       as non-Canadian and/or non-Korean.
