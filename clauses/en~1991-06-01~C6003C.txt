   unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Minister. The Contractor 
   shall not be obliged to perform any work which would cause the total 
   liability of Canada to exceed the said sum, unless an increase is so 
   authorized.  If at any time the Contractor considers that the cost to 
   Canada under this Contract will exceed 75 percent of the said sum, the 
   Contractor shall notify the Minister to that effect and, if the said sum 
   is considered inadequate to complete the Work, the Contractor shall give 
   the Minister a new estimate of the total cost of the Work.  The giving 
   of such notification and estimate shall not increase Canada's liability 
   over the said sum.
