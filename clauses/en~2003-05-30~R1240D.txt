1.     The Minister may take all or any part of the Services out of the 
       Consultant's hands and may employ reasonable means necessary to 
       complete such Services in the event that:

       (a)    the Consultant has become insolvent or has committed an act 
              of bankruptcy, and has neither made a proposal to the 
              Consultant's creditors nor filed a notice of intention to 
              make such a proposal, pursuant to the <em>Bankruptcy and 
              Insolvency Act</em>, or 

       (b)    the Consultant fails to perform any of the Consultant's 
              obligations under the Agreement or, in the Minister's opinion, 
              so fails to make progress as to endanger performance of the 
              Agreement, in accordance with its terms.

2.     If the Consultant has become insolvent or has committed an act of 
       bankruptcy, and has either made a proposal to the Consultant's 
       creditors or filed a notice of intention to make such a proposal, 
       pursuant to the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, the Consultant shall 
       immediately forward a copy of the proposal or the notice of 
       intention to the Consulting Authority.

3.     Before the Services or any part thereof are taken out of the 
       Consultant's hands under paragraph  1.(b), the Departmental 
       Representative shall provide notice to the Consultant, and may 
       require such failure of performance or progress to be corrected. If 
       within fourteen (14) days after receipt of such notice such default 
       shall not have been corrected or corrective action initiated to 
       correct such fault, the Minister may, by notice, without limiting 
       any other right or remedy, take all or any part of the Services out 
       of the Consultant's hands.

4.     If the Services or any part thereof have been taken out of the 
       Consultant's hands, the Consultant shall be liable for, and upon 
       demand pay to Canada, an amount equal to all loss and damage 
       suffered by Canada by reason of the non-completion of the Services 
       by the Consultant.

5.     If the Consultant fails to pay on demand for the loss or damage as a 
       result of subsection 4, Canada shall be entitled to deduct and 
       withhold the same from any payments due and payable to the 
       Consultant.

6.     The taking of the Services, or any part thereof, out of the 
       Consultant's hands does not relieve or discharge the Consultant from 
       any obligation under the Agreement, or imposed upon the Consultant 
       by law, in respect to the Services or any part thereof that the 
       Consultant has performed.

<strong>GC 7.2 (30/05/03)    Suspension</strong>

1.     The Departmental Representative, with the authority of the Minister, 
       may require the Consultant to suspend the Services being provided, 
       or any part thereof, for a specified or unspecified period.

2.     If a period of suspension does not exceed sixty (60) days and when 
       taken together with other periods of suspension does not exceed 
       ninety (90) days, the Consultant shall, upon the expiration of that 
       period, resume the performance of the Services in accordance with 
       the terms of the Agreement, subject to any agreed adjustment of the 
       time schedule as referred to in GC 3.4.

3.     If a period of suspension exceeds sixty (60) days or when taken 
       together with other periods of suspension, the total exceeds ninety 
       (90) days, and:

       (a)    the Departmental Representative and the Consultant agree that 
              the performance of the Services shall be continued, then the 
              Consultant shall resume performance of the Services, subject 
              to any terms and conditions agreed upon by the Departmental 
              Representative and the Consultant, or

       (b)    the Departmental Representative and the Consultant do not 
              agree that the performance of the Services shall be continued, 
              then the Agreement shall be terminated by notice given by the 
              Minister to the Consultant, in accordance with the terms of 
              GC 7.3.

4.     Suspension costs related to this clause are as outlined in GC 5.10.
 
<strong>GC 7.3 (30/05/03)    Termination</strong>

The Minister may terminate the Agreement at any time, and the fees paid to 
the Consultant shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions in GC 5.11.
