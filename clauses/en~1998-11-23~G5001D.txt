<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause in all ship repair (including emergencies) and 
conversion Contractual documents except where: (1) a general contractor (e.g., 
welding specialist) is expected to perform casual and intermittent work on 
vessels owned by Canada, in addition to its more usual land-based type of work; 
or, (2) a standing offer.

If either the procurement officer or the client believes that the suggested 
MINIMUM LIMIT of liability of $5,000,000 per accident or occurrence is not 
sufficient, the suggested limit should be established in consultation with the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services' Risk Management and 
Insurance Advisor.

When this clause is used, include clause G2010D, Commercial General Liability 
Insurance, in the contractual documents.
