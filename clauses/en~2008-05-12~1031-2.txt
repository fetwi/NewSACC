<h2>1031-2 01 (2008-05-12) General Principle</h2>
<p>The total cost of the Contract must be the sum of the applicable
direct and indirect costs which are, or must be reasonably and
properly incurred and/or allocated, in the performance of the
Contract, less any applicable credits. These costs must be
determined in accordance with the Contractor's cost accounting
practices as accepted by Canada and applied consistently over
time.</p>
<h2>1031-2 02 (2008-05-12) Definition of a Reasonable Cost</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A cost is reasonable if the nature and amount do not
exceed what would be incurred by an ordinary prudent person in the
conduct of a competitive business.</li>
<li value="2">In determining the reasonableness of a particular
cost, consideration will be given to:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as
normal and necessary for the conduct of a contractor's business or
performance of the Contract;</li>
<li value="2">the restraints and requirements by such factors as
generally accepted sound business practices, arm's length
bargaining, federal, provincial and local laws and regulations, and
contract conditions;</li>
<li value="3">the action that prudent business persons would take
in the circumstances, considering their responsibilities to the
owners of the business, their employees, customers, the Government
and public at large;</li>
<li value="4">significant deviations from the established practices
of the Contractor which may unjustifiably increase the contract
costs; and</li>
<li value="5">the specifications, delivery schedule and quality
requirements of the particular contract as they affect costs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>1031-2 03 (2008-05-12) Direct Costs</h2>
<p>There are three categories of direct costs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1"><dfn>"Direct Material Costs"</dfn> meaning the cost of materials
which can be specifically identified and measured as having been
used or to be used in the performance of the Contract and which are
so identified and measured consistently by the Contractor's cost
accounting practices as accepted by Canada.
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">These materials may include, in addition to materials
purchased solely for the performance of the Contract and processed
by the Contractor, or obtained from subcontractors, any other
materials issued from the Contractor's general stocks.</li>
<li value="2">Materials purchased solely for the performance of the
Contract or subcontracts must be charged to the Contract at the net
laid-down cost to the Contractor before cash discounts for prompt
payment.</li>
<li value="3">Materials issued from the Contractor's general stocks must
be charged to the Contract in accordance with the method as used
consistently by the Contractor in pricing material inventories.</li>
</ol></li>
<li value="2"><dfn>"Direct Labour Costs"</dfn> meaning the costs of the
portion of gross wages or salaries incurred for the Work, which can
be specifically identified and measured as having been incurred or
to be incurred in the performance of the Contract and which are so
identified and measured consistently by the Contractor's cost
accounting practices as accepted by Canada.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>"Other Direct Costs"</dfn> meaning those applicable costs,
not falling within the categories of direct material or direct
labour, but which can be specifically identified and measured as
having been incurred or to be incurred in the performance of the
Contract and which are so identified and measured consistently by
the Contractor's cost practices as accepted by Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1031-2 04 (2008-05-12) Indirect Costs</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1"><dfn>"Indirect Costs" (overhead)"</dfn> meaning those costs which, though
necessarily having been incurred during the performance of the
Contract for the conduct of the Contractor's business in general,
cannot be identified and measured as directly applicable to the
performance of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">These Indirect Costs may include, but are not
necessarily restricted to, such items as:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">indirect materials and supplies <a href="#2008-05-121031-21031-2_04_footnote-1">(*)</a>;</li>
<li value="2">indirect labour;</li>
<li value="3">fringe benefits (the Contractor's contribution
only);</li>
<li value="4">public services expenses: expenses of a general
nature such as power, heat, light, operation and maintenance of
general assets and facilities;</li>
<li value="5">fixed/period charges: recurring charges such as
property taxes, rentals and reasonable depreciation costs;</li>
<li value="6">general and administrative expenses: including
remuneration of executive and corporate officers, office wages and
salaries and expenses such as stationery, office supplies, postage
and other necessary administration and management expenses;</li>
<li value="7">selling and marketing expenses associated with the
goods, services or both being acquired under the Contract;</li>
<li value="8">general research and development expenses as
considered applicable by Canada.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="1031-2_04_footnote-1">(*)</a> For supplies of similar low-value, high-usage items the
costs of which meet the above definition of Direct Material Costs
but for which it is economically expensive to account for these
costs in the manner prescribed for direct costs, then they may be
considered to be indirect costs for the purposes of the
Contract.</p>
<h2>1031-2 05 (2008-05-12) Allocation of Indirect Costs</h2>
<p>Indirect Costs must be accumulated in appropriate indirect cost
pools, reflecting a contractor's organizational or operational
lines and these pools subsequently allocated to contracts in
accordance with the following two principles:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the costs included in a particular indirect cost pool
should have a similarity of relationship with each contract to
which that indirect cost pool is subsequently distributed; further,
the costs included in an indirect cost pool should be similar
enough in their relationship to each other that the allocation of
the total costs in the pool provides a result which would be
similar to that achieved if each cost within that pool were
separately distributed;</li>
<li value="2">the allocation basis for each indirect cost pool
should reflect, as far as possible, the causal relationship of the
pooled costs to the contracts to which these costs are
distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1031-2 6 (2008-05-12) Credits</h2>
<p>The applicable portion of any income, rebate, allowance, or any
other credit relating to any applicable direct or indirect cost,
received by or accruing to the Contractor, must be credited to the
Contract.</p>
<h2>1031-2 07 (2008-05-12) Non-applicable Costs</h2>
<p>Despite that the following costs may have been or may be
reasonably and properly incurred by the Contractor in the
performance of the Contract, they are considered non-applicable
costs to the Contract:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">allowance for interest on invested capital, bonds,
debentures, bank or other loans together with related bond
discounts and finance charges;</li>
<li value="2">legal, accounting and consulting fees in connection
with financial reorganization, security issues, capital stock
issues, obtaining of patents and licenses and prosecution of claims
against Canada;</li>
<li value="3">losses on investments, bad debts and collection
charges;</li>
<li value="4">losses on other contracts;</li>
<li value="5">federal and provincial income taxes, excess profit
taxes or surtaxes and/or special expenses in connection with those
taxes;</li>
<li value="6">provisions for contingencies;</li>
<li value="7">premiums for life insurance on the lives of officers
and/or directors where proceeds accrue to the Contractor;</li>
<li value="8">amortization of unrealized appreciation of
assets;</li>
<li value="9">depreciation of assets paid for by Canada;</li>
<li value="10">fines and penalties;</li>
<li value="11">expenses and depreciation of excess facilities;</li>
<li value="12">unreasonable compensation for officers and
employees;</li>
<li value="13">product development or improvement expenses not
associated with the product being acquired under the Contract;</li>
<li value="14">advertising, except reasonable advertising of an
industrial or institutional character placed in trade, technical or
professional journals for the dissemination of information for the
industry or institution;</li>
<li value="15">entertainment expenses;</li>
<li value="16">donations except those to charities registered under
the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>;</li>
<li value="17">dues and other memberships other than regular trade
and professional associations;</li>
<li value="18">fees, extraordinary or abnormal for professional
advice in regard to technical, administrative or accounting
matters, unless approval from the Contracting Authority is
obtained.</li>
