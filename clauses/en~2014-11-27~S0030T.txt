<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use the following clause in requests for supply arrangements when a financial 
opinion is required. If the required information must be received either before 
or after the number of days indicated in the clause, the supply arrangement 
authority may modify the clause accordingly.
 </p>
<p>
  Supply arrangement authorities must consult with the Cost and Price Analysis 
Group of the Policy, Risk, Integrity and Strategic Management Sector, during the 
evaluation of arrangements to determine what financial information may be 
required from the supplier(s).
 </p>
<p>
  Supply arrangement authorities should note that since the statement of work or 
requirement cannot be adequately defined in advance, only a preliminary review 
of the supplier's financial viability will be conducted for the sole purpose of 
pre-qualifying suppliers for supply arrangements. A complete review of the 
bidder's financial capability may be required for subsequent requirements issued 
under the supply arrangement, therefore, supply arrangement authorities must 
include clause
  
   A9033T
  
  in all bid solicitation documents.
