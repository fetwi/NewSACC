<pre>1. Payment by Her Majesty for the work shall be made within thirty (30) 
days following the date on which an invoice and substantiating 
documentation are received according to the terms of the Contract. 

2. If Her Majesty has any objection to the form of the invoice or the 
   substantiating documentation, within fifteen (15) days of its receipt 
   She shall notify the Contractor of the nature of the objection. "Form of 
   the invoice" means an invoice which contains or is accompanied by such 
   substantiating documentation as Her Majesty requires. Failure by Her 
   Majesty to act within 15 days will only result in the date specified in 
   paragraph 1 of the clause to apply for the sole purpose of calculating 
   interest on overdue accounts.
