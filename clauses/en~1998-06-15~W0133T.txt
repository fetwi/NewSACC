Banks Island</cite>, clauses:</p>
<ul class="hierarchy">
<li><span class="number">8.04</span> Qualified Inuvialuit
businesses, particularly those in Sachs Harbour, shall be given
first consideration where a Government Contract related to the park
may, in accordance with the Government Contracts Regulations, be
awarded without competition.</li>
<li><span class="number">8.06</span> Prior to inviting bids by
public notice for Government Contracts related to the park, Canada
shall solicit bids from suppliers of goods and services, firstly
from within the community of Sachs Harbour and secondly from within
the Western Arctic Region. When soliciting bids:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Canada shall make all possible attempts to award
contracts to qualified Inuvialuit businesses according to the
measures outlined in this Article;</li>
<li value="2">Canada shall take all reasonable measures to
determine if there are Inuvialuit businesses, particularly
Inuvialuit businesses located in Sachs Harbour, qualified to
perform the contracts. This determination will usually be made by
reference to the list of Inuvialuit businesses provided by the
Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) and the Sachs Harbour
Community Corporation (SHCC);</li>
<li value="3">Where it is determined that a single business within
the Western Arctic Region is qualified to perform a particular
contract, Canada shall solicit that business to submit a bid for
that contract. The contract may be awarded upon the negotiation of
acceptable terms and conditions;</li>
<li value="4">Where Canada intends to solicit bids from more than
one qualified business within the Western Arctic Region, Canada
shall take all reasonable measures to determine if there are
Inuvialuit businesses qualified to perform the contract, and shall
solicit bids from those Inuvialuit businesses. This determination
will usually be made by reference to the list of Inuvialuit
businesses provided by the <abbr title="Inuvialuit Regional Corporation">IRC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Statutes of Canada ">SHCC</abbr>. The contract, if
awarded, shall take into account the bid evaluation criteria

provisions of (c) or (d) above, Canada shall ensure that the
contract document contains appropriate terms and conditions to
ensure that sub-contractors are also subject to the intent and
specific provisions of the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where, after considering known available suppliers including
those on the list of Inuvialuit businesses, it is determined that
there are no qualified suppliers or where bid solicitation is
inconsistent with laws of general application, Canada may proceed
directly to bid invitation as set out it 8.07.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="number">8.07</span> Canada may invite bids,
firstly from within the community of Sachs Harbour and secondly

<li value="1">Canada shall take all reasonable measures to inform
Inuvialuit businesses of such bid invitations and to provide

submit bids, notwithstanding that one or more such businesses may
have submitted bids as part of the solicitation process. These
measures will include the measures referred to in 8.03 above;</li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to invite bids for Government
Contracts related to the Park, the bid invitation process shall
take into account the bid evaluation criteria contained in 8.05;
and</li>
