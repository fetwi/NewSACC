<pre>The estimated amount of profit included in the Contractor's price or rate 
certification is subject to audit by Canada, before or after payment is 
made to the Contractor under the conditions of the Contract.  The purpose 
of the audit would be to determine whether the actual profit earned on a 
single contract if only one exists, or the aggregate of actual profit 
earned by the Contractor on a series of negotiated firm price and 
fixed-time rate contracts performed during a particular period selected, is 
fair and reasonable based on the estimated amount of profit included in 
earlier price or rate certification(s).

If the audit demonstrates that the actual profit is not fair and reasonable, 
as defined above, the Contractor must repay Canada the amount found to be 
in excess.
