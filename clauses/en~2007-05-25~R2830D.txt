5)     The Contractor shall have sole responsibility for the design, 
       erection, operation, maintenance and removal of temporary structures

       in their erection, operation, maintenance and removal.  The 
       Contractor shall engage and pay for registered professional 
       engineering personnel, skilled in the appropriate discipline to 
       perform these functions if required by law or by the Contract, and 
       in all cases when such temporary facilities and their methods of

       and is suitable for the intended purpose, Canada may approve the 
       substitution, subject to the following:

       (a)    the request for substitution shall be made in writing to 
              Canada and shall be substantiated by information in the form 
              of the manufacturer's literature, samples and other data that 
              may be required by Canada;

       (b)    the Contractor shall make the request for substitution in a 
              manner that shall not negatively affect the progress schedule 
              of the Contract and well in advance of the time the item of 
              Material must be ordered; 

       (c)    substitution of Material shall be permitted only with the 
              prior written approval of Canada, and any substituted items 
              that are supplied or installed without such approval shall be 
              removed from the site of the Work at the expense of the

              expenses incurred by Canada, the Contractor, its 
              subcontractors and suppliers at any tier due to the 
              Contractor's use of the substitute.

<strong>GC3.6  (2007-05-25)  Subcontracting</strong>

       intention to subcontract. 
3)     A notification referred to in paragraph 2) of GC3.6 shall identify 
       the part of the Work and the Subcontractor with whom the Contractor 
       intends to subcontract.

4)     Canada may for reasonable cause, object to the intended 
       subcontracting by notifying the Contractor in writing within sixÂ (6) 
       days of receipt by Canada of a notification referred to in paragraph

       enter into the intended subcontract.

       Subcontractor engaged by the Contractor, in accordance with this 
       clause, without the written consent of Canada.

       Contract that are of general application shall be incorporated in 
       every other contract issued as a consequence of the Contract, at 
       whatever tier, except those contracts issued solely to suppliers at 
       any tier for the supply of Plant or Material.

8)     Neither a subcontracting nor Canada's consent to a subcontracting 
       shall be construed to relieve the Contractor from any obligation 
       under the Contract or to impose any liability upon Canada.

<strong>GC3.7  (2007-05-25)  Construction by Other Contractors or Workers</strong>

1)     Canada reserves the right to send other contractors or workers, with 
       or without Plant and Material, onto the site of the Work.

2)     When other contractors or workers are sent on to the site of the

              are compatible with the conditions of the Contract;

       (b)    ensure that the insurance coverage provided by the other

              the Contractor as it affects the Work; and 

       (c)    take all reasonable precautions to avoid labour disputes or 
              other disputes arising from the work of the other contractors

       (d)    where part of the Work is affected by or depends upon the 
              work of other contractors or workers for its proper execution, 
              promptly report to Canada in writing and prior to proceeding 
              with that part of the Work, any apparent deficiencies in such 
              work.  Failure by the Contractor to so report shall 
              invalidate any claims against Canada by reason of the 
              deficiencies in the work of other contractors or workers 
              except those deficiencies that are not then reasonably 
              discoverable; and

       (e)    when designated as the constructor in accordance with the 
              applicable provincial or territorial laws, carry out its 
              duties in that role and in accordance with those laws.

4)     If, when entering into the Contract, the Contractor could not have 
       reasonably foreseen nor anticipated the sending of other contractors 
       or workers on to the site of the Work and provided the Contractor

       (a)    incurs extra expense in complying with the requirements of 
              paragraph 3) of GC3.7; and

       (b)    gives Canada written notice of a claim for that extra expense 
              within thirty (30) days of the date that the other 
              contractors or workers were sent onto the Work or its site; 

       Canada shall pay the Contractor the cost of the extra labour, Plant 
       and Material that was necessarily incurred, calculated in accordance 
       with GC6.4, "Determination of Price".

       persons who have been on active service with the Armed Forces of 
       Canada and have been honourably discharged therefrom.

       Material and Plant and the interest of the Contractor in all real 
       property, licences, powers and privileges purchased, used or 
       consumed by the Contractor for the Work shall, immediately after the 
       time of their purchase, use or consumption be the property of Canada 
       for the purposes of the Work and they shall continue to be the

       (b)    in the case of Plant, real property, licences, powers and 
              privileges, until Canada indicates that the interest vested

              the Work.

2)     Material or Plant, that is the property of Canada by virtue of

1)     The Contractor shall promptly remove from the site of the Work and 
       replace or re-execute defective Work whether or not the defective

       damage through carelessness or other act or omission of the 
       Contractor.

2)     The Contractor, at the Contractor's expense, shall promptly make 
       good other work destroyed or damaged by such removals or

       that called for by the contract documents.

4)     The failure of Canada to reject any defective Work or Material shall 
       not constitute acceptance of the defective Work or Material.

       servants, or by other contractors and workers referred to in GC3.7, 
       "Construction by Other Contractors or Workers".
