<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Definition. "<dfn>Supplies</dfn>" as used in this clause,
includes but is not limited to raw materials, requirements,
intermediate assemblies and end products.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor shall provide and maintain an
inspection system acceptable to the Canadian Commercial Corporation
(CCC) covering supplies under this Contract and shall tender for
acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance
with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to
be in conformity with Contract requirements. As part of the system,
the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections
made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept
complete and made available to <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> during Contract performance and
for as long afterwards as the Contract requires. <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may perform
reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain
compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall
be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the Contract
Work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not
relieve the Contractor of its obligations under the Contract.</li>
<li value="3"><abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> has the right to inspect and test all supplies
called for by the Contract, to the extent practicable, at all
places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any
event before acceptance. <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> shall perform inspections and tests in
a manner that will not unduly delay the Work. <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> assumes no
contractual obligation to perform any inspection or test for the
benefit of the Contractor, unless specifically set forth elsewhere
in this Contract.</li>
<li value="4">If <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> performs an inspection or a test on the
premises of the Contractor or a subContractor, the Contractor shall
furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, without
additional charge, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the
safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as
otherwise provided in the Contract, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> shall bear the expense of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or
subcontractor's premises; provided, that in a case of rejection, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of
inspection or test samples.</li>
<li value="5">
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">When supplies are not ready at the time specified
by the Contractor for inspection or test, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may charge to the
Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</li>
<li value="2">CCC may also charge the Contractor for any additional
cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection
or retest necessary.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="6"><abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> has the right either to reject or to require
correction of non-conforming supplies. Supplies are non-conforming
when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise
not in conformity with Contract requirements. <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may reject
non-conforming supplies with or without disposition
instructions.</li>
<li value="7">The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or
required to be corrected. However, the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government may require
or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the
expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for
acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the
former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required,
shall disclose the corrective action taken.</li>
<li value="8">If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace,
or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to
be replaced or corrected, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may either (1) by Contract or
otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the
cost to the Contractor, or (2) terminate the Contract for default.
Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the
delivery schedule, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may require their delivery and make an
equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction
shall be a dispute.</li>
<li value="9">
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If this Contract provides for the performance of
the Canadian Government quality assurance at source, and if
requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance
notification of the time
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">when Contractor inspection or tests will be performed
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract;
and</li>
<li value="2">when the supplies will be ready for Government
inspection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The Government request shall specify the period and
method of the advance notification and the Government
representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not
require more than two (2) workdays of advance notification if the
Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's
plant; no more than seven (7) workdays in other instances.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="10">The <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government shall accept or reject supplies
as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise
provided in the Contract. <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government failure to inspect and
accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from
responsibility nor impose liability on the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government, for
non-conforming supplies.</li>
<li value="11">Inspections and tests by the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government do not
relieve the Contractor of responsibility for the defects or other
failures to meet Contract requirements discovered before
acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent
defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise
provided in the Contract.</li>
<li value="12">If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the
reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, in addition to any other
rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of
the Contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at
no increase in Contract Price, to correct or replace the defective
or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at
the Contractor's plant at <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>'s election, and in accordance within
a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the
Contractor and <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>; provided that <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may require a reduction in
Contract Price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery
schedule, or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the
Contractor of notice of defects or non-conformance, to repay such
portion of the Contract as is equitable under the circumstances if <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies
are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the
transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the
Contractor's plant and return to the original point. If the
Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above
and does not cure such failure within a period of ten (10) days (or
such longer period as <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may authorize in writing) after receipt
of notice from <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> specifying such failure, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> shall have the
right by Contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies
and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> thereby.</li>
