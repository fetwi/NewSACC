<pre><strong>[** PROCUREMENT OFFICERS ARE TO EDIT THE LIST IN PARAGRAPH 3 TO ENSURE THAT 
IT IS CORRECT AT TIME OF CONTRACT AWARD.  DELETE THIS INSTRUCTION PRIOR TO

(1)    From time to time, in compliance with United Nations obligations or 
       other international agreements, Canada imposes restrictions on trade, 
       financial transactions or other dealings with a foreign country or 
       its nationals.  These sanctions may be implemented by regulation 
       under the <em>United Nations Act</em> (UNA), R.S.C. 1985, c. U-2 , the <em>
       Special Economic Measures Act</em> (SEMA), S.C. 1992, c. 17,  or the <em>
       Export and Import Permits Act</em> (EIPA), R.S.C. 1985, c. E-19.  The 
       Contractor agrees that it will, in the performance of the Contract, 
       comply with any such regulations that are in force on the effective 
       date of the Contract, and will require such compliance by its 
       first-tier subcontractors.

(2)    The Contractor agrees that Canada relies on the Contractor's 
       undertaking in subsection (1) to enter into the Contract, and that 
       any breach of the undertaking shall entitle Canada to terminate the 
       Contract under the provisions of the Contract relating to default by 
       the Contractor, and therefore to recover damages from the Contractor, 
       including reprocurement costs arising out of such a termination.

(3)    As of this date, sanctions are in place against the following 
       countries:

              Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro) - UNA, United Nations 
              Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
              Regulations, SOR 92-342 as amended by SOR 93-211 

              Haiti - SEMA, Special Economic Measures (Haiti) Regulations 
              1993, SOR 93-499

              Iraq - UNA, United Nations Iraq Regulations, SOR 90-531 as 
              amended by SOR 90-694, 91-185, and 93-343

              Libya - UNA, United Nations Libya Regulations, SOR 92-222, as 
              amended by SOR 93-521. 

(4)    Canada will use reasonable efforts to make the text of any such 
       regulations available on its electronic bulletin board on a 
       reasonably current basis by way of assistance to the Contractor, but 
       the Contractor agrees that only the text as published in the Canada 
       Gazette, Part II, is authoritative, and the Contractor waives any 
       claim against Canada, the Minister, or their employees or agents for 
       any costs, loss, or damage whatever that results from the 
       Contractor's reliance on the text of a regulation as reproduced on 
       the electronic bulletin board.
