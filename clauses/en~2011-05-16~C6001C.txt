<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
 Use the following clause in all cost reimbursable contracts with a limitation of 
expenditure.

Do not use this clause in firm price or ceiling price contracts.

Use this clause in conjunction with
 
  C0206C
 
 .  When contracts include multiple 
bases of payment, contracting officers must insert the amount in the space below 
that is subject to the Limitation of Expenditure portion of the basis of payment 
only.

Alternatively, use clause
 
  C9010C
 
 for contracts with task authorizations.
