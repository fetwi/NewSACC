<strong>EMPLOYMENT EQUITY</strong>

The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity requires that 
Canadian organizations bidding for federal government contracts, $200,000 
and over, make a formal commitment to implement employment equity, as a 
pre-condition to the validation of their bids.  If the Proponent is subject 
to the Program, evidence of its commitment must be provided prior to the 
award of any contract.

              part-time and/or full time employees across Canada

       (    ) This organization is a federally regulated employer

       If the Proponent does not fall within the parameters of items above, 
       the program requirements do apply and, as such the Proponent is 
       required to submit, prior to the award of any contract, a duly 
       signed Certificate of Commitment as referenced below, or its 
       Certificate number confirming its adherence to the program.
