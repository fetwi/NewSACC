<strong>GI 2   (12/12/03)    Enquiries During the Solicitation Period</strong>

1.     Except for the approval of alternative materials as described in 
       subsection 1 of GI3 all other enquiries regarding the tender must be 
       submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer named on the front 
       cover of the Specifications as early as possible within the 
       tendering period. Enquiries should be received no later than five (5) 
       calendar days prior to the date set for prime tender closing to 
       allow sufficient time to provide a response.  Enquiries received 
       after that time may not result in an answer being provided.

2.     Enquiries concerning this procurement may be raised prior to the 
       date set for prime tender closing with the Contracting Officer in 
       order to obtain general guidance.  The Contracting Officer and the 
       Departmental Representative shall examine the content of the enquiry 
       and shall decide whether or not to issue an addendum to the Tender 
       Documents.

3.     To ensure consistency and quality of the information provided to 
       Tenderers, the Contracting Officer shall provide, simultaneously to 
       all Tenderers to which Tender Documents have been sent, by means of 
       an addendum, any information with respect to significant enquiries 
       received and the replies to such enquiries without revealing the 
       source.

4.     All enquiries and other communications sent throughout the tendering 
       period are to be directed ONLY to the Contracting Officer named on 
       the front cover of the Specifications.  Non-compliance with this 
       requirement during the tendering period can, for that reason alone, 
       result in disqualification of a tender.


<strong>GI 3   (12/12/03)    Approval of Alternative Materials</strong>

When materials are specified by trade names or trademarks, or by 
manufacturers' or suppliers' names, the tender shall be based on use of the 
named materials.  During the tendering period, alternative materials may be 
considered provided full technical data is received in writing by the 
Contracting Authority at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the tender 
closing date.  If the alternative materials are approved for the purposes 
of the tender, an addendum to the tender documents shall be issued.

2.     Subject to GI13, any alteration to the preprinted or pre-typed 
       sections of the Tender and Acceptance form, or any condition or

       Unit Price by the respective Estimated Quantity, insert the answer 
       in the Total Estimated Price column against each Item and add the 
       Total Estimated Price column to obtain the Total Unit Price Amount 
       for the Unit Price portion of the Work.  This Amount is to be 
       inserted at the bottom of the Unit Price Table in TA6 of this form.

       front page of the Invitation to Tender in the space provided.

2.     In order to confirm the authority of the person or persons signing

<strong>GI 7   (14/05/04)    Procurement Business Number</strong>

1.     For procurement purposes, the Government of Canada uses a unique 
       Procurement Business Number (PBN) to identify a company and its 
       branches, divisions, or offices, where appropriate.  The PBN is 
       created using the entity's Canada Revenue Agency Business Number.

2.     All Canadian companies are required to have a PBN prior to contract 
       award in order to receive a PWGSC contract.  Non-Canadian companies 
       are strongly encouraged to obtain a PBN.

3.     Companies may register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration 
       Information service on line at the Contracts Canada Website at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline">http:
       //contractscanada.gc.ca</strong>.

4.     For non-Internet registration, contact the Contracts Canada InfoLine 
       at 1-800-811-1148 or (819) 956-3440, in the National Capital Area, 
       to obtain the telephone number of the nearest Supplier Registration 
       Agent.


<strong>GI 8   (12/12/03)    Submission of  Tender by Facsimile Transmission</strong>

1.     Unless specified elsewhere in the Tender and Contract Documents,

       (a)    submission of a correct and fully completed Tender and 
              Acceptance form and the front page by facsimile transmission 
              is acceptable;

       (b)    for tenders transmitted by facsimile, a paper copy of the 
              Tender and Acceptance form with an original signature on the 
              front page of the Invitation to Tender shall be delivered to 
              the Tender Address as shown on the Front Page  within two (2) 
              working days immediately following the Tender Closing Date 
              and the form should bear the word "CONFIRMATION".

2.     If the Tenderer chooses to submit a tender by facsimile transmission, 
       Canada shall not be responsible for any failure attributable to the 
       transmission or receipt of the facsimile tender including, but not 
       limited to

       (a)    receipt of garbled or incomplete tender;
       (b)    availability or condition of the receiving facsimile

<strong>GI 9   (12/12/03)    Revision of Tenders</strong>

1.     A tender submitted in accordance with these instructions may be 
       revised by letter or facsimile provided the revision is received at 
       the office designated for the receipt of tenders, on or before the 
       date and time set for the closing of tenders.  The letter or 
       facsimile shall

       (a)    be on the Tenderer's letterhead or bear a signature that 
identifies the Tenderer;

       (b)    for the lump sum portion of a tender, clearly identify the 
              amount of the current revision.  The total aggregate sum of 
              all revisions submitted, including the current revision, 
              shall be shown separately; and

       (c)    for the Unit Price portion of a tender, clearly identify the 
              change(s) in the Price(s) per Unit and the specific Item(s) 
              to which each change applies.  If a revision is to be applied 
              to a specific Item that was previously amended then, in 
              addition to the amount of the current revision, the total 
              aggregate sum of all revisions submitted, including the 
              current revision, for that Item shall be shown separately.

2.     A letter or facsimile submitted to confirm an earlier revision shall 
       be clearly identified as "CONFIRMATION ONLY".  If a revision is 
       received and is not so identified then the amount noted therein 
       shall be deducted from or added to the identified Price(s) per Unit 
       or Lump Sum tender amount, whichever is applicable, provide it meets 
       the requirements described in subsection 1 of GI8.

3.     Failure to comply with any of the above provisions shall result in 
       the rejection of the non-compliant revision(s) only.  The tender 
       shall be evaluated based on the original tender submitted and all 
       other compliant revision(s).


<strong>GI 10  (12/12/03)    Acceptance of Tender</strong>

1.     Canada may accept any tender, whether it is the lowest or not, or 
       may reject any and all tenders.

2.     Without limiting the generality of subsection 1 of GI10, Canada may 
       reject any tender, based on an unfavourable assessment as to

       (a)    the adequacy of the tendered price to carry out the work and, 
              in the case of a tender providing Unit Prices, whether each 
              Unit Price reasonably reflects the cost of performing the 
              work related to that Price;

       (b)    whether the Tenderer has the necessary management structure, 
              skilled personnel, experience and equipment to perform 
              competently the work under the Contract; and

       (c)    the Tenderer's performance on other contracts.

3.     In assessing the Tenderer's performance on other contracts pursuant 
       to subsection 2 of GI10, Canada may consider, but not be limited to, 
       such matters as

       (a)    the efficiency and workmanship of the Tenderer in performing 
the work; and

       (b)    the extent to which the Tenderer executed the work in 
              accordance with terms and conditions of the contract.

4.     Canada may reject a tender where any of the following circumstances 
       is present:

       (a)    the Tenderer, or any employee or subcontractor included as 
              part of the tender, has been convicted under section 121 ("
              Frauds on the government" &amp; "Contractor subscribing to 
              election fund"), 124 ("Selling or purchasing office") or 418 
              ("Selling defective stores to Her Majesty") of the <em>Criminal 
              Code</em>; or

       (b)    the Tenderer's tendering privileges have been suspended or 
              are in the process of being suspended;

       (c)    the tendering privileges of an employee or subcontractor 
              included as part of the tender have been suspended or are in 
              the process of being suspended, which suspension or pending 
              suspension would render that employee or subcontractor 
              ineligible to tender on the work, or the portion of the work 
              the employee or subcontractor is to perform;

       (d)    with respect to current or prior transactions with Canada;

              (i)    the Tenderer is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, 
                     its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended 
                     period;

              (ii)   evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, 
                     fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with 
                     any law protecting individuals against any manner of 
                     discrimination, has been received with respect to the 
                     Tenderer, any of its employees or any subcontractor 
                     included as part of its tender;

              (iii)  the Minister has previously exercised or intends to 
                     exercise the contractual remedy of taking the work out 
                     of the contractor's hands with respect to a contract 
                     with the Tenderer, any of its employees or any 
                     subcontractor included as part of its tender; or

              (iv)   Canada determines that the Tenderer's performance on 
                     other contracts is sufficiently poor so as to 
                     jeopardize the successful completion of the work being 
                     tendered upon.
 
5.     Where Canada intends to reject a tender pursuant to the provisions 
       of subsection 4 of GI10, other than paragraph 4. (b), the Minister 
       shall so inform the Tenderer and provide the Tenderer ten (10) 
       calendar days within which to make representations prior to making a 
       final decision on the tender rejection.


<strong>GI 11  Additional Information</strong>

Prior to contract award, the Tenderer submitting the lowest compliant 
tender may be requested by the Departmental Representative to submit 
additional information relating to its tender.  The type of information, 
the amount of detail and the time frame for the provision of such 
information shall be fully described in a written notice.  Failure to 
provide the information as requested shall result in the disqualification 
of the tender.<strong></strong>


<strong>GI 12  Negotiations</strong>

1.     In the event that the lowest compliant tender exceeds the amount of 
       funding Canada has allocated for the construction phase of the work

       (a)    by 15% or less, Canada, at its sole discretion, shall either

              (i)    cancel the tender call; or

              (ii)   obtain additional funding and, subject to the 
                     provisions of GI9, award the Contract to the Tenderer 
                     submitting the lowest compliant tender; or

              (iii)  revise the scope of the work accordingly and negotiate, 
                     with the Tenderer submitting the lowest compliant 
                     tender, a corresponding reduction in its tendered 
                     price.

       (b)    by more than 15%, Canada, at its sole discretion, shall 
either

              (i)    cancel the tender call; or

              (ii)   obtain additional funding and, subject to the 
                     provisions of GI9, award the Contract to the Tenderer 
                     submitting the lowest compliant tender; or

              (iii)  revise the scope of the work accordingly and invite 
                     those who submitted compliant tenders at the original 
                     tender call to re-tender the work.

2.     If negotiations or a re-tender are undertaken as is contemplated in 
       subparagraph 1. (a)(iii) of GI12 or subparagraph 1. (b)(iii) of GI12, 
       Tenderers shall retain the same subcontractors and suppliers as they 
       carried in their original tenders submissions.

3.     If Canada elects to negotiate a reduction in the tendered price as 
       is contemplated in subparagraph 1. (a)(iii) of GI12 and the 
       negotiations fail to reach an agreement, Canada shall then exercise 
       either of the options referred to subparagraph 1. (a)(i) or 1. 
       (a)(ii).


<strong>GI 13  (12/12/03)    Minor Irregularities</strong>

Notwithstanding any other provision contained in these General Instructions 
to Tenderers, Canada may waive minor irregularities in tenders received if 
Canada determines that the variation of the tender from the exact 
requirements set out in the Tender and Contract Documents can be corrected 
or waived without being prejudicial to other Tenderers.


<strong>GI 14  (12/12/03)    Compliance with Applicable Laws</strong>

1.     By submission of this tender, the Tenderer certifies that the 
       Tenderer has the legal capacity to enter into a contract and is in 
       possession of all valid licences, permits, registrations, 
       certificates, declarations, filings, or other authorizations 
       necessary to comply with all federal, provincial and municipal laws 
       and regulations applicable to the submission of the tender and entry 
       into any ensuing contract for the performance of the Work.
