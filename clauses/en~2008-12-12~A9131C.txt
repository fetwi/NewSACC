<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     As the Contract requires production of or access to controlled goods 
       that are subject to the <em>Defence Production Act, </em>R.S. 1985, c. D-1, 
       the Contractor and any subcontractor are advised that, within Canada, 
       only persons who are registered, exempt or excluded under the 
       Controlled Goods Program (CGP) are lawfully entitled to examine, 
       possess or transfer controlled goods.  Details on how to register 
       under the CGP are available at: http://www.cgp.gc.ca<span class="wsStyleUnderline">.</span>

2.     When the Contractor and any subcontractor proposed to examine, 
       possess or transfer controlled goods are not registered, exempt or 
       excluded under the CGP at time of contract award, the Contractor and 
       any subcontractor must, within seven (7) working days from receipt 
       of written notification of the contract award, ensure that the 
       required application(s) for registration or exemption are submitted 
       to the CGP.  No examination, possession or transfer of controlled 
       goods must be performed until the Contractor has provided proof, 
       satisfactory to the Contracting Authority, that the Contractor and 
       any subcontractor are registered, exempt or excluded under the CGP.

       Failure of the Contractor to provide proof, satisfactory to the 
       Contracting Authority, that the Contractor and any subcontractor are 
       registered, exempt or excluded under the CGP, within thirty (30) 
       days from receipt of written notification of contract award, will be 
       considered a default under the Contract except to the extent that 
       Canada is responsible for the failure due to delay in processing the 
       application.

3.     The Contractor and any subcontractor must maintain registration, 
       exemption or exclusion from the CGP for the duration of the Contract 
       and in any event for so long as they will examine, possess or 
       transfer controlled goods.
