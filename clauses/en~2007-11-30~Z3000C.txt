<pre>1.     This is an urgent United States (U.S.) government defence 
       requirement and use of a U.S. Priority Rating is authorized and 
       assigned.  This Priority Rating is valid only for the purchase of 
       materials, sub-assemblies and components by the Contractor directly 
       from U.S. contractors up to a total of US$ _____.  If the Contractor 
       exceeds the dollar limitation, the Contractor is authorized to 
       proceed with the purchase order while providing the Defence 
       Priorities Officer, Public Works and Government Services Canada 
       (PWGSC), with details of the additional amount required, either by 
       e-mail at: <a href="mailto:NCR ACQB DefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">NCR ACQB DefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca</a>, or by facsimile 
       at 819-956-1459.

2.     The assigned U.S. Priority Rating, required delivery date, signature 
       of an individual authorized to sign rated orders, and the following 
       certification must be placed on or attached to the Contractor's 
       purchase order to U.S. contractors:

              "This is a rated order certified for national defense use, 
              and the Contractor is required to follow all the provisions 
              of the U.S. Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems 
              regulation (15 CFR Part 700)."

3.     Assigned U.S. priority ratings may not be extended within Canada. In 
       consequence, when further materials are imported through the 
       Contractor's Canadian subcontractors or distributors, the following 
       paragraph must be added in the purchase order with the Canadian 
       subcontractor:

              "<strong>PRIORITY ASSISTANCE</strong>: This is an urgent defence requirement.  
              If the Contractor is importing any material/service from U.S. 
              for the fulfilment of the Contract, contact the Defence 
              Priorities Officer, PWGSC, to request a U.S. Priority Rating."

4.     The Contractor must keep for a period of three (3) years, and 
       provide to Canada, on request, a record of its authority to use the 
       rating authorization and of all the uses made of it by the 
       Contractor.

5.     Special Priority Assistance:

       If the Contractor needs assistance in obtaining delivery under a 
       delinquent rated order with a U.S. contractor, the Contractor should 
       contact the Defence Priorities Officer, PWGSC.
