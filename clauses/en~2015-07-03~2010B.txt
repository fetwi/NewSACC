bound under the Contract, unless the Contracting Authority requires

of the Contract and require its correction or replacement at the
Contractor's expense.</p>

<h2 id="2015-07-032010Btransportation-carriers-liability">2010B 13 (2010-01-11) Transportation Carriers' Liability</h2>

precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2 id="2015-07-032010Bpayment-period">2010B 14 (2014-09-25) Payment Period</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada's standard payment period is 30 days.
The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31<sup>st</sup> day following that date and interest

<li value="2">If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
15 days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>
