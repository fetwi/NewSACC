1.     Persons and companies in Canada are bound by economic sanctions 
       imposed by Canada by regulations passed pursuant to the <em>United 
       Nations Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. U-2, the <em>Special Economic Measures Act</em>, 
       S.C. 1992, c. 17, or the <em>Export and Import Permits Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, 
       c. E-19. As a result, the Government of Canada cannot accept 
       delivery of goods or services that originate, either directly or 
       indirectly, from the countries subject to economic sanctions. At the 
       time of contract award, the following regulations implement economic 
       sanctions:

       (a)    United Nations Iraq Regulations;
       (b)    United Nations Libya Regulations;
       (c)    United Nations Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
              Montenegro) Regulations.

2.     It is a condition of this Contract that the Contractor not supply to 
       the Government of Canada any goods or services which are subject to 
       economic sanctions as described in paragraph 1. above.

3.     During the performance of the Contract should the addition of a 
       country to the list of sanctioned countries or the additions of a 
       good or service to the list of sanctioned goods or services cause an 
       impossibility of performance for the Contractor, the situation will 
       be treated by the Parties as a force majeure. The Contractor shall 
       forthwith inform Canada of the situation; the procedures applicable 
       to force majeure shall then apply.
