<p>The estimated amount of profit included in the Contractor's
price or rate certification is subject to audit by Canada, before
or after payment is made to the Contractor under the conditions of
the Contract. The purpose of the audit would be to determine
whether the actual profit earned on a single contract if only one
exists, or the aggregate of actual profit earned by the Contractor
on a series of negotiated firm price and fixed-time rate contracts
performed during a particular period selected, is reasonable and
justifiable based on the estimated amount of profit included in
earlier price or rate certification(s).</p>
<p>If the audit demonstrates that the actual profit is not
reasonable and justifiable, as defined above, the Contractor must
repay Canada the amount found to be in excess.</p>
