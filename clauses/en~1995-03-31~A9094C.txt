<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>This clause should be used when a proposed contractor has started work at its 
own risk without the authorization of a government official, prior to contract 
authorization, and the work has not been completed. This will ensure that the 
work done prior to the contract date will be covered by the contract.  If the 
work has been completed, the contracting authority must request that a 
confirming order be prepared by legal counsel. 

The second paragraph is to be deleted if the client department does not wish to 
retain the rights to the intellectual property.  In addition, add clause C0210C 
to the Basis of Payment.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>In order to complete the Work called for by the Contract within the 
delivery requirements set forth herein, it is recognized that the 
Contractor, as of _____ (start date), has incurred certain costs relating 
directly to the performance of this Contract prior to the effective date of 
this Contract, which, if they had been incurred after such date, would have 
been otherwise treated as costs reasonably and properly incurred by the 
Contractor in the performance of this Contract. Inasmuch as the incurring 
of precontractual costs was necessary to comply with the terms of the 
Contract, such costs shall be treated as costs reasonably and properly 
incurred by the Contractor in the performance of this Contract.

The parties hereby confirm that copyright in the Work shall vest and remain
