Note: 	For the French version of the clause, the term "in" was not translated 
because there is no such common term in French for all the provinces and 
territory. Therefore, the word "en" must be added in front of Alberta, 
Colombie-Britannique, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Nouvelle-Écosse; the word "au" 
in front of Manitoba, Québec, Nouveau-Brunswick and Yukon, the word "à" in front 
of Terre-Neuve and l'Ile-du-Prince-Édouard, and the words "dans les" in front of 
Territoires du Nord Ouest.
