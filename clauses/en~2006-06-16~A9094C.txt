<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<pre>Use the following clause when a proposed contractor has started work at its own 
risk without the authorization of a government official, prior to contract 
authorization, and the work has not been completed.  This will ensure that the 
work done before the contract date will be covered by the contract. 

If the work has been completed, the contracting officer must instead request 
that a confirming order be prepared by legal counsel.

The second paragraph is to be deleted if the client department does not wish to 
retain the rights to the intellectual property.

Use this clause in conjunction with C0210C.

<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     In order for the Contractor to meet its obligations under the 
       Contract, the Parties acknowledge that the Contractor has started 
       the Work required pursuant to the Contract before the effective date 
       of the Contract (Pre-contractual Work) and has incurred costs in the 
       performance of such Work.  Costs incurred by the Contractor in the 
       performance of the Pre-contractual Work, that would have been 
       treated as costs reasonably and properly incurred if they had been 
       incurred after the effective date of the Contract, will be paid to 
       the Contractor in accordance with the Basis of Payment of the 
       Contract subject to acceptance of the Pre-contractual Work by Canada.  
       The Contractor agrees that upon such payment by Canada to the 
       Contractor, Canada will be released and forever discharged from all 
       manner of actions, claims, suits or demands in relation to the 
       Pre-contractual Work.

2.     The Parties confirm that copyright in the Pre-contractual Work 
   belongs to Canada and that ownership of all intellectual property rights 
   in all information of a scientific, technical or artistic nature 
   relating to the Work, in any form or medium, conceived, developed or 
   produced by the Contractor in the performance of the Pre-contractual 
   Work belongs to Canada.
