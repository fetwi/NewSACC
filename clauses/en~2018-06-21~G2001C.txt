<h3 class="clause-heading">Remarks â€“ Recommended Use of SACC Item</h3><section class="remarks group-sacc-remarks field-group-section">
<p>
  Use the following clause when insurance requirements are specifically described 
in the contract (except when using
  
   G2030C
  
  ,
  
   G4001C
  
  or
  
   G5003C
  
  ).
 </p>
<p>
  Whenever the liabilities of Canada and the contractor with respect to the 
contract are difficult to separate, contracting officers must replace paragraph 
2.(a) by the following option:
 </p>
<p>
  "Additional Named Insured: Canada is added as an additional named insured, but 
only with respect to liability arising out of the performance of the Contract."
 </p>
<p>
  Contracting officers must choose options (l), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q) and/or (r) 
in paragraph 2 when applicable to their specific contract.
 </p>
<p>
  Contracting officers must consult

  Risk Management Advisory Services, at:
  
   NCR.RMIAS-SCGRA@pwgsc.gc.ca
  
  if the suggested limit of $2,000,000 per accident or occurrence is not considered adequate.
 </p>
<p>
  Construction Contracts: For the majority of construction contracts, the 
Contractor's Commercial General Liability policy is sufficient to protect the 
interests of Canada.  If a large, multi-million dollar project involving many 
contractors and subcontractors is being planned, then a separate Wrap-Up 
Liability policy should be arranged specific to the project. Clauses pertaining 
to wrap-up liability should be drafted at that time and will be specific to the 
project.

All expenses incurred by Canada to co-defend such actions will be at Canada's expense. If Canada decides to co-defend any action brought against it, and Canada does not agree to a proposed settlement agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and the plaintiff(s) that would result in the settlement or dismissal of the action against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the Contractor's insurer for any difference between the proposed settlement amount and the amount finally awarded or paid to the plaintiffs (inclusive of costs and interest) on behalf of Canada.
