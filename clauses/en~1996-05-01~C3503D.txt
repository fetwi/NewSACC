<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>1.     Subject to the following provisions, a portion of the price may be 
       increased or decreased, depending on the price variation of paper 
       stock, between the date the Contractor submitted its bid and the 
       date of first delivery of work.

2.     In the event of paper cost variation, the Contractor shall provide 
       notice of increase or decrease of the price of paper used for this 
       Contract, within ten (10) days of the date of first delivery of work, 
       indicating the price fluctuation of paper stock, as publicly 
       announced by at least three (3) Canadian paper mills.

3.     Canada has the sole right to either accept the proposed price change, 
       or to refuse the change. Refusal implies that the Contract is ipso 
       facto annulled "ab initio" (retroactively, as if it never had 
       existed), with no costs or liabilities to any party. The right of 
       Canada shall be exercised in writing, be sent to the Contractor 
       within ten (10) days of receipt of the Contractor's notice of price 
       fluctuation, regardless if some or all paper has then been delivered, 
       all unused paper shall be returned to the Contractor, at Canada's 
       cost, and all used paper shall be paid for at the new published 
       price. 

4.     Acceptance of the price fluctuation will be evidenced by a contract 
       amendment. Until such an amendment is issued, prices are not to be 
       invoiced at a different rate than the rate stated in this Contract.
