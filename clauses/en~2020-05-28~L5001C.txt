The spreadsheet must include as a minimum, the quantity, unit of issue, description of items including part number, location of property and classification of property. The classification of property field must identify if the surplus property must be classified as a controlled or a non-controlled good, which is either new serviceable, used serviceable or repairable, used unserviceable or scrap.
