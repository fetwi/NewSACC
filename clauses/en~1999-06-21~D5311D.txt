<pre>Once final processing has been completed at a federally inspected plant, 
the Contractor shall not alter, process or repack any meats that have been 
inspected and approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

For greater certainty, and without limiting any of Canada's rights granted 
by or referred to in any provision of the Contract to conduct inspections 
or with respect to access to the Work, the Inspection Authority or its 
designate shall have access to the storage and refrigeration areas on the 
Contractor's premises at any time during the performance of the Contract in 
order to inspect the packaging and, if applicable, any processing of the 
meats. The Contractor shall afford all reasonable assistance to the 
Inspection Authority and shall provide such information as the Inspection 
Authority may require concerning the preparation, packaging, and quality of 
the meats.
