<li>If at any time it becomes apparent to the Contractor that it may be unable to fulfill any of its Inuit Benefits Plan (IBP) obligations, the Contractor must inform the Contracting Authority without waiting for the submission of an <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> Progress Report to be required.</li>
<li>If requested by the Contracting Authority, the Contractor must provide a detailed explanation, within the timeframe specified by the Contracting Authority, regarding any actual or anticipated inability to fulfill any of its <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> obligations.</li>
<li>If requested by the Contracting Authority, the Contractor must propose, within the timeframe specified by the Contracting Authority, a written Corrective Action Plan to address the deviation(s). The Corrective Action Plan may involve an amendment to the <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> to provide alternative forms of benefits agreed upon by the Parties.</li>
<li>Any amendment to the <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> must be documented through a formal contract amendment, which will only be issued if the Parties agree to modify the <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr>. Canada may, in its discretion, refuse to accept modifications to the <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> if, in Canadaâ€™s opinion, the proposed amendments do not offer the same value of benefits.</li>
<li>Any reduction in benefits may be considered by Canada as any other failure to meet a contractual obligation.</li>
