</dl>
</li>
<li value="2">Words and expressions defined in the General
Conditions and used in these supplemental general conditions have
the meanings given to them in the General Conditions unless
provided otherwise. If the General Conditions contain sections
entitled "Ownership" and "Warranty", those sections do not apply to
the Licensed Software and the Media. Instead, the ownership and
warranty provisions in these supplemental general conditions apply
to the Licensed Software and the Media.</li>
<li value="3">If there is any inconsistency between the General
Conditions and these supplemental general Conditions, the
applicable provisions of these supplemental general conditions will
prevail.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003license-grant">4003 02 (2008-05-12) License Grant</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor grants to Canada a non-exclusive
license to use and reproduce the Licensed Software in accordance
with the conditions of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">Subject to the transfer rights described in section
08, the Client is the only entity authorized to use and reproduce
the Licensed Software on behalf of Canada. If the Client is
reconfigured, absorbed by another government department or agency,
or is disbanded entirely, the Contracting Authority may, by giving
notice to the Contractor, designate another department, agency or
Crown corporation as the "Client" for the purposes of the
Contract.</li>
<li value="3">Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, the
license granted under the Contract is unaffected by changes in the
Client's environment, such as changes to the operating system,
types of Devices, or other software products used by the Client
from time to time in addition to the Licensed Software.</li>
<li value="4">Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, the
license granted under the Contract is a User License as described
in section 04 below.</li>
<li value="5">The Contractor must provide the English language
version of the Licensed Software and, if available, the French
version of the Licensed Software.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003ownership">4003 03 (2008-05-12) Ownership</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada acknowledges that ownership of the Licensed
Software belongs to the Contractor or its licensor and is not
transferred to Canada. As a result, any reference in the Contract
to any part of Licensed Software as a deliverable must be
interpreted as a reference to the license to use that Licensed
Software, not to own the Licensed Software.</li>
<li value="2">Canada acknowledges that, in performing any warranty,
maintenance, support and professional services related to the
Licensed Software (if required under the Contract), the Contractor
and its employees, agents, and subcontractors may develop and share
with Canada ideas, know-how, teaching techniques and other
intellectual property. Unless otherwise provided in the Contract,
ownership to that intellectual property will remain with the
Contractor. As long as the Contractor at all times observes the
confidentiality provisions of the Contract, the Contractor will be
entitled to use that intellectual property for whatever purposes it
sees fit, including in the services it provides to its other
customers, on the condition that Canada also has the right to use
that intellectual property for its own business purposes at no
additional cost. The Contractor agrees that all data, know-how or
other intellectual property created or owned by Canada will remain
the property of Canada, regardless of whether that data is created,
processed, or stored using the Licensed Software.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003user-license">4003 04 (2008-05-12) User License</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, a "User License"
entitles the designated number of Users specified in the Contract
to access, install, copy, deploy, test and use the Licensed
Software for government purposes unrestricted by the number or type
of installations, locations, servers, processors, data, documents,
transactions, platforms, devices, networks, operating systems,
application program interfaces or operating environments that a
User may be using or processing at any time including any equipment
required to allow Users to work remotely; all without requiring the
purchase of any further licenses or rights.</p>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003device-license">4003 05 (2008-05-12) Device License</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, a "Device License"
entitles Users to access, install, copy, deploy, test and use the
Licensed Software for government purposes on the designated number
of Devices specified in the Contract without requiring Canada to
purchase any additional licenses to software or components; all
without any restriction on the use of associated peripheral
equipment. The Device License allows the Client to use the Licensed
Software unrestricted by the number or type of Users, data,
documents and/or transactions a Client or a User may be using or
processing at any time, or the location of a Device.</p>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003entity-license">4003 06 (2008-05-12) Entity License</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, an "Entity License"
entitles the Client to use the Licensed Software for government
purposes throughout the entity in association with any number of
Devices or by any number of Users. The Entity License allows the
Client to use the Licensed Software in whole or in part,
unrestricted by the number or type of Users, data, documents and/or
transactions a Client or a User may be using or processing at any
time, or the location of the Device.</p>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003disabling-codes">4003 07 (2008-05-12) Disabling Codes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the Licensed Software contains any features,
functions or characteristics ("Disabling Codes") that might cause
the Licensed Software to be unusable by Canada without passwords,
authorization codes or similar information, the Contractor must
provide to Canada, in advance and on an ongoing basis, provided
Canada is not in default of its obligations regarding the use of
the Licensed Software, all the information required by Canada to
continue to use the Licensed Software.</li>
<li value="2">If the license is perpetual, the Contractor must
deliver this information regardless of whether the Contract has
otherwise expired and regardless of whether Canada is currently
receiving maintenance or support for the Licensed Software.</li>
<li value="3">If the existence or characteristics of any Disabling
Code are not known to the Contractor, but the Contractor later
becomes aware of them, the Contractor must correct or remove the
Disabling Code from the Licensed Software or take whatever other
steps are necessary to ensure that Canada is able to continue using
the Licensed Software.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003licensed-software-transfer">4003 08 (2008-05-12) Licensed Software - Transfer</h2>
<p>The license to use the Licensed Software under the Contract is
transferable by Canada under the same conditions of the Contract,
to any Device or Client, as applicable, or to any Canadian
government department, corporation or agency, as defined in the
<cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes of Canada">R.S.C.</abbr> 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. F-11, as
amended from time to time, or to any other party for which the
Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada has been
authorized to act under section 16 of the <cite>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada ">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. 16,
as long as Canada informs the Contractor of the transfer within
thirty (30) days of the transfer occurring. For the purposes of
this section, in the circumstances where an Entity License is
transferred, such license will be capped at the number of users in
the transferring department, corporation, agency or other party
before the transfer.</p>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003software-documentation">4003 09 (2008-05-12) Software Documentation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Copyright in the Software Documentation will not be
owned by or transferred to Canada. However, Canada has the right to
use the Software Documentation and may, for its own internal
purposes, copy it for use by individuals using or supporting the
Licensed Software, as long as Canada includes any copyright and/or
proprietary right notice that was part of the original document in
any copy. Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, Canada must
not otherwise reproduce the Software Documentation without first
obtaining the written consent of the Contractor.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor guarantees that the Software
Documentation contains enough detail to permit a User to access,
install, copy, deploy, test and use all features of the Licensed
Programs. If the source code for the Licensed Programs must be
provided to Canada under the Contract, the Contractor guarantees
that the code provided will contain enough detail to permit a
programmer, experienced in the use of the programming language or
languages in which the source code is written, to modify the
Licensed Programs.</li>
<li value="3">If the Software Documentation is available in both of
the two official languages of Canada, the Contractor must deliver
it in both French and English. If the Software Documentation is
only available in either English or French, it may be delivered in
that language; however, Canada then has the right to translate it.
Canada owns any translation and is under no obligation to provide
it to the Contractor. Canada will include any copyright and/or
proprietary right notice that was part of the original document in
any translation. The Contractor is not responsible for technical
errors that arise as a result of any translation made by
Canada.</li>
<li value="4">Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, at no
additional cost to Canada, the Contractor must update the Software
Documentation throughout the period of the Contract to the most
current release level consistent with the Licensed Software
delivered under the Contract. The Contractor must provide these
updates to Canada within ten (10) days of the update being
available. These updates must include supporting documentation for
all modifications to the Licensed Software, including new versions
and new releases that Canada is entitled to receive under the
Contract and must identify any problems resolved, enhancements
made, or features added to the Licensed Software, together with
installation instructions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003media">4003 10 (2008-05-12) Media</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor must deliver the Licensed Programs to
Canada on the medium of Canada's choice from among those the
Contractor makes available to its other customers (for example, <abbr title="Compact Disc Read-only Memory">CD-ROM</abbr> or Internet download). The Contractor agrees that Canada may
distribute the Licensed Software to Users on Canada's choice of
Media.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor guarantees that the Media will be
compatible with the computer systems, as detailed in the Contract,
on which the Licensed Programs will be installed. The Contractor
also guarantees that the Media, as supplied by the Contractor, will
be free from computer viruses.</li>
<li value="3">Canada will own the Media once it has been delivered
to and accepted by or on behalf of Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003term-of-license">4003 11 (2008-05-12) Term of License</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, Canada's
license to use the Licensed Software is perpetual, regardless of
any termination of the Contract by mutual consent, for the
convenience of Canada or for default of the Contractor, as long as
Canada has paid for the license to the Licensed Software. Any
perpetual license granted under the Contract can only be terminated
by the Contractor in accordance with subsection 2 below.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor may terminate Canada's license with
respect to the Licensed Software by giving the Contracting
Authority written notice to that effect if Canada is in breach of
its license with respect to the Licensed Software, or fails to pay
for the license in accordance with the Contract, and if that breach
continues for a period of thirty (30) days after the Contracting
Authority receives written notice from the Contractor giving
particulars of the breach.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003acceptance">4003 12 (2010-01-11) Acceptance</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Work Subject to Acceptance: All Licensed Programs
delivered and all services provided under the Contract are subject
to inspection by Canada. If any of the Licensed Programs does not
meet all the requirements of the Contract, Canada may reject it or
require that it be corrected, at the sole expense of the
Contractor, before recommending payment.</li>
<li value="2">Effect of Acceptance: Acceptance by Canada does not
relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for defects or other
failures to meet the requirements of the Contract or the
Contractor's responsibilities with respect to warranty, maintenance
or support under the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">Period of Acceptance: Unless provided otherwise in
the Contract, the acceptance procedures are as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">when the Work is complete, the Contractor must notify
the Technical or Project Authority in writing, with a copy to the
Contracting Authority, by referring to this provision of the
Contract and requesting acceptance of the Work;</li>
<li value="2">Canada will have thirty (30) days from receipt of the
notice to perform its inspection (the "Acceptance Period").</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="4">If Canada provides notice of a deficiency during the
Acceptance Period, the Contractor must address the deficiency as
soon as possible and notify Canada in writing once the Work is
complete, at which time Canada will be entitled to re-inspect the
Work before acceptance and the Acceptance Period will begin
again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003right-to-license">4003 13 (2008-05-12) Right to License</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">The Contractor guarantees that it has the right to
license the Licensed Software and full power and authority to grant
to Canada all the rights granted under the Contract. The Contractor
also guarantees that all necessary consents to that grant have been
obtained. Canada agrees that its only remedy and the Contractor's
entire obligations in relation to a breach of this guarantee are
the remedies and obligations set out in the section entitled
"Intellectual Property Infringement and Royalties" contained in the
General Conditions or in the Articles of Agreement, as the case may
be.</li>
<li value="2">The Parties agree that only the conditions that
expressly form part of the Contract by being written out in full in
the Articles of Agreement or an annex to the Contract listed in the
Priority of Documents section in the Articles of Agreement form
part of the Contract. Any conditions accompanying or enclosed with
the Licensed Software, if any, do not form part of the Contract
and, therefore, are not part of Canada's license and do not affect
the rights of the Parties in any way. The Contractor agrees that in
no event will Canada or any Client or User be required to enter
into any additional license agreement with respect to the Licensed
Software or any portion of it. The Contractor acknowledges that any
additional license agreement relating to the Licensed Software
signed by anyone other than the Contracting Authority is void and
of no effect.</li>
<li value="3">Canada is not bound by and does not accept any
"shrink-wrap" or "click-wrap" conditions or any other conditions,
express or implied, that are contained in or on the software
packaging or conditions that may accompany the software in any
manner, regardless of any notification to the contrary.</li>

<h2 id="2010-08-164003enhancements-and-improvements">4003 14 (2008-05-12) Enhancements and Improvements</h2>
<p>The Contractor agrees to provide Canada with all improvements,
updates, upgrades and enhancements to the Licensed Software for
ninety (90) days following the acceptance of the Licensed
Software.</p>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003warranty">4003 15 (2008-05-12) Warranty</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In this section, unless provided otherwise in the
Contract, "<dfn>Software Warranty Period</dfn>" means a period of
ninety (90) days from the date on which the Licensed Software is
accepted in accordance with the conditions of the Contract, except
for warranty work and any other work that is scheduled under the
Contract to be performed after the start of the Software Warranty
Period.</li>
<li value="2">The Contractor warrants that, during the Software
Warranty Period, the Licensed Programs will operate on the computer
system or systems on which the Licensed Programs are installed in
accordance with the Software Documentation that is associated with
the Licensed Programs, as well as the Specifications set out in the
Contract, if any. If the Licensed Programs fail to meet this
warranty at any time during the Software Warranty Period, the
Contractor, if requested by Canada, must, as soon as possible,
correct, at the Contractor's expense, any programming errors and
defects and make any additions, modifications or adjustments to the
Licensed Software that are necessary to keep the Licensed Programs
in operating order, in accordance with the Software Documentation
that is associated with the Licensed Programs and the
Specifications.</li>
<li value="3">Although the Contractor must use all reasonable
efforts to provide permanent corrections for all software
errors,Canada acknowledges that certain errors may not be
permanently corrected by the Contractor under the warranty.
The Contractor must provide a software patch or by-pass around the
error in all cases where the error will not be permanently
corrected. As a minimum, any such software patch or by-pass must
cause the Licensed Programs to meet the functional and performance
criteria set out in the Software Documentation associated with the
Licensed Programs and the Specifications.</li>
<li value="4">The Contractor warrants that, throughout the Software
Warranty Period, the Software Documentation will be free from all
defects in materials and will conform with the requirements of the
Contract. If Canada discovers a defect or non-conformance in any
part of the Software Documentation during the Software Warranty
Period, the Contractor must, if requested by Canada, as soon as
possible, correct, at the Contractor's expense, the part of the
Software Documentation found to be defective or not in conformance
with the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li value="5">The Contractor warrants that, throughout the Software
Warranty Period, the Media will be free from all defects in
materials or workmanship, and will conform with the requirements of
the Contract. Canada may return non-conforming or defective Media
to the Contractor within the Software Warranty Period, with notice
of the non-conformance or the defect, and the Contractor must
promptly replace that Media with corrected Media at no additional
cost to Canada.</li>
<li value="6">If the Contractor must perform support services with
respect to the Licensed Software during the Software Warranty
Period, it is agreed that the provisions concerning support will
not be interpreted so as to derogate from the warranty provisions
set out in this section.</li>
<li value="7">The warranties set out in this section will survive
inspection and acceptance of the Work by or on behalf of Canada,
and do not restrict any other provision of the Contract or any
condition, warranty or provision imposed by law.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003source-code-escrow">4003 16 (2008-05-12) Source Code Escrow</h2>
<p>If requested by Canada, the Contractor must put in place for
Canada, at no additional charge, whatever escrow arrangements, if
any, it usually puts in place for its customers, and must give
Canada, within thirty (30) days from the date of the Contract, a
copy of the agreement with its escrow agent which sets out the
conditions under which the escrow agent is authorized to release
the source code to Canada.</p>
<h2 id="2010-08-164003right-to-modify-and-no-reverse-engineer">4003 17 (2008-05-12) Right to Modify and no Reverse
Engineer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the source code for the Licensed Programs is
provided to Canada under the Contract, that code forms part of the
"Licensed Software" for the purposes of the Contract. Canada will
have the right, at Canada's discretion, to copy and modify the
Licensed Software for Canada's own purposes and use, through the
services of Canada's own employees or of independent contractors,
as long as those contractors agree not to disclose or distribute
any part of the Licensed Software to any other person or entity or
otherwise violate the proprietary rights of the owner of the
Licensed Software.</li>
<li value="2">Canada will be the owner of any modifications
contemplated in this clause, but will obtain no ownership interest
in the Licensed Software, and any portion of the Licensed Software
contained in those modifications will remain subject to the
conditions of Canada's license. The Contractor must not incorporate
any such modifications into its software for distribution to third
parties unless Canada has granted the necessary distribution rights
to the Contractor under a written license agreement. The provisions
ofthis section do not prevent the Contractor or its third-party
licensors from independently developing modifications. Unless
provided otherwise in the Contract, Canada agrees not to reverse
engineer the Licensed Software.</li>

the Media, or to any part of them, will pass to Canada upon
delivery of the Licensed Software or the Media, or that part, to

for loss or damage to the Licensed Software or Media that is caused
by the Contractor or any of its subcontractors after delivery.</li>

<p>In the event of termination or expiration of Canada's license,
Canada will, if requested by the Contractor, either return all

option, will confirm in writing to the Contractor that all copies
of the Licensed Software have been destroyed except for one copy,
which Canada may retain for archival purposes only.</p>
