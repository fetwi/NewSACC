<strong>GC5.1  (2007-05-25)  Interpretation</strong><strong></strong>

In these Terms of Payment

1)     The "payment period" means a period of 30 consecutive days or such 
       other longer period as may be agreed between the Contractor and 
       Canada.

2)     An amount is "due and payable" when it is due and payable by Canada 
       to the Contractor according to GC5.4, "Progress Payment", GC5.5, "
       Substantial Performance of the Work", or GC5.6 "Final Completion".

3)     An amount is overdue when it remains unpaid on the first day 
       following the day upon which it is due and payable.

4)     The "date of payment" means the date of the negotiable instrument of 
       an amount due and payable by the Receiver General for Canada.

5)     The "Bank Rate" means the rate of interest established by the Bank 
       of Canada as the minimum rate at which it makes short term advances 
       to members of the Canadian Payments Association.

6)     The "Average Bank Rate" means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank 
       Rate in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during 
       the calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in 
       which payment is made.

<strong>GC5.2  (2007-05-25)  Amount Payable</strong>

1)     Subject to any other provisions of the Contract, Canada shall pay 
       the Contractor, at the times and in the manner hereinafter set out, 
       the amount by which the amounts payable by Canada to the Contractor 
       in accordance with the Contract exceed the amounts payable by the 
       Contractor to Canada, and the Contractor shall accept that amount as 
       payment in full satisfaction for everything furnished and done by 
       the Contractor in respect of the Work to which the payment relates.

2)     When making any payment to the Contractor, the failure of Canada to 
       deduct an amount payable to Canada by the Contractor shall not 
       constitute a waiver of the right to do so, or an admission of lack 
       of entitlement to do so in any subsequent payment to the Contractor.

3)     No payment other than a payment that is expressly stipulated in the 
       Contract, shall be made by Canada to the Contractor for any extra 
       expense or any loss or damage incurred or sustained by the 
       Contractor.

<strong>GC5.3  (2007-05-25)  Increased or Decreased Costs</strong>

1)     The Contract Amount shall not be increased nor decreased by reason 
       of any increase or decrease in the cost of the Work that is brought 
       about by an increase or decrease in the cost of labour, Plant, 
       Material or any wage adjustment arising pursuant to the Labour 
       Conditions.

2)     Notwithstanding paragraph 1) of GC5.3, if any change, including a 
       new imposition or repeal, of any tax, customs or other duty, charge, 
       or any similar imposition that is imposed under sales, customs or 
       excise tax legislation of the Government of Canada or any Provincial 
       or Territorial legislation, affects the cost of the Work to the 
       Contractor, and occurs

       (a)    after the date of submission by the Contractor of its tender; 
              or 

       (b)    after the date of submission of the last revision, if the 
              Contractor's tender was revised;

       the Contract Amount shall be adjusted in the manner provided in 
       paragraph 3) of GC5.3.

3)     If a change referred to in paragraph 2) of GC5.3 occurs, the 
       Contract Amount shall be increased or decreased by an amount 
       established by an examination by Canada of the relevant records of 
       the Contractor referred to in GC2.8, "Accounts and Audits", to be 
       the increase or decrease in the cost incurred by the Contractor that 
       is directly attributable to that change.

4)     For the purpose of paragraph 2) of GC5.3, if a tax is changed after 
       the tender closing, but public notice of the change has been given 
       by the Minister of Finance or the corresponding Provincial or 
       Territorial authority before that closing, the change shall be 
       deemed to have occurred before the tender closing.

5)     Notwithstanding paragraphs 2) to 4) of GC5.3, no adjustment to the 
       Contract Amount in respect of the Work or a part thereof shall be 
       made for a change in any imposition referred to in this section that 
       occurs after the date required by the Contract for completion of the 
       Work or that part of the Work.

<strong>GC5.4  (2007-05-25)  Progress Payment</strong>

1)     On the expiration of a payment period, the Contractor shall deliver 
       to Canada

       (a)    a written progress claim in a form acceptable to Canada that 
              fully describes any part of the Work that has been completed, 
              and any Material that was delivered to the Work site but not 
              incorporated into the Work, during that payment period, and

       (b)    a completed and signed statutory declaration containing a 
              declaration that, up to the date of the progress claim, the 
              Contractor has complied with all lawful obligations with 
              respect to the Labour Conditions and that, in respect of the 
              Work, all lawful obligations of the Contractor to its 
              Subcontractors and Suppliers, referred to collectively in the 
              declaration as " subcontractors and suppliers", have been 
              fully discharged. 

2)     Within 10 days of receipt of a progress claim and statutory 
       declaration from the Contractor, Canada shall inspect, or cause to 
       have inspected, the part of the Work and the Material described in 
       the progress claim, and shall issue a progress report to the 
       Contractor, that indicates the value of the part of the Work and the 
       Material described in the progress claim that, in the opinion of 
       Canada

       (a)    is in accordance with the Contract; and

       (b)    was not included in any other progress report relating to the 
              Contract.

3)     Subject to GC5.2, "Amount Payable", and paragraph 5) of GC5.4, 
       Canada shall pay the Contractor an amount that is equal to

       (a)    95% of the value that is indicated in Canada's progress 
              report if a labour and material payment bond has been 
              furnished by the Contractor; or

       (b)    90% of the value that is indicated in Canada's progress 
              report if a labour and material payment bond has not been 
              furnished by the Contractor.

4)     Canada shall pay the amount referred to in paragraph 3) of GC5.4 not 
       later than

       (a)    30 days after receipt by Canada of both a progress claim and 
              a statutory declaration referred to in paragraph 1) of GC5.4; 
              or

       (b)    15 days after receipt by Canada of the Contractor's progress 
              schedule or updated progress schedule, in accordance with GC3.1, 
              "Progress Schedule",  
       whichever is later.

5)     In the case of the Contractor's first progress claim, it is a 
       condition precedent to Canada's obligation under paragraph 3) of GC5.4 
       that the Contractor has provided all necessary documentation 
       required by the Contract for the first progress claim and has 
       provided evidence of compliance with workers' compensation 
       legislation applicable to the place of the Work in accordance with 
       GC1.9, "Workers' Compensation".

<strong>GC5.5  (2007-05-25)  Substantial Performance of the Work</strong>

1)     If, at any time before the issuance of a Certificate of Completion, 
       Canada determines that the Work has reached Substantial Performance 
       as described in subparagraph 1) (b) of GC1.1.4, "Substantial 
       Performance", Canada shall issue a Certificate of Substantial 
       Performance to the Contractor.  The Certificate of Substantial 
       Performance shall state or describe

       (a)    the date of Substantial Performance;

       (b)    the parts of the Work not completed to the satisfaction of 
              Canada; and

       (c)    all things that must be done by the Contractor before a 
              Certificate of Completion is issued and before the 12-month 
              warranty period referred to in GC3.13, "Warranty and 
              Rectification of Defects in Work", commences for the said 
              parts and all the said things.

2)     The issuance of a Certificate of Substantial Performance does not 
       relieve the Contractor from the Contractor's obligations under GC3.11, 
       "Defective Work".

3)     Subject to GC5.2, "Amount Payable", and paragraph 4) of GC5.5, 
       Canada shall pay the Contractor the amount referred to in paragraph 
       1) of GC5.2, "Amount Payable", less the aggregate of

       (a)    the sum of all payments that were made pursuant to GC5.4, "
              Progress Payment";

       (b)    an amount that is equal to Canada's estimate of the cost to 
              Canada of rectifying defects described in the Certificate of 
              Substantial Performance; and 

       (c)    an amount that is equal to Canada's estimate of the cost to 
              Canada of completing the parts of the Work described in the 
              Certificate of Substantial Performance other than defects 
              listed therein. 

4)     Canada shall pay the amount referred to in paragraph 3) of GC5.5 not 
       later than 

       (a)    30 days after the date of issue of a Certificate of 
              Substantial Performance, or 

       (b)    15 days after the Contractor has delivered to Canada

              (i)    a statutory declaration containing a declaration by 
                     the Contractor that up to the date of the Certificate 
                     of Substantial Performance, the Contractor has 
                     complied with all lawful obligations with respect to 
                     the Labour Conditions, discharged all its lawful 
                     obligations to its Subcontractors and Suppliers in 
                     respect of the work under the Contract, and discharged 
                     its lawful obligations referred to in GC1.8, "Laws, 
                     Permits and Taxes";

              (ii)   evidence of compliance with workers' compensation 
                     legislation in accordance with GC1.9, "Workers' 
                     Compensation"; and 

              (iii)  an update of the progress schedule in accordance with 
                     the requirements of GC3.1, "Progress Schedule";

       whichever is later.

<strong>GC5.6  (2007-05-25)  Final Completion</strong>

1)     When Canada is of the opinion that the Contractor has complied with 
       the Contract and all orders and directions made pursuant thereto, 
       and that the Work has been completed as described in GC1.1.5, "
       Completion", Canada shall issue a Certificate of Completion to the 
       Contractor and, if the Work or a portion of the Work is subject to a 
       Unit Price Arrangement, Canada shall issue a Certificate of 
       Measurement that shall, subject to GC8, be binding upon and 
       conclusive between Canada and the Contractor as to the quantities 
       referred to therein.

2)     Subject to GC5.2, "Amount Payable", and paragraph 3) of GC5.6, 
       Canada shall pay the Contractor the amount referred to in GC5.2, "
       Amount Payable", less the aggregate of the sum of all payments that 
       were made pursuant to GC5.4, "Progress Payment", and GC5.5, "
       Substantial Performance of Work".

3)     Canada shall pay the amount referred to in paragraph 2) of GC5.6 not 
       later than

       (a)    60 days after the date of issue of a Certificate of 
              Completion; or

       (b)    15 days after the Contractor has delivered to Canada

              (i)    a statutory declaration which contains a declaration 
                     by the Contractor that all of the Contractor's lawful 
                     obligations and any lawful claims against the 
                     Contractor that arose out of the performance of the 
                     Contract have been discharged and satisfied; and 

              (ii)   evidence of compliance with workers' compensation 
                     legislation in accordance with GC1.9, "Workers' 
                     Compensation";

       whichever is later.

<strong>GC5.7  (2007-05-25)  Payment Not Binding on Canada</strong>

1)     Neither acceptance of a progress claim or progress report, nor any 
       payment made by Canada under the Contract, nor partial or entire use 
       or occupancy of the Work by Canada shall constitute an acceptance by 
       Canada of any portion of the Work or Material that is not in 
       accordance with the requirements of the Contract.

<strong>GC5.8  (2007-05-25)  Claims and Obligations</strong>

1)     The Contractor shall discharge all the Contractor's lawful 
       obligations and shall satisfy all lawful claims against the 
       Contractor arising out of the performance of the Work at least as 
       often as the Contract requires Canada to pay the Contractor.

2)     Whenever requested to do so by Canada, the Contractor shall make a 
       statutory declaration declaring to the existence and condition of 
       any obligations and claims against the Contractor arising out of the 
       performance of the Work.

3)     In order to discharge lawful obligations of and satisfy lawful 
       claims against the Contractor or its Subcontractors arising out of 
       the performance of the Contract, Canada may pay an amount that is 
       due and payable to the Contractor directly to the claimant.  Such 
       payment is, to the extent of the payment, a discharge of Canada's 
       liability to the Contractor under the Contract and may be deducted 
       from any amount payable to the Contractor under the Contract. 

4)     For the purposes of paragraph 3) of GC5.8, and subject to paragraph 
       6) of GC5.8, a claim or obligation shall be considered lawful when 
       it is so determined by

       (a)    a court of legal jurisdiction;

       (b)    an arbitrator duly appointed to arbitrate the claim; or

       (c)    the written consent of the Contractor authorizing payment of 
              the claim or obligation. 

5)     If a claim or obligation would have been subject to the provisions 
       of Provincial or Territorial lien legislation or, in the Province of 
       Quebec, the law relating to legal hypothecs had the Contractor been 
       performing the Work for an entity other than Canada

       (a)    such amount as may be paid by Canada pursuant to paragraphs 3) 
              and 4) of GC5.8 shall not exceed the amount that the 
              Contractor would have been obliged to pay had the provisions 
              of such legislation or law been applicable to the Work;
 
       (b)    a claimant need not comply with the provisions of such 
              legislation, setting out the steps by way of notice, 
              registration or otherwise as might have been necessary to 
              preserve or perfect any claim for lien or privilege which the 
              claimant might have had; and 

       (c)    for the purposes of determining the entitlement of a claimant, 
              the notice required by paragraph 8) of GC5.8 shall be deemed 
              to replace the registration or provision of notice after the 
              performance of work as required by any applicable legislation 
              and no claim shall be deemed to have expired, become void or 
              unenforceable by reason of the claimant not commencing any 
              action within the time prescribed by such legislation.

6)     The Contractor shall, at the request of any claimant, submit to 
       binding arbitration those questions that need to be answered to 
       establish the entitlement of the claimant to payment.  The 
       arbitration shall have as parties to it any Subcontractor or 
       Supplier to whom the claimant supplied Material, performed work or 
       rented equipment should such Subcontractor or Supplier wish to be 
       adjoined, and Canada shall not be a party to such arbitration.  
       Subject to any agreement between the Contractor and the claimant, 
       the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the governing 
       Provincial or Territorial legislation applicable to the site of the 
       Work. 

7)     Paragraph 3) of GC5.8 shall apply only to claims and obligations

       (a)    the notification of which has set forth the amount claimed to 
              be owing and the person who by contract is primarily liable 
              and has been received by Canada in writing before final 
              payment is made to the Contractor pursuant to GC5.6, "Final 
              Completion", and within 120 days of the date on which the 
              claimant

              (i)    should have been paid in full under the claimant's 
                     contract with the Contractor, its Subcontractor or 
                     Supplier if the claim is for money that was lawfully 
                     required to be held back from the claimant; or

              (ii)   performed the last of the services, work or labour, or 
                     furnished the last of the Material pursuant to the 
                     claimant's contract with the Contractor or its 
                     Subcontractor or Supplier where the claim is for money 
                     not lawfully required to be held back from the 
                     claimant; and 

       (b)    the proceedings to determine the right to payment of which, 
              pursuant to paragraph 5) of GC5.8, shall have commenced 
              within one year from the date that the notification required 
              by subparagraph 7)(a) of GC5.8 was received by Canada.

8)     Upon receipt of a notice of claim, Canada may withhold, from any 
       amount that is due and payable to the Contractor pursuant to the 
       Contract, the full amount of the claim or any portion thereof.

9)     Canada shall notify the Contractor in writing in a timely manner of 
       receipt of any claim and of the intention of Canada to withhold 
       funds.  At any time thereafter and until payment is made to the 
       claimant, the Contractor may be entitled to post, with Canada, 
       security in a form acceptable to Canada in an amount equal to the 
       value of the claim, and upon receipt of such security Canada shall 
       release to the Contractor any funds that would be otherwise payable 
       to the Contractor, that were withheld pursuant to the provisions of 
       this clause in respect of the claim of any claimant for whom the 
       security stands.

<strong>GC5.9  (2007-05-25)  Right of Setoff</strong>

1)     Without limiting any right of setoff or deduction given or implied 
       by law or elsewhere in the Contract, Canada may set off any amount 
       payable to Canada by the Contractor under the Contract, or under any 
       current contract, against any amount payable to the Contractor under 
       the Contract.

2)     For the purposes of paragraph 1) of GC5.9, "current contract" means 
       a contract between Canada and the Contractor

       (a)    under which the Contractor has an undischarged obligation to 
              perform or supply work, labour or material; or

       (b)    in respect of which Canada has, since the date of the 
              Contract, exercised any right to take the work that is the 
              subject of that contract out of the Contractor's hands.
 
<strong>GC5.10 (2007-05-25)  Assessments and Damages for Late Completion</strong>

1)     For the purposes of this clause 

       (a)    the Work shall be deemed to be completed on the date of the 
              Certificate of Completion; and

       (b)    the "period of delay" means the number of days commencing on 
              the day fixed for completion of the Work and ending on the 
              day immediately preceding the day on which the Work is 
              completed but does not include any day within a period of 
              extension granted pursuant to GC6.5, "Delays and Extension of 
              Time", and any other day on which, in the opinion of Canada, 
              completion of the Work was delayed for reasons beyond the 
              control of the Contractor.

2)     If the Contractor does not complete the Work by the day fixed for 
       its completion but completes it thereafter, the Contractor shall pay 
       Canada an amount equal to the aggregate of

       (a)    all salaries, wages and travelling expenses incurred by 
              Canada in respect of persons overseeing the performance of 
              the Work during the period of delay;
       (b)    the cost incurred by Canada as a result of the inability to 
              use the completed Work for the period of delay; and

       (c)    all other expenses and damages incurred or sustained by 
              Canada during the period of delay as a result of the Work not 
              being completed by the day fixed for its completion.

3)     Canada may waive the right of Canada to the whole or any part of the 
       amount payable by the Contractor pursuant to paragraph 2) of GC5.10 
       if, in the opinion of Canada, it is in the public interest to do so.

<strong>GC5.11 (2007-05-25)  Delay in Making Payment</strong>

1)     Notwithstanding GC1.5, "Time of the Essence", any delay by Canada in 
       making any payment when it is due pursuant to GC5 shall not be a 
       breach of the Contract by Canada.

2)     Subject to paragraph 3) of GC5.11, Canada shall pay to the 
       Contractor simple interest at the Average Bank Rate plus 3 percent 
       per annum on any amount that is overdue pursuant to paragraph 3) of 
       GC5.1, and the interest shall apply from and include the day such
