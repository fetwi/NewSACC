<ol type="1">
<li value="1"><strong>Canadian good</strong>: A good wholly manufactured or originating in Canada is considered a Canadian good. A product containing imported components may also be considered Canadian for the purpose of this policy when it has undergone sufficient change in Canada, in a manner that satisfies the definition specified under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) Rules of Origin. For the purposes of this determination, the reference in the <abbr title="Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement">CUSMA</abbr> Rules of Origin to "territory of one or more of the Parties" is to be replaced with "Canada". (Consult Section 3.130 and Annex 3.6 of the Supply Manual for further information.)
        </li>
<li value="2"><strong>Canadian service</strong>: A service provided by an individual based in Canada is considered a Canadian service. Where a requirement consists of only one service, which is being provided by more than one individual, the service will be considered Canadian if a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price for the service is provided by individuals based in Canada.</li>

<li value="2">item by item evaluation: in some cases, the bid evaluation may be conducted on an item-by-item basis and contracts may be awarded to more than one supplier. In these cases, suppliers will be asked to identify separately each item that meets the definition of Canadian goods.</li>
