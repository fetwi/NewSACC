on an individual item basis and where the bidder is to list in the clause those 
items in its bid that are to be considered Canadian goods and/or Canadian 
services.  This clause must be used in conjunction with clause K4000D - Canadian

valid certification. 

The Bidder acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such representation 
and warranty to evaluate bids and may rely upon such representation and 
warranty to enter into any contract resulting from this bid.  Such

bid as being in default.

immediately following this paragraph or to include it with the bid may 
render the bid non-responsive.
