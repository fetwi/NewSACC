<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre><div class="sacc-item">
<ol type="a">
<li value="1"><abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may, subject to the provisions of paragraph c)
below, by written notice of default to the Contractor, terminate
the whole or any part of this Contract in any one of the following
circumstances:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">if the Contractor fails to make delivery of the
supplies or to perform the services within the time specified
herein or any extension thereof; or</li>
<li value="2">if the Contractor fails to perform any of the other
provisions of this Contract or so fails to make progress as to
endanger performance of this Contract in accordance with its terms
and, in either of these two circumstances, does not cure such
failure within a period of ten (10) days (or such longer period as <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>
specifying such failure.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">In the event <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> terminates this Contract in whole or
in part as provided in paragraph (a) of this clause, it may
procure, upon such terms and in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, supplies or services similar to those so terminated
and the Contractor shall be liable to <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> for any excess costs for
such similar supplies or services, provided that the Contractor
shall continue the performance of the Contract to the extent not
terminated under the provisions of this clause.</li>
<li value="3">Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier,
the Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the
failure to perform the Contract arises from causes beyond the
Contractor's control and without the Contractor's fault or
negligence. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of
the public enemy, (2) acts of the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government in either its
sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5)
epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight
embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance the
failure to perform must be beyond the Contractor's control and
without the Contractor's fault or negligence. If the failure to
perform is caused by the default of a subcontractor at any tier,
and if the cause of the default is beyond the control of both the
Contractor and its subcontractor, and without the fault or
negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any
excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted
supplies or services were obtainable from other sources in
sufficient time for the Contractor to meet the required delivery
schedule.</li>
<li value="4">If this Contract is terminated as provided in
paragraph (a) of this clause, <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, in addition to any other rights
provided in this clause, may require the Contractor to transfer
title and deliver to the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government, in the manner and to the
extent directed by <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">any completed supplies; and</li>
<li value="2">such partially completed supplies and materials, parts,
tools, dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and
Contract rights (hereinafter called "manufacturing materials") as
the Contractor has specifically produced or specifically acquired
for the performance of such part of this Contract as has been
terminated; and the Contractor shall, upon direction of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>,
protect and preserve property in its possession in which <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> has an
interest. Payment for completed supplies delivered to and accepted
by the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government shall be at the Contract Price. Payment for
manufacturing materials delivered to and accepted by the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
Government and for the protection and preservation of property
shall be in an amount agreed upon by the Contractor and <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>;
failure to agree to such amount shall be a dispute concerning a
question of fact within the meaning of the clause of this Contract
entitled "Disputes". <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> may withhold from amounts otherwise due
the Contractor for such completed supplies or manufacturing
materials such sum as <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> determines to be necessary to protect <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>
against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien
holders.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">If, after notice of termination of this Contract
under the provisions of this clause, it is determined for any
reason that the Contractor was not in default under the provisions
of this clause, or that the default was excusable under the
provisions of this clause, the rights and obligations of the
parties shall, if the Contract contains a clause providing for
termination for convenience of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr>, be the same as if the notice of
termination had been issued pursuant to such clause. If, after
notice of termination of this Contract under the provisions of this
clause, it is determined for any reason that the Contractor was not
in default under the provisions of this clause, and if this
Contract does not contain a clause providing for termination for
convenience of the Government, the Contract shall be equitably
adjusted to compensate for such termination and the Contract
modified accordingly; failure to agree to any such adjustment shall
be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of
the clause of this Contract entitled "Disputes".</li>
<li value="6">The rights and remedies of <abbr title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> provided in this
clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other
rights and remedies under this Contract provided by law.</li>
