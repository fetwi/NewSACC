(j)    Litigation Rights:  Consistent with subsection 5(d) of the <em>
       Department of Justice Act</em>, R.S.C. 1993, c. J-2, s.1, it is 
       understood and agreed that where any suit is instituted for or 
       against Canada which the Insurer or Insurers would, but for this 
       clause, have the right to pursue or defend on behalf of Canada as an 
       Additional Insured under this insurance policy, the Insurer shall 
       promptly contact the Attorney General of Canada to agree on the 
       legal strategies by sending a letter, by registered mail or by 
       courier, with an acknowledgement of receipt.

       For the province of Quebec, send to:

       Director
       Business Law Directorate
       Quebec Regional Office (Ottawa)
       Department of Justice
       284 Wellington Street, Room SAT-6042 
       Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

              and

       For all other provinces and territories, send to:

       Senior General Counsel
       Civil Litigation Section
       Department of Justice

       The notification must be followed, within a reasonable period, by an 
       information copy to the Contracting Authority.

       The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right to co-defend 
       any action brought against Canada.  However, all expenses incurred 
       by Canada to co-defend such actions would be at Canada's expense.  
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Canada decides to co-defend any 
       action brought against it, and Canada will not agree to a proposed 
       settlement documented and agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and 
       the plaintiff(s) that would result in the settlement or dismissal of 
       the action as against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the 
       Contractor's insurer for any difference between the proposed amount 
       for which the action as against Canada would have been settled and 
       the amount finally awarded or paid to the plaintiffs (inclusive of 
       costs and interest) on behalf of Canada.
