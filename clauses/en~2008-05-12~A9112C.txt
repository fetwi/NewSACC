<h3 class="clause-heading">Legal text for SACC item</h3><pre>The Contractor warrants that it is not under common ownership control of 
another division, parent company or affiliate supplying materials and/or 
services in connection with the performance of the Work under the Contract.  
For the purposes of this warranty, the phrase "ownership control" means 
that at least 50 percent of the voting rights are held by the related 
entity.

The Contractor acknowledges that Canada has relied on the warranty in 
establishing the price payable under the Contract.  In the event of breach 
of such warranty, Canada will have the right to terminate the Contract for 
default or, alternatively, the right to readjust the price to reflect the 
level of profit payable under departmental policy when common ownership 
control exists, as set out in the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services Transfer Pricing Policy published in Chapter 10 of the <em>Supply 
Manual</em>.
