<pre>1.     The evaluation of TECHNICAL proposals will be based on the criteria 
       specified in the attached Appendices/Annexes "_____."

2.     <strong>Technical Proposal</strong>

       TECHNICAL proposals received will be compared separately against the 
       evaluation criteria identified herein for the total requirement of 
       this Request for Proposal (RFP) and in conjunction with the 
       accompanying Statement of Work.

3.     <strong>Evaluation Methodology</strong>

       (a)    Only those proposals which satisfy all MANDATORY requirements 
              detailed herein will be further evaluated.  IT IS MANDATORY 
              FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES THAT PROPOSALS BE PREPARED IN THE 
              FORMAT DESCRIBED HEREIN.  FAILURE TO DO SO SHALL RENDER A 
              PROPOSAL NON-COMPLIANT.

       (b)    Point-Rated Evaluation

              The evaluation process to complete the selection will take 
              place as follows:

              (i)    Mandatory Criteria:

                     Bids not meeting ALL mandatory requirements will be 
                     eliminated from further consideration.

              (ii)   Point-Rated Evaluation:

                     A technical rating, up to the maximum points available 
                     as identified in Appendix/Annex "_____," will be 
                     assigned by the Evaluation Team to score each rated 
                     criterion specified herein.

                     Any proposal not meeting the minimum points required 
                     on each of the rated sections will not be considered 
                     any further in the evaluation process.

              (iii)  Cost:

                     Cost will be evaluated on the total requirement 
                     (Contract period and any applicable option period(s) 
                     to extend using all personnel and estimated number of 
                     days per professional as stated in "_____")<strong><strong><strong> OR </strong></strong></strong>(firm 
                     lot price for Contract period and any applicable 
                     option(s)).

                     <em>(Contracting officers should insert either "all 
                     personnel and estimated number of days..." or "firm 
                     lot price...").</em><em></em>

                     Proposals may be accepted in whole or in part, with or 
                     without negotiation. It is anticipated that only one 
                     Contract will be awarded pursuant to this RFP.

                     Neither the qualifying proposal which scores the 
                     highest number of rating points nor the one which 
                     contains the lowest cost estimate will necessarily be 
                     accepted.

                     The Contract award will be made on the basis of best 
                     overall value to Canada in terms of both technical 
                     merit and cost.  Best overall value is determined by 
                     the lowest cost per point as calculated from a ratio 
                     of the technical points scored to the price for each 
                     compliant proposal evaluated.
