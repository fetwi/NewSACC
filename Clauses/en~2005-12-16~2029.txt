<strong>2029   01     (2005-06-10)  Interpretation</strong>

In the Contract, unless the context otherwise requires:

"Contract" means the written agreement between the Parties, these general 
conditions, any referenced conditions and clauses, and any other document 
specified or referred to as forming part of the Contract, all as amended by 
agreement of the Parties from time to time;

"Contractor" means the person or entity whose name appears on the signature 
page of the written agreement and who is to supply goods or services to 
Canada under the Contract;

"Government Property" means anything supplied to the Contractor by or on 
behalf of Canada for the purposes of performing the Contract and anything 
acquired by the Contractor in any manner in connection with the Work the 
cost of which is paid by Canada under the Contract;<strong></strong>

"Minister" means the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and 
any other person duly authorized to act on behalf of that Minister;<strong></strong>

"Work" means the whole of the activities, services, goods, equipment, 
matters and things required to be done, delivered or performed by the 
Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract.<strong></strong>

<strong>2029   02     (2005-06-10)  Standard Conditions and Clauses</strong>

Pursuant to the <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>, S.C. 
1996, c.16, the conditions and clauses identified by title, number and a 
date in the Contract are incorporated by reference into and form part of 
the Contract as though expressly set out in the Contract.


<strong>2029   03     (2005-06-10)  Status of the Contractor</strong>

The Contractor is engaged as an independent Contractor for the sole purpose 
of performing the Work. Neither the Contractor nor any of its personnel is 
engaged as an employee, servant or agent of Canada. The Contractor is 
responsible for all deductions and remittances required by law in relation 
to its employees. 
 
<strong>2029   04     (2005-06-10)  Inspection, Acceptance and Warranty</strong>

The Contractor must perform the Work efficiently in accordance with 
standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in full conformity with all 
the requirements of the Contract.

The Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada. Despite prior 
acceptance of the Work and without restricting any conditions or warranty 
imposed by law, the Contractor, if requested by the Minister to do so, must 
replace, repair or correct, at its option and its own expense any Work 
which becomes defective or which fails to conform to the Contract 
requirements, where applicable.  For goods, the warranty period will be 
twelve (12) months after delivery and acceptance of the Work or the length 
of the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty period, whichever 
is longer.  Any Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to this 
section is subject to all provisions of the Contract to the same extent as 
Work initially performed.

Canada must pay the transportation cost associated with returning any Work 
to the Contractor for replacement, repair or making good and the Contractor 
must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the replacement 
or returning the Work to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to 
another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of the Minister, 
it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location, the Contractor 
must carry out any necessary repair or making good of the Work at that 
location and will be paid its reasonable travelling and living expenses.

<strong>2029   05     (2005-06-10)  Invoice Submission</strong>

Invoices must be submitted in the name of the Contractor.  They must show 
the name and address of the client department, item/reference number, 
deliverable and/or description of Work, contract serial number, Client 
Reference Number (CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN) and financial 
code(s).  If applicable, the method of shipment together with date, case 
numbers and part or reference numbers, item, quantity, unit of issue, unit 
price, and additional charges will be shown on the invoice.  If applicable, 
fixed time labour rates, level of effort and, the amount invoiced 
(exclusive of the Goods and Services Tax {GST} or Harmonized Sales Tax {HST} 
as appropriate), will be shown separately.

GST, HST or other taxes, if applicable, will be incorporated into all 
invoices and shown as a separate item on invoices.  All goods or services 
that are zero-rated, exempt or to which the GST or HST does not apply, are 
to be identified as such on all invoices.  Invoices must be submitted for 
each delivery/shipment and must apply to one contract only.  Each invoice 
must indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.

<strong>2029   06     (2005-06-10)  Taxes</strong>

1.     Municipal Taxes 
       Municipal Taxes are not applicable.

2.     Provincial Taxes

       (a)    Excluding legislated exceptions, federal government 
              departments and agencies are not required to pay any ad 
              valorem sales tax levied by the province in which the taxable 
              goods or services are delivered.  This exemption has been 
              provided to federal government departments and agencies under 
              the authority of one of the following:

              (i)    Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Exemption Licence Numbers, 
                     for the provinces of:

                     Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250
                     Ontario                     11708174G
                     Manitoba             390-516-0
                     British Columbia     R005521

              (ii)   For Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, the 
                     Northwest Territories and Nunavut, an Exemption 
                     Certification, which certifies that the goods or 
                     services purchased are not subject to the provincial/
                     territorial sales and consumption taxes because they 
                     are being purchased by the federal government with 
                     Canada funds for the use of the federal government. 

       (b)    Currently, in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest 
              Territories and Nunavut, there is no general PST.  However, 
              should a PST be introduced in the Northwest Territories, 
              Nunavut, or Yukon Territory, the sales tax exemption 
              certificate would be required on the purchasing document. 
       (c)    Federal departments are required to pay the Harmonized Sales 
              Tax (HST) in the participating provinces of Newfoundland and 
              Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

       (d)    The Contractor is not exempt from paying PST under the above 
              Exemption Licence Numbers or Exemption Certification. The 
              Contractor is required to pay the PST on taxable goods or 
              services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract 
              (as per appropriate provincial legislation), including 
              material incorporated into real property.

3.     Changes to Taxes and Duties
       In the event of any change in any tax imposed under the <em>Excise Act</em>, 
       R.S.C 1985, c. E-14, and <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, or 
       any duties imposed under the Customs Tariff or any other federal or 
       provincial sales, excise or other like duties, taxes, charges or 
       impositions after the bid submission date and which affects the 
       costs of the Work to the Contractor, the Contract price will be 
       adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the cost to the 
       Contractor.

4.     Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax
       The estimated Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax 
       (HST), if applicable, is included in the total estimated cost on 
       page 1 of the Contract.  The GST or HST is not included in the 
       Contract price but will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice 
       Submission clause above. The Contractor agrees to remit to Canada 
       Revenue Agency any amounts of GST and HST paid or due.

<strong>2029   07     (2005-06-10)  Transportation Charges</strong>

If transportation charges are payable by Canada under the terms of the 
Contract and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, 
shipments must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent 
with normal shipping practice.  The charges must be shown as a separate 
item on the invoice.  The federal government's policy of underwriting its 
own risks precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for 
transportation beyond the point at which title of goods passes to the 
federal government (determined by the FOB point or Incoterms).  Where 
increased carrier liability is available without charge, the Contractor 
must obtain the increased liability for shipment.

<strong>2029   08     (2005-06-10)  Shipment Documentation</strong>

For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading must accompany 
the original invoice, except for "collect" shipments (if and when 
stipulated), in which event it must accompany the shipment.  In addition, a 
packing slip must accompany each shipment, showing item, quantity, part or 
reference numbers, description of suppliers and contract reference numbers, 
including the Client Reference Number (CRN) and Procurement Business Number 
(PBN).  If the goods have been inspected at the Contractor's plant, the 
signed inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally 
enclosed in the packing note envelope.

<strong>2029   09     (2005-06-10)  Payment and Interest on Overdue Accounts</strong>

1.     Payment by Canada for the Work will be made following delivery, 
       inspection and acceptance of the Work, and upon presentation of 
       invoices and any other substantiating documentation as Canada 
       requires.  

2.     For the purposes of this section:

       "Average Rate" means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank Rates in 
       effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during the 
       calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in 
       which payment is made;

       "Bank Rate" means the rate of interest established from time to time 
       by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the Bank of 
       Canada makes short term advances to members of the Canadian Payments 
       Association;

       "date of payment" means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn 
       by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an 
       amount due and payable under the Contract;<strong></strong>

       an amount becomes "overdue" when it is unpaid on the first day 
       following the day upon which it is due and payable in accordance 
       with the terms of the Contract.

3.     Canada is liable to pay to the Contractor simple interest at the 
       Average Rate plus three percent (3%) per annum on any amount that is 
       overdue, from the date such amount becomes overdue until the day 
       prior to the date of payment, inclusive.  Interest will be paid 
       without notice from the Contractor.

4.     Canada is not liable to pay interest in accordance with this section 
       if Canada is not responsible for the delay in paying the Contractor.  
       Canada is not liable to pay interest on overdue advance payments. 

<strong>2029   10     (2005-06-10)  Audit</strong>

The amount claimed by the Contractor under the Contract is subject to audit 
by Canada before or after payment has been made to the Contractor.  The 
Contractor must keep proper accounts and records of the cost of performing 
the Contract and keep all documents relating to such cost for a period of 6 
years after final payment under the Contract.

<strong>2029   11     (2005-06-10)  Compliance with Applicable Laws</strong>

the Work.

<strong>2029   13     (2005-06-10)  Title</strong>

Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, title to the Work (including 
copyright where it exists) belongs to Canada upon delivery and acceptance 
by Canada and the risk of loss or damage remains with the Contractor until 
delivery of the Work to Canada.

<strong>2029   14     (2005-06-10)  Government Property</strong>

The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care of all Government 
Property while such property is in its possession or subject to its control 
and is responsible for any loss or damage, ordinary wear and tear excepted,

The Contract must not be amended or assigned, in whole or in part, without 
the prior written agreement of the parties.

<strong>2029   16     (2005-06-10)  Default by the Contractor</strong>

If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its obligations 
under the Contract, or is bankrupt or insolvent or in receivership, the 
Minister may, upon giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate the 
whole or any part of the Contract.  Upon the giving of such notice, the 
Contractor will have no claim for any further payment and remains liable to 
Canada for all losses and damages suffered by Canada by reason of the 
default, including any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring 
the Work from another source.

<strong>2029   17     (2005-06-10)  Termination for Convenience</strong>

The Minister may, any time prior to the completion of the Work, by giving 
notice to the Contractor in writing, terminate all or any portion of the 
Contract.  In such case, the Contractor will be paid for Work that has been 
performed, accepted and unpaid in accordance with the Contract price.  The 
Contractor will be entitled to be reimbursed the actual costs reasonably 
and properly incurred as a direct result of the termination, but in no case 
such reimbursement must exceed the Contract price.  The Contractor will 
have no claim for damages, compensation, loss of profit or otherwise, 
except as provided in this section.

<strong>2029   18     (2005-06-10)  Members of the House of Commons</strong>

Members of the House of Commons are not admitted to any share or part of 
the Contract or to any benefit resulting from the Contract.

<strong>2029   19     (2005-12-16)  Conflict of Interest</strong>

Directives governing Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment, cannot

<strong>2029   20     (2005-12-16)  Contingency Fees</strong>

The Contractor certifies that it has not directly or indirectly paid or 
agreed to pay and agrees that it will not directly or indirectly pay a 
contingency fee for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the 
Contract to any person, other than an employee of the Contractor acting in 
the normal course of the employee's duties. In this section, "contingency 
fee" means any payment or other compensation that is depending or 
calculated upon the basis of a degree of success in soliciting, negotiating 
or obtaining the Contract and "person" includes any individual who is 
required to file a return with the registrar pursuant to section 5 of the <em>
Lobbyists Registration Act</em>, R.S., 1985, c. 44 (4th Supp.).

<strong>2029   21     (2005-06-10)  International Sanctions</strong>

1.     Persons in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada, are bound by 
       economic sanctions imposed by Canada.  As a result, the Government 
       of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services that originate, 
       either directly or indirectly, from the countries or persons subject 
       to economic sanctions.

       Details on existing sanctions can be found at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline"><a href="http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/trade/" rel="external">http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/trade/</a>

       the Contract, should the imposition of sanctions against a country 
       or person or the addition of a good or service to the list of 
       sanctioned goods or services cause an impossibility of performance 
       for the Contractor, the situation will be treated by the parties as 
       a force majeure.  The Contractor must immediately inform Canada of 
       the situation and the procedures applicable to force majeure will
