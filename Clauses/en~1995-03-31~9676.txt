non-exclusive. 


<strong>9676   03     </strong>(<strong>04/01/94</strong>)    <strong>Status of the Contractor</strong>


The Contractor is engaged as an independent contractor for the sole purpose 
of performing the Work.  Neither the Contractor nor any of its personnel is 
engaged as an employee, servant or agent of Canada.  The Contractor is 
responsible for all deductions and remittances required by law in relation 
to its employees including those required for Canada or Quebec Pension 
Plans, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, or income tax. 


<strong>9676   04     (04/01/94)    Amendments and Waivers</strong>


(1)    No design change, modification to the Work, or amendment to the 
       Contract shall be binding unless it is incorporated into the 
       Contract by written amendment or design change memorandum executed 
       by the authorized representatives of the Minister and of the 
       Contractor.
  
(2)    While the Contractor may discuss any proposed changes or 
       modifications to the scope of the Work with the Technical Authority, 
       Canada shall not be liable for the cost of any such change or 
       modification until it has been incorporated into the Contract in 
       accordance with subsection (1).

(3)    No waiver shall be valid, binding or affect the rights of the 
       Parties unless it is made in writing by, in the case of a waiver by 
       Canada, the Contracting Authority and, in the case of a waiver by 
       the Contractor, the authorized representative of the Contractor.

(4)    The waiver by a Party of a breach of any term or condition of the 
       Contract shall not prevent the enforcement of that term or condition 
       by that Party in the case of a subsequent breach, and shall not be 
       deemed or construed a waiver of any subsequent breach. 


<strong>9676   05     (04/01/94)    Conduct of the Work</strong>
 
(1)    The Contractor represents and warrants that:

       (a)    it is competent to perform the Work; and

       (b)    it has the necessary qualifications, including knowledge, 
              skill and experience to perform the Work, together with the 
              ability to use those qualifications effectively for that 
              purpose.

(2)    Except for Government Property specifically provided for in the 
       Contract, the Contractor shall supply everything necessary for the 
       performance of the Work, including all the resources, facilities, 
       labour and supervision, management, services, equipment, materials, 
       drawings, technical data, technical assistance, engineering services, 
       inspection and quality assurance procedures, and planning necessary 
       to perform the Work.

(3)    The Contractor shall:

       (a)    carry out the Work in a diligent and efficient manner;

       (b)    select and employ on the Work a sufficient number of properly 
              qualified personnel, provide efficient and effective 
              inspection and quality control procedures and provide 
              administration and other support to its employees to the 
              extent necessary to properly carry out the Work;

       (c)    perform the Work in accordance with standards of quality 
              acceptable to the Minister and in full conformity with the 
              Specifications and all the requirements of the Contract; and

       (d)    provide effective and efficient supervision to ensure that 
              the quality of workmanship is as stated in the Contract.

(4)    The Work shall not be performed by any person who, in the opinion of 
       the Minister or the Technical Authority, is incompetent or has been 
       conducting himself/herself improperly.

(5)    The Contractor warrants that all services performed under this 
       Contract will, at the time of acceptance, be free from defects in 
       workmanship and conform to the requirements of this Contract.  If 
       the Contractor is required to correct or replace the Work or any 
       portion thereof, it shall be at no cost to Canada, and any Work 
       corrected or replaced by the Contractor pursuant to this subsection 
       shall be subject to all provisions of this Contract to the same 
       extent as Work initially performed.

(6)    The Contractor shall adhere to the Technical Authority's reasonable 
       interpretation of the requirements of the Contract insofar as such 
       an interpretation is not inconsistent with any other part of the 
       Contract.

(7)    Unless the Minister orders the Work or part thereof to be suspended 
       pursuant to section 22 (Suspension of the Work), the Contractor 
       shall not stop or suspend any part of the Work pending the 
       settlement or resolution of any difference between the Parties 
       arising out of the Contract.

(8)    The Contractor shall provide such reports on the performance of the 
       Work as are required by the Contract and such other reports as may 
       reasonably be required by the Minister or the Technical Authority.

(9)    The Contractor shall be fully responsible for performing the Work 
       and Canada shall not be liable for any negative consequences or 
       extra costs arising out of the Contractor's following any advice 
       given by Canada, whether given without or upon invitation by the 
       Contractor, unless the advice was provided to the Contractor in 
       writing by the Contracting Authority and was accompanied by a 
       statement specifically relieving the Contractor of any  
       responsibility for negative consequences or extra costs that might 
       arise from following the advice.


<strong> </strong><strong></strong>
<strong>9676   06     (04/01/94)    Compliance with Applicable Laws</strong>


The Contractor shall comply with all laws applicable to the performance of 
the Work or any part thereof including, without limitation, all laws 
concerning health and labour conditions and the protection of the 
environment, and shall require compliance therewith by all of its 
subcontractors.  Evidence of compliance with such laws shall be furnished 
by the Contractor to the Contracting Authority at such times as the 
Contracting Authority may reasonably request. 



<strong>9676   07     (04/01/94)    Subcontracting</strong>


(1)    Unless otherwise provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall 
       obtain the consent of the Minister in writing prior to 
       subcontracting or permitting the subcontracting of any portion of 
       the Work at any tier.  

(2)    Notwithstanding subsection (1), the Contractor may, without prior 
       consent of the Minister, subcontract such portions of the Work as is 
       customary in the carrying out of similar contracts.

(3)    In any Subcontract, the Contractor shall, unless the Minister 
       otherwise consents in writing, ensure that the subcontractor is 
       bound by terms and conditions compatible with and, in the opinion of 
       the Minister, not less favourable to Canada than the terms and 
       conditions of the Contract. Deviations in any Subcontract from the 
       terms of the Contract, including any right of termination of the 
       Contract, shall be entirely at the risk of the Contractor.

(4)    The Contractor is not obliged to seek consent to Subcontracts 
       specifically authorized in the Contract.

(5)    Any consent to a Subcontract shall not relieve the Contractor from 
       its obligations under the Contract or be construed as authorizing 
       any liability on the part of Canada or the Minister to a 
       subcontractor. 



<strong>9676   08     (04/01/94)    Replacement of Personnel</strong>


(1)    When specific persons have been named in the Contract as the persons 
       who must perform the Work, the Contractor shall provide the services 
       of the persons so named unless the Contractor is unable to do so for 
       reasons beyond its control.

(2)    If, at any time, the Contractor is unable to provide the services of 
       any specific person named in the Contract, it shall provide a 
       replacement person who is of similar ability and attainment.

(3)    The Contractor shall, before replacing any specific person named in 
       the Contract, provide notice in writing to the Minister containing:

       (a)    the reason for the removal of the named person from the Work;

       (b)    the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed 
              replacement person; and

       (c)    proof that the person has the required security clearance 
              granted by Canada, if applicable.

(4)    The Contractor shall not, in any event, allow performance of the 
       Work by unauthorized replacement persons and acceptance of a 
       replacement person by the Technical Authority and the Contracting 
       Authority shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility to 
       meet the requirements of the Contract.
 
(5)    The Minister may order the removal from the Work of any such 
       replacement person and the Contractor shall immediately remove the 
       person from the Work and shall, in accordance with subsection (2) 
       and paragraphs 3(b) and (c), secure a further replacement.

(6)    The fact that the Minister does not order the removal of a 
       replacement person from the Work shall not relieve the Contractor 
       from its responsibility to meet the requirements of the Contract.


<strong>9676   09     (04/01/94)    Assignment</strong>


(1)    The Contract shall not be assigned, in whole or in part, by the 
       Contractor without the prior consent in writing of the Minister and 
       any purported assignment made without that consent is void and of no 
       effect.

(2)    No assignment of the Contract shall relieve the Contractor from any 
       obligation under the Contract or impose any liability upon Canada or 
       the Minister, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Minister. 


<strong>9676   10     (04/01/94)    Time of the Essence</strong>


Time is of the essence of the Contract. 



<strong>9676   11     (04/01/94)    Excusable Delay</strong>


(1)    A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any obligation under 
       the Contract which is caused solely by an event that

       (a)    was beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor,

       (b)    could not reasonably have been foreseen,

       (c)    could not reasonably have been prevented by means reasonably 
              available to the Contractor, and

       (d)    occurred without the fault or neglect of the Contractor

       shall, subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), constitute an "
       Excusable Delay" provided that the Contractor invokes this section 
       by notice under subsection (4).    

(2)    If any delay in the Contractor's performance of any obligation under 
       the Contract is caused by a delay of a Subcontractor, such a delay 
       may constitute an Excusable Delay for the Contractor, but only if 
       the delay of the Subcontractor meets the criteria set out in this 
       section for an Excusable Delay by the Contractor and only to the 
       extent that the delay has not been contributed to by the Contractor.

(3)    Notwithstanding subsection (1), any delay caused by lack of 
       financial resources of the Contractor or an event that is a ground 
       for termination provided for in subsection 23(2) (Default by the 
       Contractor), or any delay in the Contractor fulfilling an obligation 
       to deliver a bond, guarantee, letter of credit or other security 
       relating to performance or the payment of money, shall not qualify 
       as an Excusable Delay.

(4)    The Contractor shall not benefit from an Excusable Delay unless the 
       Contractor has:

       (a)    used its best efforts to minimize the delay and recover lost 
              time; 
       (b)    advised the Minister of the occurrence of the delay or of the 
              likelihood of a delay occurring as soon as the Contractor has 
              become aware of it;

       (c)    within 15 working days of the beginning of a delay or of the 
              likelihood of a delay coming to the attention of the 
              Contractor, advised the Minister of the full facts or matters 
              giving rise to the delay, and provided to the Minister for 
              approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) 
              a clear "work-around" plan indicating in detail the steps 
              that the Contractor proposes to take in order to minimize the 
              impact of the event causing the delay; this plan shall 
              include alternative sources of materials and labour, if the 
              event causing the delay involves the supply of them; and

       (d)    carried out the work-around plan approved by the Minister.

(5)    In the event of an Excusable Delay, any delivery date or other date 
       that is directly affected shall be postponed for a reasonable time 
       not to exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay. The Parties shall 
       amend the Contract, as appropriate, to reflect any such change in 
       dates.

(6)    Notwithstanding subsection (5), the Minister may, after an Excusable 
       Delay has continued for 30 days or more, in the Minister's absolute 
       discretion terminate the Contract.  In such a case, the Parties 
       agree that neither will make any claim against the other for damages, 
       costs, expected profits or any other loss arising out of the 
       termination or the event that gave rise to the Excusable Delay.  The 
       Contractor agrees to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any 
       advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.  
       Subsections 23(4), (5) and (6) (Default by the Contractor) apply in 
       the event of a termination under this subsection.

(7)    Except to the extent that Canada is responsible for the delay for 
       reasons of failure to meet an obligation under the Contract, Canada 
       shall not be liable for any costs or charges of any nature incurred 
       by the Contractor or any of its Subcontractors or agents as a result 
       of an Excusable Delay.


<strong>9676   12     (04/01/94)    Security and Protection of the Work</strong>


(1)    The Contractor shall keep confidential all information provided to 
       the Contractor by or on behalf of Canada in connection with the Work 
       and all information developed by the Contractor as part of the Work, 
       title to which vests in Canada under the Contract, and shall not 
       disclose any such information to any person without the written 
       permission of the Minister, except that the Contractor may disclose 
       to a Subcontractor authorized in accordance with section 7 
       (Subcontracting) information necessary to the performance of the 
       Subcontract.  This subsection does not apply to any information 
       where the same information:

       (a)    is publicly available from a source other than the Contractor; 
              or

       (b)    is or becomes known to the Contractor from a source other 
              than Canada, except any source that is known to the 
              Contractor to be under an obligation to Canada not to 
              disclose the information.

(2)    When the Contract, the Work, or any information referred to in 
       subsection (1) is identified as "Top Secret", "Secret", "
       Confidential", or "Protected" by Canada, the Contractor shall at all 
       times take all measures reasonably necessary for the safeguarding of 
       the material so identified, including those set out in the DSS 
       Industrial Security Manual and its supplements and any other 
       instructions issued by the Minister.

(3)    Without limiting the generality of subsections (1) and (2), when the 
       Contract, the Work, or any information referred to in subsection (1) 
       is identified as "Top Secret", "Secret", "Confidential", or "
       Protected" by Canada, the Minister shall be entitled to inspect the 
       Contractor's premises and the premises of a subcontractor at any 
       tier for security purposes at any time during the term of the 
       Contract, and the Contractor shall comply with, and ensure that any 
       such subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by 
       the Minister dealing with the material so identified, including any 
       requirement that employees of the Contractor or of any such 
       subcontractor execute and deliver declarations relating to 
       reliability screenings, security clearances and other procedures.

(4)    Any proposed change in the security requirements after the effective 
       date of the Contract that would involve a significant increase in 
       Cost to the Contractor shall require an amendment to the Contract 
       under the provisions of section 4 (Amendments and Waivers).


<strong>9676   13     (04/01/94)    Payment</strong>


(1)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Contract, no payment 
       shall be made to the Contractor unless and until:

       (a)    an invoice, inspection notes, certificates and any other 
              documents required by the Contract have been submitted in 
              accordance with the terms of the Contract and the 
              instructions of the Minister;

       (b)    all such documents have been verified by the Minister;

       (c)    with respect to all parts of the Work in respect of which 
              payment is claimed, the Contractor, where required to do so, 
              establishes to the satisfaction of the Minister that such 
              parts of the Work will be free from all claims, liens, 
              attachments, charges or encumbrances; and

       (d)    in the case of payment in respect of finished Work, the 
              finished Work has been inspected by Canada and accepted as 
              being in accordance with the Contract, including the 
              Specifications.

(2)    The Minister shall notify the Contractor, within 15 days of receipt 
       of an invoice, of any inadequacy of the invoice or of the supporting 
       documentation, and where any such notice is given within that period 
       the date for payment of the amount invoiced shall be postponed until 
       the Contractor remedies the inadequacy to the satisfaction of the 
       Minister.

(3)    Where a delay referred to in section 11 (Excusable Delay) has 
       occurred, the Minister may, at the Minister's discretion, withhold 
       all or a portion of any payment due to the Contractor until a 
       "work-around" plan approved by the Minister has been implemented in 
       accordance with that section.  Section 14 (Interest on Overdue 
       Accounts) shall not apply to any amount withheld under this 
       subsection. 


<strong>9676   14     (04/01/94)    Interest on Overdue Accounts</strong>

       "<strong>Bank Rate</strong>" means the discount rate of interest per annum set by the 
       Bank of Canada;

       "<strong>date of payment</strong>" means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn 
       by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an 
       amount due and payable;

       an amount is "<strong>due and payable</strong>" when it is due and payable by Canada 
       to the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract; and

       an amount becomes "<strong>overdue</strong>" when it is unpaid on the first day 
       following the day upon which it is due and payable. 
(2)    Subject to the Contract, Canada shall be liable to pay to the 
       Contractor simple interest at the Bank Rate plus 1 1/4 percent per 
       annum on any amount that is overdue, from the date such amount 
       becomes overdue until the day prior to the date of payment, 
       inclusive. Interest shall be paid without notice from the Contractor, 
       but will only be paid if the amount has been overdue more than 15 
       days.  Canada shall not be liable to pay interest on overdue advance 
       payments.

(3)    The Bank Rate shall be that prevailing at the opening of business on 
       the date of payment.

(4)    Canada shall not be liable to pay interest in accordance with this

<strong>9676   15     (04/01/94)    Changes in Taxes and Duties</strong>


(1)    In this section, "bid" includes a proposal, tender or offer 
       submitted by the Contractor in response to an invitation from the 
       Minister.

(2)    Subject to subsection (3), in the event of any change (including a 
       new imposition or repeal), on or after the date of submission of the 
       bid, of any tax, customs or other duty, charge, or any similar 
       imposition that is imposed under sales or excise tax legislation of 
       the Government of Canada and which affects the Cost to the 
       Contractor of the Work, the Contract Price shall be adjusted to 
       reflect the increase or decrease in the Cost to the Contractor.

(3)    There shall be no adjustment under subsection (2) in respect of any 
       change that would increase the Cost to the Contractor of the Work if 
       public notice of the change was given before the bid submission date 
       in sufficient detail to permit the Contractor to have calculated the 
       effect on its Cost before that date.

(4)    The Contractor shall forward to the Minister a certified statement 
       showing the increase or decrease in Cost to the Contractor that is 
       directly attributable to the change in the imposition.  The Minister 
       may verify the increase or decrease in Cost by audit before or after 
       the Contract Price is adjusted.

(5)    Notwithstanding subsections (2) to (4), no adjustment to the 
       Contract Price in respect of the Work or a part thereof shall be 
       made for a change in any imposition referred to in this section that 
       occurs after the date required by the Contract for delivery of the 
       Work or that part of the Work.


<strong>9676   16     (04/01/94)    Inspection of the Work</strong>

as the Technical or Inspection Authority determines to be appropriate, 
consistent with the relevant provisions of the Contract, if any, prior to 
acceptance by Canada. The Contracting Authority and the Technical or 
Inspection Authority, or their representatives, shall have access to the 
Work at any time during working hours where any part of the Work is being 
carried out and may make examinations and such tests of the Work as they 
may think fit.  Should the Work or any part thereof not be in accordance 
with the requirements of the Contract, the Technical or Inspection 
Authority shall have the right to reject the Work and require its 
correction or replacement at the Contractor's expense.  The Technical or 
Inspection Authority shall inform the Contractor of the reasons for any 
such rejection.  Inspection by the Technical or Inspection Authority shall 
not relieve the Contractor from responsibility to meet the requirements of 
the Contract.

       or any portion of the Work, either by way of progress payments or 
       accountable advances or otherwise, title to the Work so paid for 
       shall vest in and remain in Canada unless already so vested under 
       any other provision of the Contract.

(3)    Notwithstanding any vesting of title referred to in this section and 
       except as otherwise provided in the Contract, the risk of loss or 
       damage to the Work or part thereof so vested shall remain with the 
       Contractor until its delivery to Canada in accordance with the 
       Contract.

(4)    Any vesting of title referred to in subsection (2) shall not 
       constitute acceptance by Canada of the Work and shall not relieve 
       the Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in accordance 
       with the Contract.

(5)    If the Contract is a defence contract within the meaning of the <em>
       Defence Production Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. D-1, title to the Work or to 
       any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished Work shall vest in 
       Canada free and clear of all claims, liens, attachments, charges or 
       encumbrances, and the Minister shall be entitled at any time to 
       remove, sell or dispose of it or any part of it in accordance with 
       section 20 of that Act.

       Government Property while the same is in, on, or about the plant and 
       premises of the Contractor or otherwise in its possession or subject

       resulting from its failure to do so other than loss or damage caused 
       by ordinary wear and tear.

(3)    All Government Property, except such as is installed or incorporated 
       into the Work, shall, unless otherwise specifically provided in the 
       Contract, be returned to Canada on demand.

       Minister and their servants and agents from and against any damages,

              section to the extent that the injury, loss or damage has 
              been caused by Canada, and
 
       (b)    any liens, attachments, charges or other encumbrances or 
              claims upon or in respect of any materials, parts, 
              work-in-process or finished Work furnished to, or in respect 
              of which any payment has been made by, Canada.

(2)    The Minister shall give notice to the Contractor of any claim, 
       action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsection (1) and the

       indemnify Canada for payment of any settlement unless it has

(3)    Canada shall indemnify and save harmless the Contractor and its 
       servants and agents against any claim, action, suit or other

       or might result in further or different payments by way of Royalties

       developed by the Contractor as part of the Work under the Contract, 
       and in which copyright subsists, but does not include computer 
       programs and related software documentation.

(2)    Copyright in the Material shall vest in Canada and the Contractor

<strong>9676   22     (04/01/94)    Suspension of the Work</strong>


(1)    The Minister may at any time, by written notice, order the 
       Contractor to suspend or stop all or part of the Work under the 
       Contract for a period of up to 180 days.  The Contractor shall 
       immediately comply with any such order in the manner that minimizes 
       the cost of so doing.  While such an order is in effect, the 
       Contractor shall not remove any part of the Work from any premises 
       without the prior written consent of the Contracting Authority. At 
       any time prior to the expiration of the 180 days, the Minister shall 
       either rescind the order or terminate the Contract, in whole or in 
       part, under section 23 (Default by the Contractor) or section 24 
       (Termination for Convenience).

(2)    When an order is made under subsection (1), unless the Minister 
       terminates the Contract by reason of default by the Contractor or 
       the Contractor abandons the Contract, the Contractor shall be 
       entitled to be paid its additional Costs incurred as a result of the 
       suspension plus a fair and reasonable profit thereon.

(3)    When an order is made under subsection (1) and is rescinded:

       (a)    the Contractor shall as soon as practicable resume Work in 
              accordance with the Contract;

       (b)    if the suspension has affected the Contractor's ability to 
              meet any delivery date under the Contract, the date for the 
              performance of that part of the Work affected by the 
              suspension shall be extended for a period equal to the period 
              of suspension plus a period, if any, which in the opinion of 
              the Minister following consultation with the Contractor is 
              reasonably necessary for the Contractor to resume the Work; 
              and

       (c)    subject to section 4 (Amendments and Waivers), an equitable 
              adjustment shall be made as necessary to affected terms and 
              conditions of the Contract.


<strong>9676   23     (04/01/94)    Default by the Contractor</strong>


(1)    Where the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its 
       obligations under the Contract, the Minister may, upon giving 
       written notice to the Contractor, terminate for default the whole or 
       any part of the Contract, either immediately, or at the expiration 
       of a cure period specified in the notice if the Contractor has not 
       cured the default to the satisfaction of the Minister within that 
       cure period.

(2)    Where the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an 
       assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit of any 
       statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or where a 
       receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a receiving order 
       is made against the Contractor, or an order is made or a resolution 
       passed for the winding up of the Contractor, the Minister may, to 
       the extent permitted by the laws of Canada, upon giving notice to 
       the Contractor, immediately terminate for default the whole or any 
       part of the Contract.

(3)    Upon the giving of a notice provided for in subsection (1) or (2), 
       the Contractor shall have no claim for further payment other than as 
       provided in this section, but shall be liable to Canada for any 
       amounts, including milestone payments, paid by Canada and for all 
       losses and damages which may be suffered by Canada by reason of the 
       default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including any 
       increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work from 
       another source.  The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to 
       Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at 
       the date of the termination.  Nothing in this section affects any 
       obligation of Canada under the law to mitigate damages.

(4)    Upon termination of the Contract under this section, the Minister 
       may require the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the Minister, any completed parts of the 
       Work which have not been delivered and accepted prior to the 
       termination and any material, equipment or work-in-process which the 
       Contractor has acquired or produced specifically in the fulfilment 
       of the Contract.

(5)    Subject to the deduction of any claim that Canada may have against 
       the Contractor arising under the Contract or out of the termination, 
       Canada shall pay or credit to the Contractor the value, determined 
       on the basis of the Contract Price including the proportionate part 
       of the Contractor's profit or fee included in the Contract Price, of 
       all completed parts of the Work delivered to Canada pursuant to a 
       direction under subsection (4) and accepted by Canada, and shall pay 
       or credit to the Contractor the Cost to the Contractor that the 
       Minister considers reasonable in respect of all material, equipment 
       or work-in-process delivered to Canada pursuant to a direction under 
       subsection (4) and accepted by Canada, but in no event shall the 
       aggregate of the amounts paid by Canada under the Contract to the 
       date of termination and any amounts payable pursuant to this 
       subsection exceed the Contract Price.

(6)    Title to all material, equipment, work-in-process and finished Work 
       in respect of which payment is made to the Contractor shall, upon 
       such payment being made, pass to and vest in Canada unless already 
       so vested under any other provision of the Contract, and such 
       material, equipment, work-in-process and finished Work shall be 
       delivered according to the order of the Minister, but Canada will 
       not accept and will not pay for material, equipment or 
       work-in-process that would not have been required to perform the 
       Work or that exceed what would have been required to perform the 
       Work.

(7)    Where, subsequent to issuance of a notice pursuant to subsection (1), 
       the Minister is satisfied that grounds did not exist for a 
       termination under this section, the notice shall be deemed a notice 
       of termination for convenience issued under subsection 24(1) 
       (Termination for Convenience).


<strong>9676   24     (04/01/94)    Termination for Convenience</strong>


(1)    Notwithstanding anything contained in the Contract, the Minister may, 
       at any time prior to the completion of the Work, by giving notice to 
       the Contractor (in this section sometimes referred to as a "
       termination notice"), terminate the Contract as regards all or any 
       part of the Work not completed.  Upon a termination notice being 
       given, the Contractor shall cease work in accordance with and to the 
       extent specified in the notice, but shall proceed to complete such 
       part or parts of the Work as are not affected by the termination 
       notice.  The Minister may, at any time or from time to time, give 
       one or more additional termination notices with respect to any or 
       all parts of the Work not terminated by any previous termination 
       notice.

(2)    In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to 
       subsection (1), the Contractor shall be entitled to be paid, to the 
       extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for 
       purposes of performing the Contract and to the extent that the 
       Contractor has not already been so paid or reimbursed by Canada 
       including the unliquidated portion of any advance payment:

       (a)    on the basis of the Contract Price, for all completed Work 
              that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the 
              Contract, whether completed before, or after and in 
              compliance with the instructions contained in, the 
              termination notice; 

       (b)    the cost to the Contractor plus a fair and reasonable profit 
              thereon, for all Work terminated by the termination notice 
              before completion, the cost to the Contractor being 
              determined in accordance with the terms of the Contract and 
              with Contract Cost Principles DSS-MAS 1031-2;

       (c)    the amount of any capital expenditures actually incurred only 
              if they were specifically authorized under the Contract or 
              approved in writing by the Minister for the purpose of the 
              Contract, less any depreciation in respect thereof already 
              taken into account in determining Cost, to the extent that 
              the capital expenditures are properly apportionable to the 
              performance of the Contract;

       (d)    all Costs of and incidental to the termination of the Work or 
              part thereof, including the Cost of cancellation of 
              obligations incurred by the Contractor with respect to the 
              terminated Work or part thereof, the Cost of and incidental 
              to the taking of an inventory of materials, components, 
              work-in-process and finished Work on hand related to the 
              Contract at the date of the termination, and the Cost of 
              preparation of necessary accounts and statements with respect 
              to Work performed to the effective date of the termination 
              and commitments made by the Contractor with respect to the 
              terminated portions of the Work; but not including the cost 
              of severance payments or damages to employees whose services 
              are no longer required by reason of the termination except 
              wages that the Contractor is obligated by statute to pay them 
              and except for reasonable severance payments or damages paid 
              to employees hired to perform the Contract whose hiring was 
              expressly required by the Contract or approved in writing by 
              the Minister for the purpose of the Contract.

(3)    In paragraph (2)(c), "capital expenditures" includes the entry into 
       leases of real property and equipment.

(4)    The Minister may reduce the payment in respect of any of the Work to 
       the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in meeting the 
       requirements of the Contract.

(5)    Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2), the total of the amounts 
       to which the Contractor is entitled under paragraphs (2)(a) to (c) 
       inclusive, together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to 
       the Contractor under other provisions of the Contract, shall not 
       exceed the Contract Price or the portion thereof that is applicable 
       to the part of the Work that is terminated, and shall not exceed the 
       proportion of the price quoted by the Contractor for all of the Work 
       that is reasonably attributable to the proportion of the Work 
       performed to the effective date of the termination.

(6)    In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the Contract and in the subcontracting of any of the Work, the 
       Contractor shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Minister, place 
       purchase orders and Subcontracts on terms that will enable the
