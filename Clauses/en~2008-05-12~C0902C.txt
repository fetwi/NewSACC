<pre>1.     <strong>Price Breakdown</strong>:

       The Contractor must, upon request, provide a price breakdown for all 
       unscheduled work, by specific activities with trades, person-hours, 
       material, subcontracts and services.

2.     <strong>Pro-rated Prices</strong>:

       Hours and prices for unscheduled work will be based on comparable 
       historical data applicable to similar work at the same facility, or 
       will be determined by pro-rating the quoted work costs in the 
       Contract when in similar areas of the vessel.

3.     <strong>Payment for Unscheduled Work</strong>:

              The Contractor will be paid for unscheduled work arising, as 
       authorized by Canada.  The authorized unscheduled work will be 
       calculated as follows:

              Number of hours (to be negotiated) X $_____, being the 
       Contractor's firm hourly charge-out labour rate which includes 
       overhead and profit, plus net laid-down cost of materials to which 
       will be added a mark-up of 10 percent, plus Goods and Services Tax 
       or Harmonized Sales Tax, if applicable, calculated at ____ percent 
       of the total cost of material and labour. The firm hourly charge-out 
       labour rate and the material mark-up will remain firm for the 
       duration of the Contract and any subsequent amendments.
