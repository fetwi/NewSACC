shall furnish such particulars thereof as the Minister may require. The 
contract shall not be assigned nor any of the work sublet without the prior

contract or the Minister directs otherwise, the Contractor may sublet such

(4) The Minister may, on request, furnish to any subcontractor evidence of 
the amounts submitted by the Contractor on the subcontractor's account.

deducted from the gross cost thereof all trade discounts, rebates, 
refundable taxes and duties, credits, commissions and other allowances as 
aforesaid.  Such benefits lost through no fault or neglect on the part of

shall be submitted for acceptance or shall be delivered unless or until

think fit. The Contractor shall provide all assistance and facilities, test 
pieces and samples which the Minister or the Inspector may reasonably 
require for the carrying out of any such inspections and any such tests as 
aforesaid and shall forward such test pieces and samples to such person or 
location as the Minister or the Inspector may direct.  The Contractor shall 
provide the Minister and the Inspector with such accommodation as they may 
require for the purpose of such inspections and any such tests and for the

<strong>06/91</strong>

All specifications, drawings, patterns, samples and other information 
furnished the Contractor in connection with the contract shall be used by

Minister upon demand.  

<strong>1026B  07     Inspection</strong>

otherwise not be in accordance with the requirements of the contract, the 
Inspector shall have the right to reject the work or to require its 
correction.  Inspection by the Inspector either at the plant of the 
Contractor or of any of its subcontractors shall not relieve the Contractor 
from responsibility for defects or other failure to meet the requirements 
of the contract.  The Contractor agrees to accept and be bound by the 
Inspector's interpretation of the meaning of the specifications.  

<strong>1026B  08     Title and Acceptance</strong>

Majesty. 
 
<strong>1026B  09     Warranty</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

Notwithstanding prior acceptance of the finished work, and without 
restricting any other term of the contract or any condition, warranty or 
provision implied or imposed by law, the Contractor, if requested by the 
Minister to do so at any time within 12 months from the date of delivery, 
shall:

       (a) replace or make good at its own expense any finished work, 
       excluding Government Issue incorporated therein, which becomes 
       defective or which fails to conform to contract requirements as a 
       result of faulty or inefficient manufacture, material or workmanship

       (b) deliver such finished work free from all defects to the delivery 
       point specified in the contract, unless otherwise agreed to by the 
       Minister;

provided that where, in the opinion of the Minister, it is not expedient to 
remove such defective finished work from its location, the Contractor shall 
replace or make good the defective finished work at such location, and 
shall be paid the actual cost incurred in so doing (including reasonable 
travelling and living expenses) with no allowance thereon by way of 
overhead or profit, less a sum equivalent to the cost of making good the 
defective finished work had it been made good at the Contractor's plant. 

<strong>1026B  10     Government Issue</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) All items comprised in any Government Issue shall be used by the 
Contractor solely for the purposes of the contract and shall always be and 
remain the property of Her Majesty and wherever feasible the Contractor

(3) All scrap and waste materials derived from any Government Issue or from 
any other materials, articles or things which are the property of Her 
Majesty, shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, remain the 
property of Her Majesty and shall be disposed of only as prescribed by the 
Minister. 
 
<strong>1026B  11     Spoilage and Defective Work</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

The Contractor shall carry out the work as economically as possible and 
shall avoid waste and spoilage. If the character and value of any spoiled 
and wasted materials, or defective work, in the opinion of the Minister 
constitutes mismanagement on the part of the Contractor, the cost of the 
spoiled and wasted materials and the cost of re-working the defective work 
to the extent directed by the Minister shall not be considered as part of 
the cost of the work and the Contractor shall not be reimbursed therefor. 

<strong>1026B  12     Care of Crown Property</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

Except as otherwise provided in the contract, no insurance shall be carried 
by the Contractor on any property, title to which is vested in Her Majesty,

property of Her Majesty.  The Contractor shall take reasonable and proper 
care of all property, title to which is vested in Her Majesty, while the 
same is in, on or about the plant and premises of the Contractor or 
otherwise in his possession or subject to his control and shall be 
responsible for any loss or damage resulting from his failure to do so 
other than loss or damage caused by fire or by ordinary wear and tear. 

<strong>1026B  13     Time of Essence</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

Time shall be deemed to be of the essence of the contract provided that the 
time for completing any of the work which has been or is likely to be 
delayed by reason of force majeure or other cause beyond the reasonable 
control of the Contractor shall be extended by a period equal to the length 
of the delay so caused, provided that prompt notice in writing of the 
occurrence causing or likely to cause such delay is given to the Minister.  

<strong>1026B  14     Accounts</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

The Contractor shall keep proper accounts and records of the cost to the 
Contractor of the work and of all expenditures or commitments made by the 
Contractor in connection therewith and such accounts and records together 
with the related invoices, receipts and vouchers shall be open to audit and 
inspection by the authorized representatives of the Minister (who may make 
copies thereof and take extracts therefrom) at any time until the 
expiration of six (6) years from the end of the calendar year in which the 
contract is terminated or completed and the Contractor shall afford all 
facilities for such audits and inspections and shall furnish the Minister 
and his authorized representatives with all such information as he or they 
may from time to time require with reference to such accounts, records, 
invoices, receipts and vouchers.  The Contractor shall not, without the 
consent of the Minister, dispose of any such accounts, records, invoices, 
receipts and vouchers until the expiration of six (6) years from the end of

and all claims or arrangements made or proposed which would or might result 
in further or different payments by way of royalties being made by the 
Contractor or any of its subcontractors.

(5) If and to the extent that the Minister so directs, the Contractor shall 
not pay, and shall direct its subcontractors not to pay any royalties in 
respect of the carrying out of the contract except with the consent in

impose.

(6) From and after the giving of any such direction, and subject to

       loss of or damage to property of others which may be or be alleged 
       to be caused by or suffered as a result of the carrying out of the 
       work or any part thereof, and

       (b) any liens, attachments, charges or other encumbrances or claims

materials, parts, work in process and finished work so paid for by such 
progress payments or accountable advances or otherwise shall vest and 
remain in Her Majesty, unless already so vested under any provision of the 
contract, and the Contractor shall be responsible therefor in accordance 
with the provisions of section 12 hereof, it being understood and agreed 
that such vesting of title in Her Majesty shall not constitute acceptance 
by Her Majesty of such materials, parts, work in process and finished work 
and shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations to perform the work 
in conformity with the requirements of the contract.  

<strong>1026B  22     Further Assurances</strong>
<strong>06/91</strong>

Wherever it is herein provided that title to any parts, materials, work in 
process or finished work becomes vested in Her Majesty, the Contractor

additions to the specifications, changes in methods of shipment or packing 
and in the place or time of delivery. All directions given by the Minister 
with respect to the foregoing shall be complied with by the Contractor.

payment of any fee or any portion thereof with respect to any of the work 
not completed by the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the 
contract at the time of the said notice in writing to the Contractor.

(2) If after notice of termination of the contract under the provisions of 
subsection (1) of this section, it is determined by the Minister that the 
default of the Contractor is due to causes beyond the control of the

pursuant to section 25 (Termination) of these general conditions, and the 
rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by that 
section.

Contractor of all materials, parts or work in process delivered to Her 
Majesty pursuant to such direction.

<strong>06/91</strong>

(1) Notwithstanding anything in the contract contained, the Minister may, 
by giving notice to the Contractor, terminate the contract as regards all 
or any part or parts of the work not theretofore completed. Upon such 
notice being given, the Contractor shall cease work (including the 
manufacturing and procuring of materials for the fulfilment of the contract) 
in accordance with and to the extent specified in such notice but shall 
proceed with all reasonable speed to complete such part or parts (if any) 
of the work as are by the terms of such notice to be completed and shall 
also proceed with all reasonable speed to complete up to such time or stage 
as may be specified in the notice any part or parts of the work as required 
by such notice.  Furthermore, the Minister may, at any time or from time to 
time, give one or more additional notices with respect to any or all parts 
of the work which remain to be completed after the giving of any previous 
notice or notices.

(2) In the event of any notice given under the provisions of this section, 
and subject as hereinafter provided:

       (a) All work completed by the Contractor hereunder before the giving 
       of such notice, and all work completed thereafter pursuant to such 
       notice, shall be paid for (subject to inspection and acceptance by 
       Her Majesty) in accordance with the terms hereof;

       (b) In respect of work not completed hereunder before the giving of 
       such notice, and not completed thereafter pursuant to such notice, 
       Her Majesty shall pay the Contractor's cost thereof as determined 
       under the provision hereof, and in addition an amount representing a 
       fair and reasonable profit in respect of work done thereon;

       (c) Subject as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection 2, if 
       the contract shall have specifically authorized or if the Minister 
       shall have specifically approved the making of capital expenditures 
       by the Contractor to enable it to carry out the contract, the 
       Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed the amount of such 
       capital expenditures so authorized or approved (and actually made or 
       incurred) to the extent that the same (less any depreciation in 
       respect thereof already taken into account in determining cost in 
       accordance with the provisions of the contract) were reasonably and 
       properly incurred by the Contractor in respect of and are properly 
       apportionable to the performance of the contract;

       (d) If the contract is exclusively a contract for the making of 
       capital expenditures in respect of additional equipment or plant 
       additions, the foregoing paragraphs (a) to (c) inclusive of this 
       subsection (2) shall not apply, but Her Majesty shall pay or 
       reimburse the Contractor for the reasonable and proper cost to the

by the circumstances.
