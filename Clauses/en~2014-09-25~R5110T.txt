<h2>GI01	 (2014-09-25) Integrity Provisions - Bid</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bidders must comply with the <cite><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">Code of Conduct for Procurement</a></cite>. In addition, bidders must respond to bid solicitations in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the bid solicitations and resulting contracts, and submit bids as well as enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.</li>
<li value="2">By submitting a bid, bidders confirm that they understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications is found by Canada to be untrue in any respect, at the time of contract award. If it is determined, after contract award, that the Bidder made a false declaration, Canada will, following a notice period, have the right to terminate the Contract for default. The Bidder will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information requested. The Bidder and any of the Bidder's Affiliates will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions during the period of any contract resulting from this bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="3"><dfn>Affiliates</dfn><br/>
For the purpose of these Integrity Provisions, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies, and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals, and directors, are Bidder's Affiliates if:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>

Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.</li>
<li value="4">Bidders who are incorporated, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Bidder. Bidders bidding as sole proprietorship, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide the name of the owner. Bidders bidding as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.<br/>

If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of bids is completed, Canada will inform the Bidder of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to provide the names within the time frame specified will render the bid non-responsive. Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for contract award.<br/>

Canada may, at any time, request that the Bidder provide properly completed and signed consent forms (<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/forms/formulaires-forms-eng.html#f229" rel="external">Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229</a>) for any or all individuals mentioned above within a specified time. Failure to provide such consent forms and associated information within the time frame provided, or failure to cooperate to the verification process, will result in the bid being declared non-responsive.</li>
<li value="5">The Bidder must diligently inform Canada in writing of any change affecting the list of names of directors during this procurement process as well as during the contract period. The Bidder must also, when requested, provide Canada with properly completed and signed consent forms.</li>
<li value="6">By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that it is aware, and that its Affiliates are aware, that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility. Canada may also verify the information provided by the Bidder, including the information relating to the acts or convictions and any conditional or absolute discharges specified in these Integrity Provisions, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="7">	By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that neither the Bidder nor any of the Bidder's Affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Contract if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-12.4/" rel="external">Lobbying Act</a></cite>.</li>
<li value="8"><dfn>Time Period</dfn><br/>
The Time Period is 10 years and is measured from the date of the conviction or from the date of the conditional or absolute discharge.<br/>

In addition, for a conviction under paragraphs a. or b. of subsection 9, following the 10-year period, a criminal pardon or a record suspension must have been obtained, or capacities must have been restored by the Governor in Council. The Bidder must therefore provide with its bid or promptly afterwards a copy of confirming documentation from an official source for its certification to be found true by Canada for the purpose of these Integrity Provisions. If the documentation has not been received by the time the evaluation of bids is completed, Canada will inform the Bidder of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to comply within the time frame specified will render the bid non-responsive.</li>
<li value="9">By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that neither the Bidder nor any of the Bidder’s Affiliates have been convicted of an offence or received a conditional or an absolute discharge under any of the following provisions, unless the time period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, has elapsed:

<li value="5">section 239 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Act</a></cite>, or</li>
<li value="6">section 327 (<em>False or deceptive statements</em>) of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-15/" rel="external">Excise Tax Act</a></cite>, or</li>
<li value="7">section 3 (<em>Bribing a foreign public official</em>), section 4 (<em>Accounting</em>), or section 5 (<em>Offence committed outside Canada</em>) of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-45.2/" rel="external">Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act</a></cite>, or</li>
<li value="8">section 5 (<em>Trafficking in substance</em>), section 6 (<em>Importing and exporting</em>), or section 7 (<em>Production of substance</em>) of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/" rel="external">Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</a></cite>.</li>
</ol>

The Bidder also certifies that no one convicted under any of the provisions under a. or b. are to receive any benefit under a contract arising from this bid solicitation, unless a pardon or a record suspension has been obtained or capacities restored by the Governor in Council, as defined in the Time Period subsection.</li>

The Bidder also certifies that, within a period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, neither the Bidder nor any of the Bidder’s Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge, under any foreign offence that Canada deems to be of similar constitutive elements to the offences listed in these Integrity Provisions. Canada will also consider foreign measures declared by Canada to be similar in nature to the Canadian pardon, record suspension, or restoration of capacities by the Governor in Council.</li>
<li value="11"><dfn>Subcontractors</dfn><br/>
The Bidder must ensure that subcontracts include Integrity Provisions no less favourable to Canada than those imposed in the resulting contract.</li>
<li value="12"><dfn>Preventive measures associated with the Time Period</dfn><br/>
In cases where the period, as defined in the Time Period subsection, for a conviction, or a conditional or an absolute discharge of the Bidder or any of the Bidder’s Affiliates has elapsed, then the Bidder must also certify for itself and for its Affiliates that measures have been diligently put in place in order to avoid the reoccurrence of such convictions or reprehensible actions.</li>
<li value="13"><dfn>Public Interest Exception</dfn><br/>
Bidders understand that Canada may enter into contract with a bidder, where the Bidder or the Bidder’s Affiliates have been convicted of or have received a conditional or an absolute discharge for an offence specified in these Integrity Provisions, when required to do so by law or legal proceedings, or when Canada in its sole discretion considers it necessary to the public interest for reasons which include, but are not limited to:


<ul>
<li>no one else is capable of performing the contract;</li>
<li>emergency;</li>
<li>national security;</li>
<li>health and safety;</li>
<li>economic harm.</li>
</ul>


If all bids are found non-responsive for reason of a listed relevant conviction or act, then Canada may invoke the public interest exception, as described in the paragraph above. In such cases, only bids containing a declaration concerning a relevant offence or act will be further considered. Canada may also elect to procure outside of the present process. In all cases, Canada reserves the right to impose additional conditions or measures to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.</li>
<li value="14"><dfn>Non-application</dfn><br/>
For governments, as well as entities controlled by a government, including Crown corporations, the present Integrity Provisions are reduced to complying with article 750 of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/" rel="external">Criminal Code</a></cite>, the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/" rel="external">Government Contracts Regulations</a></cite> and the <cite><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">Code of Conduct for Procurement</a></cite>.</li>

<h2>GI16 (2012-07-16) Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>

following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of
interest;</li>

their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available
to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or
appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing
or has provided the goods and services described in the bid
solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be

a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the criteria established
above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and
provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that
it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to
have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within
Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of
interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest
or unfair advantage exists.</li>
