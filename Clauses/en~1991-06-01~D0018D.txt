<pre>Delivery trucks must be equipped with an unloading device which will permit 
unloading at plants with no hydraulic, stationary or other type of 
unloading facility.

When making deliveries, sufficient personnel must be provided to permit 
unloading of any type of vehicle without the assistance of Printing 
Operations Personnel.

At some Outside plants, the delivery vehicle must be unloaded while parked 
   at the curb. When material is placed on the sidewalk, it must be placed 
   in proximity to the designated entrance so as to be readily accessible 
   to transport by mechanical handling equipment utilized by plant 
   personnel.
