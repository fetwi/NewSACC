<pre>1.     If the Contractor is in default in fulfilling any of the terms, 
       conditions, covenants or obligations of the Contract, or has made a 
       false representation or warranty, Canada may, by giving notice in 
       writing to the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of the 
       Contract. On the giving of such notice, the Contractor shall have no 
       claim for any further payment under the Contract.

2.     If after notice of termination of the Contract under the provisions 
       of paragraph 1 of this clause, it is determined by Canada that the 
       default of the Contractor is due to causes beyond the control of the 
       Contractor, such notice of termination shall be deemed to have been 
       issued pursuant to section 9 (Termination) of General Conditions  
       Universities and Other Institutions, DSSMAS 1053, and the rights and 
       obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by that section.

3.     On termination of the Contract under this clause, Canada may require 
   the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and to the extent 
   directed by Canada, any work which has not been delivered/performed and 
   accepted prior to such termination.  Subject to the deduction of any 
   claim which Canada may have against the Contractor arising under the 
   Contract or out of the termination, Canada shall pay the Contractor for 
   all such work delivered/performed pursuant to such direction and 
   accepted by Canada, the cost to the Contractor of such work plus the 
   proportionate part of any profit fixed by the said Contract and shall 
   pay or reimburse the Contractor the reasonable and proper costs to the 
   Contractor of all materials, parts or work in process delivered to 
   Canada pursuant to such direction, but in no event shall the aggregate 
   of the price paid to date of default and any amounts otherwise payable 
   pursuant to this paragraph 3 exceed the total Contract Price.
