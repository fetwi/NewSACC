<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-38.2/" rel="external">Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</a></cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr>16, the clauses and conditions
identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="status-of-the-contractor">2029 03 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent Contractor engaged by Canada
to perform the Work. Neither the Contractor nor any of its
personnel is engaged as an employee, servant or agent of Canada.
The Contractor is responsible for all deductions and remittances
required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2 id="condition-of-material">2029 04 (2008-05-12) Condition of material</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, material supplied
must be new and conform to the latest issue of the applicable
drawing, specification and part number that is in effect on the bid
solicitation closing date or, if there was no bid solicitation, the
date of the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="inspection-acceptance-warranty">2029 05 (2014-09-25) Inspection, acceptance and warranty</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contractor must perform the Work efficiently in
accordance with standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in
full conformity with all the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li>All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance
by Canada. Despite inspection and acceptance of the Work by or on
behalf of Canada and without restricting any provisions of the
Contract or any condition, warranty or provision imposed by law,
the Contractor, if requested by Canada to do so, must replace,
repair or correct, at its own option and expense any work that
becomes defective or fails to conform to the requirements of the
Contract, where applicable. For goods, the warranty period will be
12 months after delivery and acceptance of the Work or the
length of the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty
period, whichever is longer.</li>
<li>Canada must pay the transportation cost associated
with returning the Work or any part of the Work to the Contractor's
plant for replacement, repair or making good, and the Contractor
must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the
replacement or returning the Work or part of the Work when
rectified to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to
another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of
Canada, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location,
the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good
of the Work at that location and will be reimbursed its reasonable
travel and living expenses.</li>
<li>The warranty period is automatically extended by the
duration of any period or periods where the Work is unavailable for
use or cannot be used because of a defect or non-conformance during
the original warranty period. The warranty applies to any part of
the Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to subsection 2,
for the greater of:
<ol type="a">
<li>the warranty period remaining, including the
extension, or</li>
<li>90 days or such other period as may be
specified for that purpose by agreement between the Parties.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="invoice-submission">2029 06 (2013-03-21) Invoice submission</h2>
<ol>
<li>Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name.
The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment;
invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must
indicate whether it covers partial of final delivery.</li>
<li>Invoices must show:
<ol type="a">
<li>the date, the name and address of the client
department, item or reference numbers, deliverable/description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number
(CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial
code(s);</li>
<li>details of expenditures (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as applicable) in accordance with the Basis of Payment, exclusive of Applicable Taxes;</li>
<li>deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li>the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li>if applicable, the method of shipment together with
date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Applicable Taxes must be specified on all invoices as a separate item along with corresponding registration numbers from the tax authorities. All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which Applicable Taxes do not apply, must be identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li>By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taxes">2029 07 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes.
</li>
<li>
Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation. The Contractor agrees to remit to appropriate tax authorities any amounts of Applicable Taxes paid or due.
</li>
<li>
The Contractor is not entitled to use Canada’s exemptions from any tax, such as provincial sales taxes, unless otherwise specified by law. The Contractor must pay applicable provincial sales tax, ancillary taxes, and any commodity tax, on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with applicable legislation), including for material incorporated into real property. 
</li>
<li>
In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award. However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change.

<li>Tax Withholding of 15 Percent – Canada Revenue Agency 
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Act</a></cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Regulations</a></cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html" rel="external">Canada Revenue Agency</a></cite>. The amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.
</p>
<h2 id="transportation-costs">2029 08 (2010-01-11) Transportation costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-carrier-liability">2029 09 (2010-01-11) Transportation carriers' liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
shipment.</p>
<h2 id="shipment-documentation">2029 10 (2008-05-12) Shipment documentation</h2>
<p>For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading
must accompany the original invoice, except for "collect" shipments
(if and when stipulated), in which event it must accompany the
shipment. In addition, a packing slip must accompany each shipment,
showing item, quantity, part or reference numbers, description of
the goods and contract number, including the <abbr title="Client Reference Number">CRN</abbr> and <abbr title="Procurement Business Number">PBN</abbr>. If the
goods have been inspected at the Contractor's plant, the signed
inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally
enclosed in the packing note envelope.</p>
<h2 id="payment-period">2029 11 (2014-09-25) Payment period</h2>
<ol>
<li>Canada's standard payment period is 30 days.
The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
considered overdue on the 31st day following that date and interest
will be paid automatically in accordance with section 12.</li>
<li>If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
15 days will only result in the date specified in
subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interest-on-overdue-accounts">2029 12 (2008-12-12) Interest on overdue accounts</h2>

following the day on which it is due and payable according to the
Contract.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Canada will pay the Contractor simple interest at the
Average Rate plus 3 percent per year on any amount that is overdue,
from the date that amount becomes overdue until the day before the
date of payment, inclusive. The Contractor is not required to
provide notice to Canada for interest to be payable.</li>
<li>Canada will pay interest in accordance with this
section only if Canada is responsible for the delay in paying the
Contractor. Canada will not pay interest on overdue advance
payments.</li>
</ol>

<p>The amount claimed under the Contract is subject to government

behalf of Canada. Despite any transfer of ownership, the Contractor
is responsible for any loss or damage to the Work or any part of
the Work until it is delivered to Canada in accordance with the
Contract.</p>
<h2 id="government-property">2029 17 (2008-05-12) Government Property</h2>
<p>The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care of all
Government Property while it is in its possession or subject to its

part, without the prior written agreement of the Parties.</p>

<p>If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its
obligations under the Contract, or is bankrupt or insolvent or in
receivership, the Contracting Authority may, by giving written
notice to the Contractor, terminate for default the Contract or
part of the Contract. Upon the giving of such notice, the
Contractor will have no claim for further payment and remains
liable to Canada for all losses and damages suffered by Canada
because of the default, including any increase in the cost incurred
by Canada in procuring the Work from another source.</p>

<p>At any time before the completion of the Work, the Contracting
Authority may, by giving notice to the Contractor, terminate for
convenience the Contract or part of the Contract. In such case, the
Contractor will be paid for Work that has been performed, accepted
and unpaid in accordance with the Contract price. The Contractor
will be entitled to be reimbursed the actual costs reasonably and
properly incurred as a direct result of the termination, but in no
case such reimbursement must exceed the Contract price. The
Contractor will have no claim for damages, compensation, loss of
profit or otherwise, except as provided in this section.</p>
<h2 id="right-of-set-off">2029 21 (2008-05-12) Right of set-off</h2>

Contract, any amount payable to Canada by the Contractor under the
Contract or under any other current contract. Canada may, when
making a payment pursuant to the Contract, deduct from the amount
payable to the Contractor any such amount payable to Canada by the
Contractor which, by virtue of the right of set-off, may be

<h2 id="conflict-of-interest-and-values-and-ethics">2029 22 (2008-05-12) Conflict of interest and Values and Ethics
