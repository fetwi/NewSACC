<pre>1.     The Offeror agrees and accepts that its agent(s) listed on this 
       Standing Offer may represent the holder of a Standing Offer other 
       than itself.  The Offeror further agrees and accepts that its prices, 
       along with those prices offered by those other offerors, will appear 
       on the multiple call-up form, thereby making the prices specified 
       public information.

2.     The Offeror agrees to the disclosure of its prices and further 
       agrees that it shall have no right to claim against Canada, the 
       Minister, the Identified User, their employees, agents or servants, 
       or any of them, in relation to such disclosure.  The Offeror shall 
       also indemnify Canada, the Minister, the Identified User, their 
       employees, agent or servants, and any of them, against any action, 
       suit, demand, right or claim asserted by anyone as a result of such 
       disclosure.

3.     The Offeror is responsible for delivery in the event of default by 
       the agent for those products only that are normally offered by the 
       Offeror.

4.     The Identified User agrees that if the agent defaults on one or more 
       items, the call-up using PWGSC-TPSGC 944, Call-Up Against Multiple 
       Standing Offers, cannot be terminated in whole, but only for those 
       portions relating to goods or services specified in the particular 
       Standing Offer to which the default relates and only after the 
       Offeror has been provided with a reasonable opportunity to remedy 
       the default.
