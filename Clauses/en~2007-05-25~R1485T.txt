<strong>FEDERAL CONTRACTORS PROGRAM FOR EMPLOYMENT EQUITY</strong>

1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) 
       requires that some firms bidding for federal government contracts, 
       valued at $200,000 or more (including all applicable taxes), make a 
       formal commitment to implement employment equity.  This is a 
       condition precedent to contract award.  If the Propronent is subject 
       to the FCP-EE, evidence of its commitment must be provided before 
       the award of the Contract.

       Firms who have been declared ineligible contractors by Human 
       Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) are no longer 
       eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold for 
       solicitation of bids as set out in the <em>Government Contract 
       Regulations</em>.  Firms may be declared ineligible contractors either as 
       a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRSDC, or following their 
       voluntary withdrawal from the FCP-EE for a reason other than the 
       reduction of their workforce.  Any bid from ineligible contractors 
       will not be considered for award of a contract.
 
2.     If the Proponent does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 3.(
       a) or (b) below, or does not have a valid certificate number 
       confirming its adherence to the FCP-EE, the Proponent must fax a 
       copy of the signed form LAB 1168, Certificate of Commitment to 
       Implement Employment Equity, to the Labour Branch of HRSDC, at 
       819-953-8768.  The form can be found on the following Service Canada 
       Website:

                     requirements of $200,000 or more), in which case a
