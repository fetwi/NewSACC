<pre>The Offeror understands that, normally, the work shall be performed at the 
Offeror's own place of business.  However, provision will be made for the 
Offeror's personnel on a need-to-know basis and with a suitable security 
screening, to have access to sensitive (protected/classified) information 
or assets as required. 

PRIOR to the award of the Standing Offer or Call-Up, the completion of the 
Security Requirements Check List (SRCL), form TBS/SCT 350-103, will be 
required to identify the security concerns of the work and security 
screening of Offeror's personnel.  Facilities will be provided as necessary 
by the Project Authority.  Technical and clerical support, supplies and 
equipment necessary to accomplish the tasks are to be provided by the 
Offeror.
