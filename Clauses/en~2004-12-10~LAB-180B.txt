<h2>LAB-180B 01 (1991-06-01) Fair Wages and Hours Provisions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">All workmen, labourers, or other persons who perform
labour in the construction of the Work hereby contracted for, shall
be paid such wages as are generally accepted as current from time
to time during the continuance of the Contract for competent
workmen in the district in which the Work is being performed for
the character or class of work in which they are respectively
engaged, and if there be no current rate in such district, then a
fair and reasonable rate. In no event shall the wages for the
particular classification or classifications of labour concerned be
less than those established by statute or regulation of the
province in which the Work is being performed.</li>
<li value="2">The working hours shall be those fixed by the custom
of the trade as respects hours in the district where the Work is
carried on, or if there be no custom of the trade as respects hours
in the district, then fair and reasonable hours, except for the
protection of life and property, or on due cause shown to the
satisfaction of the Minister of Labour.</li>
<li value="3"><p>Where there are special circumstances which in the
judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should
do so he may decide what are the current or fair and reasonable
rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification
of any work for the purposes of wages and hours. Immediately upon
receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour
hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and
classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In
the event of a dispute arising as to what is the current or a fair
and reasonable rate of wages, or what are the current hours fixed
by the custom of the trade or fair and reasonable hours or as to
rates for overtime it shall be determined by the Minister of
Labour, whose decision shall be final; payment may also be withheld
of any moneys which would otherwise be payable to the contractor
until the Minister of Labour's decision has been complied
with.</p>
<p>By the term "current wages" and the term "hours of labour fixed
by the custom of the trade", in the foregoing, are meant
respectively the standard rates of wages and hours of labour either
recognized by signed agreements between employers and workmen in
the district from which the labour required is necessarily drawn or
actually prevailing, although not necessarily recognized by signed
agreements.</p></li>
