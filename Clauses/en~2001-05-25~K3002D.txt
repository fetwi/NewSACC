<pre>The General Conditions are amended by deleting in its entirety the section 
entitled "Copyright", which is replaced by the following:

       "Without affecting any intellectual property rights or interests 
       therein that have come into being prior to the Contract or that 
       relate to information or data supplied by Canada for purposes of the 
       Contract, all intellectual property rights in anything conceived, 
       developed, reduced to practice or produced as part of the Work under 
       the Contract shall immediately, as soon as they come into existence, 
       vest in and remain the property of the Contractor."
