<pre><strong>A.   INSTRUCTIONS</strong><strong></strong>


<strong>1.     </strong>To submit your offer, return signed original of the <strong>Request For a 
       Standing Offer</strong> <strong>(RFSO)</strong>,<strong> </strong>duly completed. Ensure that your firm's name, 
       the Department of Supply and Services (DSS) file number, 
       solicitation closing date and time are clearly visible. 
       Electronically transmitted responses (telex, facsimile and 
       commercial telegram) will also be considered (except those for the 
       Science Branch) provided they contain the DSS file number, 
       solicitation closing time and date and all requested pricing details, 
       and are subsequently confirmed as soon as possible with a duly 
       completed and signed copy of the RFSO.

<strong>2.     </strong>Offers may be accepted in whole or in part and may be accepted on 
       the lowest price per item and/or destination or group of items and/
       or destinations or on a lowest aggregate price basis.  The lowest or 
       any Standing Offer will not necessarily be authorized.  In case of 
       error in the extension of prices, the unit price will govern.  
       Offers will remain open for acceptance for a period of not less than 
       sixty (60) days from the closing date of this solicitation, unless 
       otherwise indicated herein by DSS.

<strong>3.     </strong>Municipal taxes are not applicable; for provincial taxes, see C.2 - 
       Conditions below.

       Unless otherwise specified by the Crown, all prices quoted shall be 
       net prices in Canadian funds including Canadian customs duties and 
       excise taxes, and are to be FOB, including all delivery charges to 
       destination(s) as indicated.  The amount of the goods and services 
       tax shall be shown as a separate item. 

<strong>4.     </strong>Late offers will be returned unopened.  Offers which were postmarked 
       prior to the bid closing date and are delayed in the mail will be 
       considered, provided evidence of timely mailing is supported by 
       postage cancellation.  (Note:  Postage meter imprints are not 
       acceptable as proof of timely mailing.)

<strong>5.     </strong>The Standing Offer should completely and thoroughly address each 
       element of the requirement as enumerated in the RFSO.  It is also 
       essential that the elements contained in the offer be stated in a 
       clear and concise manner.  

<strong>6.     </strong>Your Standing Offer shall be returned to the referenced address and 
       be received by the indicated closing date and time.

<strong>7.     </strong>The Standing Offer is normally processed as follows:

       a)     Offerors (suppliers) request a copy of an RFSO from DSS;

       b)     DSS sends an RFSO to Offerors soliciting offers;

       c)     Offerors then complete the request and return it to DSS as a 
              Standing Offer; 

       d)     DSS issues a <strong>Standing Offer and Call-up Authority (SOCA)</strong> to 
              successful Offerors and Identified Users (client departments 
              or agencies) authorized to make call-ups directly; and

       e)     if applicable, DSS issues a <strong>Revision to a Request For a 
              Standing Offer (RRFSO)</strong> or a <strong>Revision to a Standing Offer and 
              Call-up Authority (RSOCA)</strong> to modify or amend the original 
              RFSO or SOCA document.

<strong>8.     Method of Supply</strong><strong></strong>

       One method of supply used by DSS to satisfy the requirements of 
       Identified Users is to arrange with Offerors to submit a Standing 
       Offer to provide goods, services, or both, to the federal government 
       during a specified period.  The Identified Users to be served are 
       then delegated purchasing authority by DSS and may access the source 
       of supply directly, as and when requested, by issuing call-ups 
       detailing the exact quantities of goods or level of services they 
       wish to order from the Offeror at a particular time during the 
       effective period of the Offeror's offer and in accordance with the 
       predetermined conditions.

<strong>9.     Purpose of the Standing Offer</strong><strong></strong>

       This method of supply is particularly useful in acquiring frequently 
       ordered commercially and non-commercially available goods or 
       services when the total volume or value of goods or level of 
       services that may be required by one or more Identified Users can be 
       estimated beforehand, but it is not possible at the outset to 
       identify the exact requirements for any given user at a specific 
       time in the future.

       Inasmuch as DSS, during the period stated in the RFSO, foresees a 
       potential need for goods or services, or both, the Offeror is hereby 
       invited to provide DSS with a Standing Offer.

<strong>10.    Quantity</strong><strong></strong>

       The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated expenditure 
       specified in the RFSO are only an approximation of requirements 
       given in good faith.  The making of a Standing Offer by the Offeror 
       shall not constitute an agreement by the Crown or any Identified 
       User to order any or all of the said goods or services.  The 
       Identified Users may make one or several call-ups against a Standing 
       Offer, each such call-up constituting an acceptance of said Standing 
       Offer for the part of the said goods or services as are described in 
       the call-up.

<strong>11.    DSS Obligation</strong><strong></strong>

       A request does not commit DSS to authorize the utilization of a 
       Standing Offer or to pay any cost incurred in the submission of 
       offers, or cost incurred in making necessary studies for the 
       preparation thereof, or to procure or contract for any services or 
       supplies.  DSS reserves the right to reject or authorize for 
       utilization any offer in whole or in part, with or without further 
       discussion or negotiation.

<strong>B.   PARTICULARS OF THE STANDING OFFER</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>1.     General</strong><strong></strong>

       The Offeror acknowledges that a Standing Offer is not a contract.

<strong>       </strong>The Offeror offers to sell or provide and deliver to Her Majesty the 
       Queen in right of Canada, acting through and represented by the 
       Minister of Supply and Services, the goods or services, or both, 
       listed at the price(s) or on the pricing basis set out, as and when 
       the Identified Users may request such goods or services, in 
       accordance with the following provisions.

       It is understood and agreed that:

       a)     a call-up against a Standing Offer shall form a contract only 
              for those goods or services, or both, which have been 
              called-up, provided always that such call-up is made in 
              accordance with the provisions of the Standing Offer;

       b)     the issue and distribution  of the authorization to use this 
              Standing Offer does not oblige Her Majesty, the Minister or 
              the Identified Users, to authorize or order all or any of the 
              goods, services, or both, described in this Standing Offer;

       c)     Her Majesty's liability shall be limited to that which arises 
              from call-ups against this offer, made within the period 
              specified herein;

       d)     Her Majesty reserves the right to procure the specified goods 
              or services by means of contracts, Standing Offers, or by 
              other contracting methods.

<strong>2.     Notification of Withdrawal/Revision </strong><strong></strong>
       In the event that the offeror wishes to withdraw the Standing Offer 
       after authority to "Call-up Against a Standing Offer" has been given, 
       the Offeror shall provide no less than thirty (30) days' written 
       notice to the Minister, unless otherwise indicated herein, in order 
       that the Minister may inform all Identified Users.  Such withdrawal 
       of Standing Offer shall not be effective until receipt of such 
       notification by DSS and the expiry of such notice period.  The 
       Offeror hereby agrees to fulfil any and all call-ups which may be 
       made before the expiry of such notice period.  If the period of the 
       Standing Offer is extended or the limitation of expenditure is 
       increased, the Minister will issue a revision to the SOCA.

<strong>3.     Call-up Instrument</strong><strong></strong>

       The Identified Users shall request delivery of goods/services on 
       form DSS-MAS 942, "Call-up Against a Standing Offer", or other 
       applicable call-up document, or by other methods such as telephone, 
       FAX, telex or telegram.  All call-ups placed by telephone, telex or 
       telegraphic means must be confirmed in writing on form DSS-MAS 942 
       or other applicable call-up document.

<strong>C.   CONDITIONS</strong><strong></strong>

<strong>1.     </strong>The Conditions set out herein apply to all Standing Offers.

<strong>2.     </strong>a)     Excluding legislated exceptions (see Item d) below),

              tax levied by the province in which the taxable goods or 
              services are delivered.  This exemption has been provided to 
              Identified Users under the authority of one of the following:

              i)     Provincial Sales Tax Exemption Licence Numbers, for 
                     the provinces of:

                     Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, and the Northwest 
                     Territories, which certifies that the property and/or 
                     services ordered/purchased hereby are for the use of, 
                     and are being purchased by the federal government with 
                     Crown funds, and are therefore not subject to 
                     provincial/territorial sales and consumption taxes.

       b)     Currently, in Alberta, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, and 
              the Northwest Territories, sales taxes do not apply to goods 
              or services delivered to the federal government.

       c)     The Contractor is not exempt from paying provincial sales tax 
              under the above Exemption Licence Numbers or Exemption 
              Certification.  The Contractor is required to pay provincial 
              sales tax on taxable goods or services used or consumed in 
              the performance of the contract (as per appropriate 
              provincial legislation), including material incorporated into 
              real property.

       d)     <strong>Exceptions</strong>

              The following exceptions are provided as examples and may not 
              represent a complete list of all exceptions under the law.

              v)     insurance premiums (Quebec) 

              vi)    tires/batteries subject to environmental levies 
                     (British Columbia)

              vii)   transient living accommodation subject to hotel room 
                     taxes (Prince Edward Island and British Columbia)

<strong>3.     </strong>Invoices must be submitted in the name of the Offerors and are not 
       to be submitted prior to the shipment of supplies.  They must show 
       the name and address of the consignee, together with date, method of 
       shipment, terms of payment, the case numbers if applicable, item, 
       quantity, unit of issue, unit price, additional charges if 
       applicable, and the goods and services tax if applicable, part or 
       reference numbers, description of supplies as shown in this contract, 
       contract number, requisition number and financial code(s).  Separate 
       invoices must be submitted for each shipment and must apply to one 
       contract only.  Each invoice must indicate whether it covers partial 
       or final shipment.

<strong>4.     </strong>The goods/services are subject to inspection and acceptance by 
       consignee at destination, unless otherwise indicated herein.

<strong>5.     </strong>Material will be new production of current manufacture conforming to 
       the current issue of the specifications, standards, drawings or part 
       numbers as applicable, unless otherwise indicated herein.

<strong>6.     </strong>If transportation charges are payable by Her Majesty under the terms 
       of this contract, shipments are to be made by the most direct and 
       economical means consistent with normal shipping practice, unless 
       otherwise directed (as in the case when transportation costs are 
       part of the unit price).  They are to be shown as a separate item on 
       the invoice.

<strong>7.     </strong>Valuation:  The federal government's policy of underwriting its own 
       risks precludes payment of any excess valuation and/or 
       transportation charges beyond the specified FOB point (the point at 
       which title of goods passed to the federal government).  Goods will 
       be covered to the carrier's maximum liability and value will be 
       declared only when additional costs will not be incurred.

<strong>8.     </strong>Goods shipped into Canada from another country are to be consigned 
       to destination, IN BOND, unless otherwise directed.


<strong>9.     </strong>The transportation bill of lading must accompany the original 
   invoice, except for "collect" shipments (if and when allowed), in which 
   event it shall accompany the shipment; in addition, a packing slip must 
   accompany each shipment, showing item, quantity, part or reference 
   numbers, description of supplies and contract reference numbers.  If the 
   supplies have been inspected at the Offerors' plant, the signed 
   inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally 
   enclosed in the packing note envelope.
