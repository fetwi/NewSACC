<pre>1.     Canada's total liability to the Contractor under this Contract shall 
       not exceed $ _______, Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax 
       extra, as applicable.

2.     No increase in the total liability of Canada or in the price of the 
       Work resulting from any design changes, modifications or 
       interpretations of the specifications, will be authorized or paid to 
       the Contractor unless such design changes, modifications or 
       interpretations have been approved, in writing, by the Contracting 
       Authority prior to their incorporation into the Work.  The 
       Contractor shall not be obliged to perform any work or provide any 
       service that would cause the total liability of Canada to be 
       exceeded without the prior written approval of the Contracting 
       Authority.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Authority in 
       writing as to the adequacy of this sum when: 

       (a)    it is 75 percent committed, or 

       (b)    four (4) months prior to the Contract expiry date, or 

       (c)    if the Contractor considers that the funds provided are 
              inadequate for the completion of the Work,

              whichever comes first.

3.     In the event that the notification refers to inadequate funds, the 
       Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Authority, in writing, 
       an estimate for the additional funds required.  Provision of such 
       notification and estimate for the additional funds does not increase 
       Canada's liability.
