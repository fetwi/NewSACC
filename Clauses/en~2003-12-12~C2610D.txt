<pre>1.     As the goods to be supplied under the Contract are defence supplies, 
       customs duties on importation to Canada may be remitted under the 
       Tariff Item Number 9982.00.00 of the Schedule to the Customs Tariff.

2.     Remission of customs duty payable may be granted under the Tariff 
       Item Number 9982.00.00 when the total contract value of the defence 
       supplies is C$250,000 or more.  This reflects the import value of 
       the goods plus the duty that would be applicable in the absence of 
       the Customs Tariff.

3.     The Department of National Defence will be responsible for 
       prearranging remission on importation or for paying customs duties 
       on importation and applying to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency for 
       a refund.  The importer is responsible for applying to Public Works 
       and Government Services Canada in good time for the certification 
       required by the Customs Tariff.
