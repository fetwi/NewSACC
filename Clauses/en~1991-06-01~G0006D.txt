<pre>No insurance is necessary as the Crown assumes its own risks and 
   liabilities.  However, where the Lessor holds a policy of insurance in 
   respect of a vehicle supplied against the lease, a copy or evidence of 
   such insurance is to be provided to the Lessee, and applies in those 
   provinces where provincial law makes it mandatory for the Lessor to 
   insure and license leased vehicles.
