<pre>1.     The Supplier Registration Information (SRI) service has created a 
       data base of registered suppliers interested in doing business with 
       the federal government. SRI offers suppliers a central registration 
       point and allows government buyers to search for sources of supply 
       for low-dollar value opportunities not included in MERXTM. You should 
       register in SRI and obtain a Procurement Business Number (PBN) which 
       will identify you in the system. Processing the SRI registration may 
       take up to two working days, therefore if you do not have a PBN you 
       should obtain one through SRI to avoid possible future delays. You 
       may register in SRI directly through the Internet: <strong>http://
       contractscanada.gc.ca</strong>.

2.     For non-Internet registration, please contact one of the Contracts 
       Canada Supplier Registration Agents.

3.     SRI can be accessed by all departments and agencies giving you 
       greater potential for opportunities. The PBN will eventually become 
       the common identifier for all government purchasing and payment 
       systems as government implements electronic commerce processes. You 
       are strongly encouraged to obtain your PBN through the SRI service 
       as soon as possible.
