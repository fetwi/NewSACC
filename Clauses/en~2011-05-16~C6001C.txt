<li value="2">No increase in the total liability of Canada or in
the price of the Work resulting from any design changes,
modifications or interpretations of the Work, will be authorized or
paid to the Contractor unless these design changes, modifications
or interpretations have been approved, in writing, by the
Contracting Authority before their incorporation into the Work. The
Contractor must not perform any work or provide any service that
would result in Canada's total liability being exceeded before
obtaining the written approval of the Contracting Authority. The
Contractor must notify the Contracting Authority in writing as to
the adequacy of this sum:

<li value="3">If the notification is for inadequate contract funds,
the Contractor must provide to the Contracting Authority a written
estimate for the additional funds required. Provision of such
information by the Contractor does not increase Canada's
liability.</li>
