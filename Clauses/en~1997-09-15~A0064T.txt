<pre>1.     If a Contract is issued as a result of this Request for Proposal, it 
       will be issued to the Bidder whose proposal has the LOWEST TOTAL 
       COST over the potential Contract period of ____ months (proposed 
       Contract period is ____ months plus ____ option periods of ____ 
       months).

2.     The TOTAL COST will include the following:

       (a)    the monthly rates quoted to provide on-site preventive and 
              remedial maintenance services for the equipment listed in 
              Appendices "____" to "____" during the Principal Period of 
              Maintenance (PPM); AND

       (b)    the hourly rates quoted to provide on-site preventive and 
              remedial maintenance services outside the PPM, as detailed in 
              Appendix " ____."

       The aggregate of the above will be used to calculate the total cost 
       of the total requirement (the Contract period plus any applicable 
       option periods). This total will then be used for evaluation 
       purposes.

       The evaluation of bids will not include the estimated amount of 
       Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax as applicable.
