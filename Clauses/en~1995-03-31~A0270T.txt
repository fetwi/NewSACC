<pre>1.     To be considered responsive, a bid/offer must:

       (a)    meet all the mandatory requirements of this solicitation; and

       (b)    obtain the required minimum points for the criteria which are 
              subject to point rating specified in this solicitation.

2.     Bids/offers not meeting (a) or (b) above will be given no further 
   consideration. Neither the responsive bid/offer that scores the highest 
   number of rated points nor the one that contains the lowest price will 
   necessarily be accepted. The responsive bid/offer with the lowest price 
   per rated point will be recommended for award of a Contract or issuance 
   of a standing offer, as the case may be.
