non-exclusive. 



<strong>9676   03     (04/01/94)    Status of the Contractor</strong>

The <em>Contractor</em> is engaged as an independent <em>Contractor</em> for the sole purpose 
of performing the <em>Work</em>.  Neither the <em>Contractor</em> nor any of its personnel is 
engaged as an employee, servant or agent of <em>Canada</em>.  The <em>Contractor</em> is

Plans, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, or income tax.


<strong>9676   04     (04/01/94)    Amendments and Waivers</strong>

1.     No design change, modification to the <em>Work</em>, or amendment to the <em>
       Contract</em> shall be binding unless it is incorporated into the <em>
       Contract</em> by written amendment or design change memorandum executed 
       by the authorized representatives of the <em>Minister</em> and of the <em>
       Contractor</em>.

2.     While the <em>Contractor</em> may discuss any proposed changes or 
       modifications to the scope of the <em>Work</em> with the <em>Technical Authority</em>, <em>
       Canada</em> shall not be liable for the cost of any such change or 
       modification until it has been incorporated into the <em>Contract</em> in 
       accordance with subsection 1.

3.     No waiver shall be valid, binding or affect the rights of the <em>
       Parties</em> unless it is made in writing by, in the case of a waiver by <em>
       Canada</em>, the <em>Contracting Authority</em> and, in the case of a waiver by 
       the <em>Contractor</em>, the authorized representative of the <em>Contractor</em>.

4.     The waiver by a <em>Party</em> of a breach of any term or condition of the <em>
       Contract</em> shall not prevent the enforcement of that term or condition 
       by that <em>Party</em> in the case of a subsequent breach, and shall not be 
       deemed or construed a waiver of any subsequent breach. 


<strong>9676   05     (01/12/00)    Conduct of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Contractor</em> represents and warrants that:

       (a)    it is competent to perform the <em>Work</em>; and

       (b)    it has the necessary qualifications, including knowledge, 
              skill and experience to perform the <em>Work</em>, together with the 
              ability to use those qualifications effectively for that 
              purpose.

2.     Except for <em>Government Property</em> specifically provided for in the <em>
       Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall supply everything necessary for the 
       performance of the <em>Work</em>, including all the resources, facilities, 
       labour and supervision, management, services, equipment, materials, 
       drawings, technical data, technical assistance, engineering services, 
       inspection and quality assurance procedures, and planning necessary 
       to perform the <em>Work</em>.

3.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall ensure the safety of workers and carry out the 
       Work in a diligent and efficient manner in accordance with 
       established industry practice and laws for the health and safety of 
       workers related to the performance of the Work.

 
4.     The <em>Work</em> shall not be performed by any person who, in the opinion of 
       the <em>Minister</em> or the <em>Technical Authority</em>, is incompetent or has been 
       conducting himself/herself improperly.

5.     The <em>Contractor</em> warrants that all services performed under this <em>
       Contract</em> will, at the time of acceptance, be free from defects in 
       workmanship and conform to the requirements of this <em>Contract</em>.  If 
       the <em>Contractor</em> is required to correct or replace the <em>Work</em> or any 
       portion thereof, it shall be at no cost to <em>Canada</em>, and any work 
       corrected or replaced by the <em>Contractor</em> pursuant to this subsection 
       shall be subject to all provisions of this <em>Contract</em> to the same 
       extent as <em>Work</em> initially performed.

6.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall adhere to the <em>Technical Authority</em>'s reasonable 
       interpretation of the requirements of the <em>Contract</em> insofar as such 
       an interpretation is not inconsistent with any other part of the <em>
       Contract</em>.

7.     Unless the <em>Minister</em> orders the <em>Work</em> or part thereof to be suspended 
       pursuant to section 22 (Suspension of the Work), the <em>Contractor</em> 
       shall not stop or suspend any part of the <em>Work</em> pending the 
       settlement or resolution of any difference between the <em>Parties</em> 
       arising out of the <em>Contract</em>.

8.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall provide such reports on the performance of the <em>
       Work</em> as are required by the <em>Contract</em> and such other reports as may 
       reasonably be required by the <em>Minister</em> or the <em>Technical Authority</em>.

9.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall be fully responsible for performing the <em>Work</em> 
       and <em>Canada</em> shall not be liable for any negative consequences or 
       extra costs arising out of the <em>Contractor</em>'s following any advice 
       given by <em>Canada</em>, whether given without or upon invitation by the <em>
       Contractor</em>, unless the advice was provided to the <em>Contractor</em> in 
       writing by the <em>Contracting Authority</em> and was accompanied by a 
       statement specifically relieving the <em>Contractor</em> of any 
       responsibility for negative consequences or extra costs that might 
       arise from following the advice.


<strong>9676   06     (04/01/94)    Compliance with Applicable Laws</strong>

The <em>Contractor</em> shall comply with all laws applicable to the performance of 
the <em>Work</em> or any part thereof including, without limitation, all laws 
concerning health and labour conditions and the protection of the 
environment, and shall require compliance therewith by all of its 
subcontractors.  Evidence of compliance with such laws shall be furnished 
by the <em>Contractor</em> to the <em>Contracting Authority</em> at such times as the <em>
Contracting Authority</em> may reasonably request. 


<strong>9676   07     (04/01/94)    Subcontracting</strong>

1.     Unless otherwise provided in the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall 
       obtain the consent of the <em>Minister</em> in writing prior to sub<em>Contract</em>
       ing or permitting the subcontracting of any portion of the <em>Work</em> at 
       any tier.

2.     Notwithstanding subsection 1, the <em>Contractor</em> may, without prior 
       consent of the <em>Minister</em>, subcontract such portions of the <em>Work</em> as is 
       customary in the carrying out of similar contracts.

3.     In any <em>Subcontract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall, unless the <em>Minister</em> 
       otherwise consents in writing, ensure that the Subcontractor is 
       bound by terms and conditions compatible with and, in the opinion of 
       the <em>Minister</em>, not less favourable to <em>Canada</em> than the terms and 
       conditions of the <em>Contract</em>.  Deviations in any <em>Subcontract</em> from the 
       terms of the <em>Contract</em>, including any right of termination of the <em>
       Contract</em>, shall be entirely at the risk of the <em>Contractor</em>.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> is not obliged to seek consent to subcontracts 
       specifically authorized in the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     Any consent to a <em>Subcontract</em> shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from 
       its obligations under the <em>Contract</em> or be construed as authorizing 
       any liability on the part of <em>Canada</em> or the <em>Minister</em> to a 
       Subcontractor. 


<strong>9676   08     (04/01/94)    Replacement of Personnel</strong>

1.     When specific persons have been named in the <em>Contract</em> as the persons 
       who must perform the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall provide the services 
       of the persons so named unless the <em>Contractor</em> is unable to do so for 
       reasons beyond its control.

2.     If, at any time, the <em>Contractor</em> is unable to provide the services of 
       any specific person named in the <em>Contract</em>, it shall provide a 
       replacement person who is of similar ability and attainment.

3.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall, before replacing any specific person named in 
       the <em>Contract</em>, provide notice in writing to the <em>Minister</em> containing:

       (a)    the reason for the removal of the named person from the <em>Work</em>;

       (b)    the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed 
              replacement person; and

       (c)    proof that the person has the required security clearance 
              granted by <em>Canada</em>, if applicable.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall not, in any event, allow performance of the <em>
       Work</em> by unauthorized replacement persons and acceptance of a 
       replacement person by the <em>Technical Authority</em> and the <em>Contracting 
       Authority</em> shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from responsibility to 
       meet the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     The <em>Minister</em> may order the removal from the <em>Work</em> of any such 
       replacement person and the <em>Contractor</em> shall immediately remove the 
       person from the <em>Work</em> and shall, in accordance with subsection 2 and 
       paragraphs 3(b) and (c), secure a further replacement.

6.     The fact that the <em>Minister</em> does not order the removal of a 
       replacement person from the <em>Work</em> shall not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> 
       from its responsibility to meet the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>9676   09     (04/01/94)    Assignment</strong>

1.     The <em>Contract</em> shall not be assigned, in whole or in part, by the <em>
       Contractor</em> without the prior consent in writing of the <em>Minister</em> and 
       any purported assignment made without that consent is void and of no 
       effect.

2.     No assignment of the <em>Contract</em> shall relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from any 
       obligation under the <em>Contract</em> or impose any liability upon <em>Canada</em> or 
       the <em>Minister</em>, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the <em>Minister</em>. 


<strong>9676   10     (04/01/94)    Time of the Essence</strong>

Time is of the essence of the <em>Contract</em>. 


<strong>9676   11     (04/01/94)    Excusable Delay</strong>

1.     A delay in the performance by the <em>Contractor</em> of any obligation under 
       the <em>Contract</em> which is caused solely by an event that

       (a)    was beyond the reasonable control of the <em>Contractor</em>,

       (b)    could not reasonably have been foreseen,

       (c)    could not reasonably have been prevented by means reasonably 
              available to the <em>Contractor</em>, and

       (d)    occurred without the fault or neglect of the <em>Contractor</em>

       shall, subject to subsections 2, 3 and 4, constitute an "Excusable 
       Delay" provided that the <em>Contractor</em> invokes this section by notice 
       under subsection 4.

2.     If any delay in the <em>Contractor</em>'s performance of any obligation under 
       the <em>Contract</em> is caused by a delay of a Subcontractor, such a delay 
       may constitute an Excusable Delay for the <em>Contractor</em>, but only if 
       the delay of the Subcontractor meets the criteria set out in this 
       section for an Excusable Delay by the <em>Contractor</em> and only to the 
       extent that the delay has not been contributed to by the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     Notwithstanding subsection 1, any delay caused by lack of financial 
       resources of the <em>Contractor</em> or an event that is a ground for 
       termination provided for in subsection 23(2) (Default by the 
       Contractor), or any delay in the <em>Contractor</em> fulfilling an obligation 
       to deliver a bond, guarantee, letter of credit or other security 
       relating to performance or the payment of money, shall not qualify 
       as an Excusable Delay.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall not benefit from an Excusable Delay unless the <em>
       Contractor</em> has:

       (a)    used its best efforts to minimize the delay and recover lost 
              time;

       (b)    advised the <em>Minister</em> of the occurrence of the delay or of the 
              likelihood of a delay occurring as soon as the <em>Contractor</em> has 
              become aware of it;

       (c)    within 15 working days of the beginning of a delay or of the 
              likelihood of a delay coming to the attention of the <em>
              Contractor</em>, advised the <em>Minister</em> of the full facts or matters 
              giving rise to the delay, and provided to the <em>Minister</em> for 
              approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) 
              a clear "work-around" plan indicating in detail the steps 
              that the <em>Contractor</em> proposes to take in order to minimize the 
              impact of the event causing the delay; this plan shall 
              include alternative sources of materials and labour, if the 
              event causing the delay involves the supply of them; and

       (d)    carried out the work-around plan approved by the <em>Minister</em>.

5.     In the event of an Excusable Delay, any delivery date or other date 
       that is directly affected shall be postponed for a reasonable time 
       not to exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.  The Parties 
       shall amend the <em>Contract</em>, as appropriate, to reflect any such change 
       in dates.

6.     Notwithstanding subsection 5, the <em>Minister</em> may, after an Excusable 
       Delay has continued for 30 days or more, in the <em>Minister</em>'s absolute 
       discretion terminate the <em>Contract</em>.  In such a case, the Parties 
       agree that neither will make any claim against the other for damages, 
       costs, expected profits or any other loss arising out of the 
       termination or the event that gave rise to the Excusable Delay.  The <em>
       Contractor</em> agrees to repay immediately to <em>Canada</em> the portion of any 
       advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.  
       Subsections 23(4), (5) and (6) (Default by the Contractor) apply in 
       the event of a termination under this subsection.

7      Except to the extent that <em>Canada</em> is responsible for the delay for 
       reasons of failure to meet an obligation under the <em>Contract</em>, <em>Canada</em> 
       shall not be liable for any costs or charges of any nature incurred 
       by the <em>Contractor</em> or any of its subcontractors or agents as a result 
       of an Excusable Delay.


<strong>9676   12     (16/02/98)    Security and Protection of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall keep confidential all information provided to 
       the <em>Contractor</em> by or on behalf of <em>Canada</em> in connection with the <em>Work</em> 
       and all information developed by the <em>Contractor</em> as part of the <em>Work</em>, 
       title to which vests in <em>Canada</em> under the <em>Contract</em>, and shall not 
       disclose any such information to any person without the written 
       permission of the <em>Minister</em>, except that the <em>Contractor</em> may disclose 
       to a Subcontractor authorized in accordance with section 07 
       (Subcontracting) information necessary to the performance of the <em>
       Subcontract</em>.  This subsection does not apply to any information 
       where the same information:

       (a)    is publicly available from a source other than the <em>Contractor</em>; 
              or

       (b)    is or becomes known to the <em>Contractor</em> from a source other 
              than <em>Canada</em>, except any source that is known to the <em>
              Contractor</em> to be under an obligation to <em>Canada</em> not to 
              disclose the information.

2.     When the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Work</em>, or any information referred to in 
       subsection 1 is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, or 
       PROTECTED by <em>Canada</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall at all times take all 
       measures reasonably necessary for the safeguarding of the material 
       so identified, including those set out in the Department of Public 
       Works and Government Services <em>Industrial Security Manual</em> and its 
       supplements and any other instructions issued by the <em>Minister</em>. 
3,     Without limiting the generality of subsections 1 and 2, when the <em>
       Contract</em>, the <em>Work</em>, or any information referred to in subsection 1 
       is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, or PROTECTED by <em>
       Canada</em>, the <em>Minister</em> shall be entitled to inspect the <em>Contractor</em>'s 
       premises and the premises of a Subcontractor at any tier for 
       security purposes at any time during the term of the <em>Contract</em>, and 
       the <em>Contractor</em> shall comply with, and ensure that any such 
       Subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by the <em>
       Minister</em> dealing with the material so identified, including any 
       requirement that employees of the <em>Contractor</em> or of any such 
       Subcontractor execute and deliver declarations relating to 
       reliability screenings, security clearances and other procedures.

4.     Any proposed change in the security requirements after the effective 
       date of the <em>Contract</em> that would involve a significant increase in 
       cost to the <em>Contractor</em> shall require an amendment to the <em>Contract</em> 
       under the provisions of section 04 (Amendments and Waivers).


<strong>9676   13     (04/01/94)    Payment</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, no payment 
       shall be made to the <em>Contractor</em> unless and until:

       (a)    an invoice, inspection notes, certificates and any other 
              documents required by the <em>Contract</em> have been submitted in 
              accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em> and the 
              instructions of the <em>Minister</em>;

       effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during the 
       calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in 
       which payment is made, where the "<em>Bank Rate</em>" means the rate of 
       interest established from time to time by the Bank of Canada as the

       by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an 
       amount <em>due and payable</em>;

       an amount is "<em>due and payable</em>" when it is due and payable by <em>Canada</em> 
       to the <em>Contractor</em> in accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em>; and

       an amount becomes "<em>overdue</em>" when it is unpaid on the first day 
       following the day upon which it is <em>due and payable</em>. 
2.     Subject to the <em>Contract</em>, <em>Canada</em> shall be liable to pay to the <em>
       Contractor</em> simple interest at the <em>Average Rate</em> plus 3 percent per 
       annum on any amount that is <em>overdue</em>, from the date such amount 
       becomes <em>overdue</em> until the day prior to the <em>date of payment</em>, 
       inclusive. Interest shall be paid without notice from the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     <em>Canada</em> shall not be liable to pay interest in accordance with this 
       section if <em>Canada</em> is not responsible for the delay in paying the <em>
       Contractor</em>.

4.     <em>Canada</em> shall not be liable to pay interest on <em>overdue</em> advance 
       payments.

       submitted by the <em>Contractor</em> in response to an invitation from the <em>
       Minister</em>.

       imposition or repeal), on or after the date of submission of the bid, 
       of any tax, customs or other duty, charge, or any similar imposition 
       that is imposed under sales or excise tax legislation of the 
       Government of Canada and which affects the <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em> of 
       the <em>Work</em>, the <em>Contract</em> Price shall be adjusted to reflect the 
       increase or decrease in the <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em>.

3.     There shall be no adjustment under subsection 2 in respect of any 
       change that would increase the <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em> of the <em>Work</em> if 
       public notice of the change was given before the bid submission date 
       in sufficient detail to permit the <em>Contractor</em> to have calculated the 
       effect on its <em>Cost</em> before that date.

4.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall forward to the <em>Minister</em> a certified statement 
       showing the increase or decrease in<em> Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em> that is 
       directly attributable to the change in the imposition.  The <em>Minister</em> 
       may verify the increase or decrease in <em>Cost</em> by audit before or after 
       the <em>Contract Price</em> is adjusted.

5.     Notwithstanding subsections 2 to 4, no adjustment to the <em>Contract 
       Price</em> in respect of the <em>Work</em> or a part thereof shall be made for a 
       change in any imposition referred to in this section that occurs 
       after the date required by the <em>Contract</em> for delivery of the <em>Work</em> or 
       that part of the <em>Work</em>.

correction or replacement at the <em>Contractor</em>'s expense.  The <em>Technical</em> or <em>
Inspection Authority</em> shall inform the <em>Contractor</em> of the reasons for any

not relieve the <em>Contractor</em> from responsibility to meet the requirements of

       Contract</em>. 
4.     Any vesting of title referred to in subsection 2 shall not 
       constitute acceptance by <em>Canada</em> of the <em>Work</em> and shall not relieve

       with the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     If the <em>Contract</em> is a defence <em>Contract</em> within the meaning of the <em>

<strong>9676   22     (04/01/94)    Suspension of the Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Minister</em> may at any time, by written notice, order the <em>
       Contractor</em> to suspend or stop all or part of the <em>Work</em> under the <em>
       Contract</em> for a period of up to 180 days.  The <em>Contractor</em> shall 
       immediately comply with any such order in the manner that minimizes 
       the cost of so doing.  While such an order is in effect, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall not remove any part of the <em>Work</em> from any premises 
       without the prior written consent of the <em>Contracting Authority</em>.  At 
       any time prior to the expiration of the 180 days, the <em>Minister</em> shall 
       either rescind the order or terminate the <em>Contract</em>, in whole or in 
       part, under section 23 (Default by the Contractor) or section 24 
       (Termination for Convenience).

2.     When an order is made under subsection 1, unless the <em>Minister</em>

       the <em>Contractor</em> abandons the <em>Contract</em>, the <em>Contractor</em> shall be 
       entitled to be paid its additional <em>Costs</em> incurred as a result of the 
       suspension plus a fair and reasonable profit thereon.

              accordance with the <em>Contract</em>;

       (b)    if the suspension has affected the <em>Contractor</em>'s ability to 
              meet any delivery date under the <em>Contract</em>, the date for the 
              performance of that part of the <em>Work</em> affected by the 
              suspension shall be extended for a period equal to the period 
              of suspension plus a period, if any, which in the opinion of 
              the <em>Minister</em> following consultation with the <em>Contractor</em> is 
              reasonably necessary for the <em>Contractor</em> to resume the <em>Work</em>; 
              and

       (c)    subject to section 04 (Amendments and Waivers), an equitable 
              adjustment shall be made as necessary to affected terms and 
              conditions of the <em>Contract</em>.


<strong>9676   23     (04/01/94)    Default by the Contractor</strong>

       written notice to the <em>Contractor</em>, terminate for default the whole or 
       any part of the <em>Contract</em>, either immediately, or at the expiration 
       of a cure period specified in the notice if the <em>Contractor</em> has not 
       cured the default to the satisfaction of the <em>Minister</em> within that 
       cure period.

2.     Where the <em>Contractor</em> becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an 
       assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit of any 
       statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or where a 
       receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a receiving order 
       is made against the <em>Contractor</em>, or an order is made or a resolution 
       passed for the winding up of the <em>Contractor</em>, the <em>Minister</em> may, to 
       the extent permitted by the laws of <em>Canada</em>, upon giving notice to 
       the <em>Contractor</em>, immediately terminate for default the whole or any 
       part of the <em>Contract</em>.

3.     Upon the giving of a notice provided for in subsection 1 or 2, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall have no claim for further payment other than as 
       provided in this section, but shall be liable to <em>Canada</em> for any 
       amounts, including milestone payments, paid by <em>Canada</em> and for all 
       losses and damages which may be suffered by <em>Canada</em> by reason of the 
       default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including any 
       increase in the cost incurred by <em>Canada</em> in procuring the <em>Work</em> from 
       another source.  The <em>Contractor</em> agrees to repay immediately to <em>
       Canada</em> the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at 
       the date of the termination.  Nothing in this section affects any 
       obligation of <em>Canada</em> under the law to mitigate damages.

4.     Upon termination of the <em>Contract</em> under this section, the <em>Minister</em> 
       may require the <em>Contractor</em> to deliver to <em>Canada</em>, in the manner and 
       to the extent directed by the <em>Minister</em>, any completed parts of the <em>
       Work</em> which have not been delivered and accepted prior to the 
       termination and any material, equipment or work-in-process which the <em>
       Contractor</em> has acquired or produced specifically in the fulfilment 
       of the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     Subject to the deduction of any claim that <em>Canada</em> may have against 
       the <em>Contractor</em> arising under the <em>Contract</em> or out of the termination, <em>
       Canada</em> shall pay or credit to the <em>Contractor</em> the value, determined 
       on the basis of the<em> Contract Price</em> including the proportionate part 
       of the <em>Contractor</em>'s profit or fee included in the <em>Contract Price</em>, of 
       all completed parts of the <em>Work</em> delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to a 
       direction under subsection 4 and accepted by <em>Canada</em>, and shall pay 
       or credit to the <em>Contractor</em> the Cost to the <em>Contractor</em> that the <em>
       Minister</em> considers reasonable in respect of all material, equipment 
       or work-in-process delivered to <em>Canada</em> pursuant to a direction under 
       subsection 4 and accepted by <em>Canada</em>, but in no event shall the 
       aggregate of the amounts paid by <em>Canada</em> under the <em>Contract</em> to the 
       date of termination and any amounts payable pursuant to this 
       subsection exceed the <em>Contract Price</em>.

6.     Title to all material, equipment, work-in-process and finished work 
       in respect of which payment is made to the <em>Contractor</em> shall, upon 
       such payment being made, pass to and vest in <em>Canada</em> unless already 
       so vested under any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, and such 
       material, equipment, work-in-process and finished work shall be 
       delivered according to the order of the <em>Minister</em>, but <em>Canada</em> will 
       not accept and will not pay for material, equipment or 
       work-in-process that would not have been required to perform the <em>
       Work</em> or that exceed what would have been required to perform the <em>
       Work</em>.

7.     Where, subsequent to issuance of a notice pursuant to subsection 1, 
       the <em>Minister</em> is satisfied that grounds did not exist for a 
       termination under this section, the notice shall be deemed a notice 
       of termination for convenience issued under subsection 24(1) 
       (Termination for Convenience).


<strong>9676   24     (04/01/94)    Termination for Convenience</strong>

       termination notice"), terminate the <em>Contract</em> as regards all or any 
       part of the <em>Work</em> not completed.  Upon a termination notice being 
       given, the <em>Contractor</em> shall cease work in accordance with and to the 
       extent specified in the notice, but shall proceed to complete such 
       part or parts of the <em>Work</em> as are not affected by the termination 
       notice.  The <em>Minister</em> may, at any time or from time to time, give 
       one or more additional termination notices with respect to any or 
       all parts of the <em>Work</em> not terminated by any previous termination 
       notice.

2.     In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to 
       subsection 1, the <em>Contractor</em> shall be entitled to be paid, to the 
       extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for 
       purposes of performing the <em>Contract</em> and to the extent that the <em>
       Contractor</em> has not already been so paid or reimbursed by <em>Canada</em> 
       including the unliquidated portion of any advance payment:

       (a)    on the basis of the <em>Contract</em> Price, for all completed work 
              that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the <em>
              Contract</em>, whether completed before, or after and in 
              compliance with the instructions contained in, the 
              termination notice; 

       (b)    the cost to the <em>Contractor</em> plus a fair and reasonable profit 
              thereon, for all work terminated by the termination notice 
              before completion, the <em>Cost</em> to the <em>Contractor</em> being 
              determined in accordance with the terms of the <em>Contract</em> and 
              with <em>Contract</em> Cost Principles DSS-MAS 1031-2;

       (c)    the amount of any capital expenditures actually incurred only 
              if they were specifically authorized under the <em>Contract</em> or 
              approved in writing by the <em>Minister</em> for the purpose of the <em>
              Contract</em>, less any depreciation in respect thereof already 
              taken into account in determining <em>Cost</em>, to the extent that 
              the capital expenditures are properly apportionable to the 
              performance of the <em>Contract</em>;

       (d)    all <em>Costs</em> of and incidental to the termination of the <em>Work</em> or 
              part thereof, including the <em>Cost</em> of cancellation of 
              obligations incurred by the <em>Contractor</em> with respect to the 
              terminated work or part thereof, the <em>Cost</em> of and incidental 
              to the taking of an inventory of materials, components, 
              work-in-process and finished work on hand related to the <em>
              Contract</em> at the date of the termination, and the cost of 
              preparation of necessary accounts and statements with respect 
              to <em>Work</em> performed to the effective date of the termination 
              and commitments made by the <em>Contractor</em> with respect to the 
              terminated portions of the <em>Work</em>; but not including the cost 
              of severance payments or damages to employees whose services 
              are no longer required by reason of the termination except 
              wages that the <em>Contractor</em> is obligated by statute to pay them 
              and except for reasonable severance payments or damages paid 
              to employees hired to perform the <em>Contract</em> whose hiring was 
              expressly required by the <em>Contract</em> or approved in writing by 
              the <em>Minister</em> for the purpose of the <em>Contract</em>. 
3.     In paragraph 2(c), "capital expenditures" includes the entry into 
       leases of real property and equipment.

4.     The <em>Minister</em> may reduce the payment in respect of any of the Work to 
       the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in meeting the 
       requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.

5.     Notwithstanding anything in subsection 2, the total of the amounts 
       to which the <em>Contractor</em> is entitled under paragraphs 2(a) to (c) 
       inclusive, together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to 
       the <em>Contractor</em> under other provisions of the <em>Contract</em>, shall not 
       exceed the <em>Contract Price</em> or the portion thereof that is applicable 
       to the part of the <em>Work</em> that is terminated, and shall not exceed the 
       proportion of the price quoted by the <em>Contractor</em> for all of the <em>Work</em> 
       that is reasonably attributable to the proportion of the <em>Work</em> 
       performed to the effective date of the termination.

6.     In the procuring of materials and parts required for the performance 
       of the <em>Contract</em> and in the subcontracting of any of the <em>Work</em>, the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall, unless otherwise authorized by the <em>Minister</em>, place 
       purchase orders and subcontracts on terms that will enable the <em>
       Contractor</em> to terminate the same upon terms and conditions similar 
       in effect to those provided in this section, and generally the <em>
       Contractor</em> shall co-operate with the <em>Minister</em> and do everything 
       reasonably within its power at all times to minimize the amount of <em>
       Canada</em>'s obligations in the event of a termination under this 
       section.

7.     Title to all material, equipment, work-in-process and finished work 
       in respect of which payment is made to the <em>Contractor</em> shall, upon 
       such payment being made, pass to and vest in <em>Canada</em> unless already 
       so vested under any other provision of the <em>Contract</em>, and such 
       material, equipment, work-in-process and finished work shall be 
       delivered according to the order of the <em>Minister</em>, but <em>Canada</em> will 
       not accept and will not pay for material, equipment or 
       work-in-process that would not have been required to perform the <em>
       Work</em> or that exceed what would have been required to perform the <em>
       Work</em>.

8.     The <em>Contractor</em> shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of, or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of, any action taken or termination notice 
       given by the <em>Minister</em> under this section, except to the extent that 
       this section expressly provides.

       invoices, receipts and vouchers relating thereto. The <em>Contractor</em>
