<pre>1.     In order to avoid any real or apparent conflicts of interest, the 
       Contractor hereby agrees that it will not, during the term of the 
       contract, undertake or perform services on behalf of, or contract 
       with (<strong><em class="wsStyleUnderline">Insert the name of the Contractor(s)</em></strong><em class="wsStyleUnderline"> )</em>.

2.     The Contractor further agrees that it will ensure that personnel 
       provided, pursuant to  the Contract, shall devote their full time 
       and attention to the performance of the services to be provided 
       hereunder and will not, therefore, be in a position of any possible 
       conflict of interest during the term hereof. 

3.     It shall be a term of the Contract: 

       (a)    that no former public office holder who is not in compliance 
              with the post-employment provisions of the Conflict of 
              Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders 
              shall derive a direct benefit from the Contract; and 

       (b)    that during the term of the Contract any persons engaged in 
              the course of carrying out this Contract shall conduct 
              themselves in compliance with the principles of the Conflict 
              of Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office 
              Holders. Should an interest be acquired during the life of 
              the Contract that would cause a conflict of interest or seem 
              to cause a departure from the principles, the Contractor 
              shall declare it immediately to the departmental 
              representative.
