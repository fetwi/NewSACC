<pre><strong>SI1    (2003-05-30)  Introduction</strong>

1.     Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) intends to 
       retain an individual consulting firm or joint venture to provide the 
       professional services for the project as set out in this Request for 
       Proposal (RFP).

2.     This is a single phase selection process.  The nature of the 
       requirement and the anticipated limited number of response by the 
       industry leads PWGSC to believe that this approach will not unduly 
       force a large number of firms to expend an overall unreasonable 
       amount of effort in response to PWGSC.

3.     Proponents responding to this RFP are requested to submit a full and 
       complete proposal.  The proposal will cover not only the 
       qualifications, experience and organization of the proposed 
       Consultant Team, but also the detailed approach to the work, and the 
       pricing and terms offered.  A combination of the technical and price 
       of services submissions will constitute the proposal.
