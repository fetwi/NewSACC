<pre>No increase in the total liability of Canada or in the price of Work 
resulting from any design changes, modifications or interpretations of 
specifications, made by the Contractor, will be authorized or paid to the 
Contractor unless such changes, modifications or interpretations, have been 
approved, in writing, by the Contracting Authority, prior to their 
incorporation into the Work. The Contractor shall not be obliged to perform 
any work or provide any service that would cause the total liability of 
Canada to be exceeded, unless an increase is authorized by the Contracting 
Authority.
