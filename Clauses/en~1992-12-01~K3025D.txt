<pre>The Contractor hereby grants to Canada a licence to use such of its 
Background Intellectual Property that is incorporated into or necessary to 
perform the Work under this Contract as Canada may require for the 
alteration or further development of the Work or the Foreground 
Intellectual Property, including the right to sublicense its use by 
contractors engaged by Canada for such a purpose.  Any such sublicence 
shall restrict the Other Contractor from any use of the Background 
Intellectual Property other than in the performance of a contract with 
Canada and shall require the Other Contractor to maintain the 
confidentiality of the intellectual property.  For any such Background 
Intellectual Property that is not already a deliverable under the Contract 
or to which Canada does not already have equivalent rights under a previous 
contract or otherwise, Canada shall pay to the Contractor reasonable 
compensation for the use.  Subsection (9) of the Intellectual Property 
Rights clause referenced in this document shall apply in respect of such 
Background Intellectual Property.  Subject to the Access to Information Act, 
R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1, Canada will not release or disclose outside the 
Government of Canada any such Background Intellectual Property, other than 
under a sublicence referred to in this clause, unless the same information:

(a)    is publicly available from a source other than the Contractor;

(b)    is or becomes known to Canada from a source other than the 
       Contractor, except from any source that is known to Canada to be 
       under an obligation to the Contractor not to disclose the 
       information; or

(c)    is independently developed by or for Canada.
