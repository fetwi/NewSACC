<pre>1.     As this Contract requires production of or access to controlled 
       goods that are subject to the<em> Defence Production Act</em>, the Contractor 
       and any subcontractor are hereby advised that, within Canada, only 
       persons who are registered, exempt or excluded under the Controlled 
       Goods Program (CGP) are lawfully entitled to examine, possess or 
       transfer controlled goods.  Details on how to register under the CGP 
       are available at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline"><a href="http://www.cgp.gc.ca" rel="external">http://www.cgp.gc.ca</a></strong>.

2.     When the Contractor and any subcontractor proposed to examine, 
       possess or transfer controlled goods are not registered, exempt or 
       excluded under the CGP at time of contract award, the Contractor and 
       any subcontractor shall, within seven (7) working days from receipt 
       of written notification of the contract award, ensure that the 
       required application(s) for registration or exemption are submitted 
       to the CGP.  No examination, possession or transfer of controlled 
       goods shall be performed until the Contractor has provided proof, 
       satisfactory to the Contracting Authority, that the Contractor and 
       any subcontractor are registered, exempt or excluded under the CGP.

       Failure of the Contractor to provide proof, satisfactory to the 
       Contracting Authority, that the Contractor and any subcontractor are 
       registered, exempt or excluded under the CGP, within thirty (30) 
       days from receipt of written notification of contract award, shall 
       be a default under the Contract except to the extent that Canada is 
       responsible for the failure due to delay in processing the 
       application.

3.     The Contractor and any subcontractor must maintain registration, 
       exemption or exclusion from the CGP for the duration of the Contract 
       and in any event for so long as they will examine, possess or 
       transfer controlled goods.
