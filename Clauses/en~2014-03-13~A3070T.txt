<p>The evaluation team will determine first if there are two (2)
or more bids with a valid Canadian content certification. In that
event, the evaluation process will be limited to the bids with the
certification; otherwise, all bids will be evaluated. If some of
the bids with a valid certification are declared non-responsive, or
are withdrawn, and less than two responsive bids with a valid
certification remain, the evaluation will continue among those bids
with a valid certification. If all bids with a valid certification
are subsequently declared non-responsive, or are withdrawn, then
all the other bids received will be evaluated.</p>
