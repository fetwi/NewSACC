<h2 id="standard-clauses-and-conditions">2035 02 (2008-05-12) Standard clauses and conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-38.2/" rel="external">Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</a></cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 16, the clauses and conditions
        identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
        incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
        expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="powers-of-canada">2035 03 (2008-05-12) Powers of Canada</h2>
<p>All rights, remedies, powers and discretions granted or acquired
        by Canada under the Contract or by law are cumulative, not
        exclusive.</p>
<h2 id="status-of-the-contractor">2035 04 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent contractor engaged by Canada to
        perform the Work. Nothing in the Contract is intended to create a
        partnership, a joint venture or an agency between Canada and the
        other Party or Parties. The Contractor must not represent itself as
        an agent or representative of Canada to anyone. Neither the
        Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee or
        agent of Canada. The Contractor is responsible for all deductions
        and remittances required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2 id="conduct-of-the-work">2035 05 (2012-03-02) Conduct of the Work</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contractor represents and warrants that: <ol type="a">
<li>it is competent to perform the Work;</li>
<li>it has everything necessary to perform the Work, including the resources, facilities, labour, technology, equipment, and materials; and</li>
<li>it has the necessary qualifications, including knowledge, skill, know-how and experience, and the ability to use them effectively to perform the Work.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Contractor must: <ol type="a">
<li>perform the Work diligently and efficiently;</li>
<li>except for Government Property, supply everything necessary to perform the Work;</li>
<li>use, as a minimum, quality assurance procedures, inspections and controls generally used and recognized by the industry to ensure the degree of quality required by the Contract;</li>
<li>select and employ a sufficient number of qualified people;</li>
<li>perform the Work in accordance with standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in full conformity with the Specifications and all the requirements of the Contract;</li>
<li>provide effective and efficient supervision to ensure that the quality of workmanship meets the requirements of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Work must not be performed by any person who, in the opinion of Canada, is incompetent, unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly.</li>
<li>All services rendered under the Contract must, at the time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform to the requirements of the Contract. If the Contractor is required to correct or replace the Work or any part of the Work, it will be at no cost to Canada.</li>
<li>Canada's facilities, equipment and personnel are not available to the Contractor to perform the Work unless the Contract specifically provides for it. The Contractor is responsible for advising the Contracting Authority in advance if it requires access to Canada's facilities, equipment or personnel to perform the Work. The Contractor must comply and ensure that its employees and subcontractors comply with all security measures, standing orders, policies or other rules in force at the site where the Work is performed.</li>
<li>Unless the Contracting Authority orders the Contractor to suspend the Work or part of the Work pursuant to section 28, the Contractor must not stop or suspend the Work or part of the Work pending the settlement of any dispute between the Parties about the Contract.</li>
<li>The Contractor must provide all reports that are required by the Contract and any other information that Canada may reasonably require from time to time.</li>
<li>The Contractor is fully responsible for performing the Work. Canada will not be responsible for any negative consequences or extra costs if the Contractor follows any advice given by Canada unless the Contracting Authority provides the advice to the Contractor in writing and includes a statement specifically relieving the Contractor of any responsibility for negative consequences or extra costs that might result from following the advice.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="subcontracts">2035 06 (2013-06-27) Subcontracts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Except as provided in subsection 2, the Contractor must obtain the Contracting Authority's written consent before subcontracting or permitting the subcontracting of any part of the Work. A subcontract includes a contract entered into by any subcontractor at any tier to perform any part of the Work.</li>
<li>The Contractor is not required to obtain consent for subcontracts specifically authorized in the Contract. The Contractor may also without the consent of the Contracting Authority: <ol type="a">
<li>purchase "off-the-shelf" items and any standard articles and materials that are ordinarily produced by manufacturers in the normal course of business;</li>
<li>subcontract any portion of the Work as is customary in the carrying out of similar contracts; and;</li>
<li>permit its subcontractors at any tier to make purchases or subcontract as permitted in paragraphs (a) and (b).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In any subcontract other than a subcontract referred to in paragraph 2.(a), the Contractor must, unless the Contracting Authority agrees in writing, ensure that the subcontractor is bound by conditions compatible with and, in the opinion of the Contracting Authority, not less favourable to Canada than the conditions of the Contract, with the exception of requirements under the Federal Contractors Program for employment equity which only apply to the Contractor.</li>
<li>Even if Canada consents to a subcontract, the Contractor is responsible for performing the Contract and Canada is not responsible to any subcontractor. The Contractor is responsible for any matters or things done or provided by any subcontractor under the Contract and for paying any subcontractors for any part of the Work they perform.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specifications">2035 07 (2008-05-12) Specifications</h2>
<ol>
<li>All Specifications provided by Canada or on behalf of Canada to the Contractor in connection with the Contract belong to Canada and must be used by the Contractor only for the purpose of performing the Work.</li>
<li>If the Contract provides that Specifications furnished by the Contractor must be approved by Canada, that approval will not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to meet all requirements of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="replacement-of-specific-individuals">2035 08 (2008-05-12) Replacement of specific individuals</h2>
<ol>
<li>If specific individuals are identified in the Contract to perform the Work, the Contractor must provide the services of those individuals unless the Contractor is unable to do so for reasons beyond its control.</li>
<li>If the Contractor is unable to provide the services of any specific individual identified in the Contract, it must provide a replacement with similar qualifications and experience. The replacement must meet the criteria used in the selection of the Contractor and be acceptable to Canada. The Contractor must, as soon as possible, give notice to the Contracting Authority of the reason for replacing the individual and provide: <ol type="a">
<li>the name, qualifications and experience of the proposed replacement; and</li>
<li>proof that the proposed replacement has the required security clearance granted by Canada, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Contractor must not, in any event, allow performance of the Work by unauthorized replacement persons. The Contracting Authority may order that a replacement stop performing the Work. In such a case, the Contractor must immediately comply with the order and secure a further replacement in accordance with subsection 2. The fact that the Contracting Authority does not order that a replacement stop performing the Work does not relieve the Contractor from its responsibility to meet the requirements of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="time-of-the-essence">2035 09 (2008-05-12) Time of the essence</h2>
<p>It is essential that the Work be performed within or at the time
        stated in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="excusable-delay">2035 10 (2014-09-25) Excusable delay</h2>
<ol>
<li>A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any obligation under the Contract that is caused by an event that <ol type="a">
<li>is beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor,</li>
<li>could not reasonably have been foreseen,</li>
<li>could not reasonably have been prevented by means reasonably available to the Contractor, and</li>
<li>occurred without the fault or neglect of the Contractor,</li>
</ol>
<p>will be considered an "Excusable Delay" if the Contractor advises the Contracting Authority of the occurrence of the delay or of the likelihood of the delay as soon as the Contractor becomes aware of it. The Contractor must also advise the Contracting Authority, within 15 working days, of all the circumstances relating to the delay and provide to the Contracting Authority for approval a clear work around plan explaining in detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.</p>
</li>
<li>Any delivery date or other date that is directly affected by an Excusable Delay will be postponed for a reasonable time that will not exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</li>
<li>However, if an Excusable Delay has continued for 30 days or more, the Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate the Contract. In such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other loss arising out of the termination or the event that contributed to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</li>
<li>Unless Canada has caused the delay by failing to meet an obligation under the Contract, Canada will not be responsible for any costs incurred by the Contractor or any of its subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</li>
<li>If the Contract is terminated under this section, the Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting Authority, any completed parts of the Work not delivered and accepted before the termination and anything that the Contractor has acquired or produced specifically to perform the Contract. Canada will pay the Contractor: <ol type="a">
<li>the value, of all completed parts of the Work delivered to and accepted by Canada, based on the Contract Price, including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee included in the Contract Price; and</li>
<li>the Cost to the Contractor that Canada considers reasonable in respect of anything else delivered to and accepted by Canada.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total amount paid by Canada under the Contract to the date of termination and any amounts payable under this subsection must not exceed the Contract Price.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="inspection-and-acceptance-of-the-work">2035 11 (2014-09-25) Inspection and acceptance of the Work</h2>
<ol>
<li>All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada. Inspection and acceptance of the Work by Canada do not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for defects or other failures to meet the requirements of the Contract. Canada will have the right to reject any Work that is not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract and require its correction or replacement at the Contractor's expense.</li>
<li>The Contractor must provide representatives of Canada access to all locations where any part of the Work is being performed at any time during working hours. Representatives of Canada may make examinations and such tests of the Work as they may think fit. The Contractor must provide all assistance and facilities, test pieces, samples and documentation that the representatives of Canada may reasonably require for the carrying out of the inspection. The Contractor must forward such test pieces and samples to such person or location as Canada specifies.</li>
<li>The Contractor must inspect and approve any part of the Work before submitting it for acceptance or delivering it to Canada. The Contractor must keep accurate and complete inspection records that must be made available to Canada on request. Representatives of Canada may make copies and take extracts of the records during the performance of the Contract and for up to three years after the end of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="invoice-submission">2035 12 (2013-03-21) Invoice submission</h2>
<ol>
<li>Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name. The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment; invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</li>
<li>Invoices must show: <ol type="a">
<li>the date, the name and address of the client department, item or reference numbers, deliverable/description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number (CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial code(s);</li>
<li>details of expenditures (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price, fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as applicable) in accordance with the Basis of Payment, exclusive of Applicable Taxes;</li>
<li>deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li>the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li>if applicable, the method of shipment together with date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Applicable Taxes must be specified on all invoices as a separate item along with corresponding registration numbers from the tax authorities. All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which Applicable Taxes do not apply, must be identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li>By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taxes">2035 13 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol>
<li> Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes. </li>
<li> Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation. The Contractor agrees to remit to appropriate tax authorities any amounts of Applicable Taxes paid or due. </li>
<li> The Contractor is not entitled to use Canada’s exemptions from any tax, such as provincial sales taxes, unless otherwise specified by law. The Contractor must pay applicable provincial sales tax, ancillary taxes, and any commodity tax, on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with applicable legislation), including for material incorporated into real property. </li>
<li> In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award. However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change. </li>
<li>Tax Withholding of 15 Percent – Canada Revenue Agency </li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Act</a></cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Regulations</a></cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html" rel="external">Canada Revenue Agency</a></cite>. The amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada. </p>
<h2 id="transportation-costs">2035 14 (2010-01-11) Transportation costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
        and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
        must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
        with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
        separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-carriers-liability">2035 15 (2010-01-11) Transportation carriers' liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
        precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
        transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
        to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
        Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
        charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
        shipment.</p>
<h2 id="payment-period">2035 16 (2014-09-25) Payment period</h2>
<ol>
<li>Canada's standard payment period is 30 days. The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is considered overdue on the 31st day following that date and interest will be paid automatically in accordance with the section 17.</li>
<li>If the content of the invoice and its substantiating documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within 15 days will only result in the date specified in subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interest-on-overdue-accounts">2035 17 (2008-12-12) Interest on overdue accounts</h2>
<ol>
<li>For the purpose of this section: <dl> <dt>"Average Rate"</dt>
<dd>means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank Rates in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time each day during the calendar month immediately before the calendar month in which payment is made;</dd> <dt>"Bank Rate"</dt>
<dd>means the rate of interest established from time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short term advances to members of the Canadian Payments Association;</dd> <dt>"date of payment"</dt>
<dd>means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada to pay any amount under the Contract;</dd> <dt>an amount becomes "overdue"</dt>
<dd>when it is unpaid on the first day following the day on which it is due and payable according to the Contract.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Canada will pay to the Contractor simple interest at the Average Rate plus 3 percent per year on any amount that is overdue, from the date that amount becomes overdue until the day before the date of payment, inclusive. The Contractor is not required to provide notice to Canada for interest to be payable.</li>
<li>Canada will pay interest in accordance with this section only if Canada is responsible for the delay in paying the Contractor. Canada will not pay interest on overdue advance payments.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compliance-with-applicable-laws">2035 18 (2008-05-12) Compliance with applicable laws</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contractor must comply with all laws applicable to the performance of the Contract. The Contractor must provide evidence of compliance with such laws to Canada at such times as Canada may reasonably request.</li>
<li>The Contractor must obtain and maintain at its own cost all permits, licenses, regulatory approvals and certificates required to perform the Work. If requested by the Contracting Authority, the Contractor must provide a copy of any required permit, license, regulatory approvals or certificate to Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ownership">2035 19 (2008-05-12) Ownership</h2>
<ol>
<li>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, the Work or any part of the Work belongs to Canada after delivery and acceptance by or on behalf of Canada.</li>
<li>However if any payment is made to the Contractor for or on account of any Work, either by way of progress or milestone payments, that work paid for by Canada belongs to Canada upon such payment being made. This transfer of ownership does not constitute acceptance by Canada of the Work or any part of the Work and does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in accordance with the Contract.</li>
<li>Despite any transfer of ownership, the Contractor is responsible for any loss or damage to the Work or any part of the Work until it is delivered to Canada in accordance with the Contract. Even after delivery, the Contractor remains responsible for any loss or damage to any part of the Work caused by the Contractor or any subcontractor.</li>
<li>Upon transfer of ownership to the Work or any part of the Work to Canada, the Contractor must, if requested by Canada, establish to Canada's satisfaction that the title is free and clear of all claims, liens, attachments, charges or encumbrances. The Contractor must execute any conveyances and other instruments necessary to perfect the title that Canada may require.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="copyright">2035 20 (2008-05-12) Copyright</h2>
<p>In this section, "<dfn>Material</dfn>" means anything that is
        created by the Contractor as part of the Work under the Contract,
        that is required by the Contract to be delivered to Canada and in
        which copyright subsists. <dfn>"Material"</dfn> does not include anything created by the Contractor before the date of the Contract.</p>
<p>Copyright in the Material belongs to Canada and the Contractor
        must include the copyright symbol and either of the following
        notice on the Material: © Her Majesty the Queen in right of
        Canada <var>(year)</var> or <span lang="fr-CA">© Sa Majesté la Reine du chef du Canada <var>(année)</var></span>.</p>
<p>The Contractor must not use, copy, divulge or publish any
        Material except as is necessary to perform the Contract. The
        Contractor must execute any conveyance and other documents relating
        to copyright in the Material as Canada may require.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide at the request of Canada a written
        permanent waiver of moral rights, in a form acceptable to Canada,
        from every author that contributed to the Material. If the
        Contractor is the author of the Material, the Contractor
        permanently waives its moral rights in the Material.</p>
<h2 id="translation-of-documentation">2035 21 (2008-05-12) Translation of documentation</h2>
<p>The Contractor agrees that Canada may translate in the other
        official language any documentation delivered to Canada by the
        Contractor that does not belong to Canada under section 20. The
        Contractor acknowledges that Canada owns the translation and that
        it is under no obligation to provide any translation to the
        Contractor. Canada agrees that any translation must include any
        copyright notice and any proprietary right notice that was part of
        the original. Canada acknowledges that the Contractor is not
        responsible for any technical errors or other problems that may
        arise as a result of the translation.</p>

The Contractor acknowledges that all this information remains the property of Canada or the third party, as the case may be.

<li>is or becomes known to a Party from a source other than the other Party, except any source that is known to be under an obligation to the other Party not to disclose the information; or</li>
<li>is developed by a Party without use of the information of the other Party.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Wherever possible, the Contractor must mark or identify any proprietary information delivered to Canada under the Contract as "Property of <var>(Contractor's name)</var>, permitted Government uses defined under Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC) Contract <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <var>(fill in Contract Number)</var>". Canada will not be liable for any unauthorized use or disclosure of information that could have been so marked or identified and was not.</li>

<li>If the Contract, the Work, or any information referred to in subsection 1 is identified as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, or PROTECTED, by Canada, representatives of Canada are entitled to inspect the Contractor's premises and the premises of a subcontractor at any tier for security purposes at any time during the term of the Contract. The Contractor must comply with, and ensure that any subcontractor complies with, all written instructions issued by Canada dealing with the material so identified, including any requirement that employees of the Contractor or of any subcontractor execute and deliver declarations relating to reliability screenings, security clearances and other procedures.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="government-property">2035 23 (2008-05-12) Government Property</h2>
<ol>
<li>All Government Property must be used by the Contractor solely for the purpose of the Contract and remains the property of Canada. The Contractor must maintain adequate accounting records of all Government Property and, whenever feasible, mark it as being the property of Canada.</li>
<li>The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care of all Government Property while it is in its possession or subject to its control. The Contractor is responsible for any loss or damage resulting from its failure to do so other than loss or damage caused by ordinary wear and tear.</li>
<li>All Government Property, unless it is installed or incorporated in the Work, must be returned to Canada on demand. All scrap and all waste materials, articles or things that are Government Property must, unless provided otherwise in the Contract, remain the property of Canada and must be disposed of only as directed by Canada.</li>
<li>At the time of completion of the Contract, and if requested by the Contracting Authority, the Contractor must provide to Canada an inventory of all Government Property relating to the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="liability">2035 24 (2008-05-12) Liability</h2>
<p>The Contractor is liable for any damage caused by the
        Contractor, its employees, subcontractors, or agents to Canada or
        any third party. Canada is liable for any damage caused by Canada,
        its employees or agents to the Contractor or any third party. The
        Parties agree that no limitation of liability or indemnity
        provision applies to the Contract unless it is specifically
        incorporated in full text in the Articles of Agreement. Damage
        includes any injury to persons (including injury resulting in
        death) or loss of or damage to property (including real property)
        caused as a result of or during the performance of the
        Contract.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-property-infringement-and-royalties">2035 25 (2008-05-12) Intellectual property infringement and royalties</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contractor represents and warrants that, to the best of its knowledge, neither it nor Canada will infringe any third party's intellectual property rights in performing or using the Work, and that Canada will have no obligation to pay royalties of any kind to anyone in connection with the Work.</li>
<li>If anyone makes a claim against Canada or the Contractor concerning intellectual property infringement or royalties related to the Work, that Party agrees to notify the other Party in writing immediately. If anyone brings a claim against Canada, according to <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/J-2/" rel="external">Department of Justice Act</a></cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> J-2, the Attorney General of Canada must have the regulation and conduct of all litigation for or against Canada, but the Attorney General may request that the Contractor defend Canada against the claim. In either case, the Contractor agrees to participate fully in the defence and any settlement negotiations and to pay all costs, damages and legal costs incurred or payable as a result of the claim, including the amount of any settlement. Both Parties agree not to settle any claim unless the other Party first approves the settlement in writing.</li>
<li>The Contractor has no obligation regarding claims that were only made because: <ol type="a">
<li>Canada modified the Work or part of the Work without the Contractor's consent or used the Work or part of the Work without following a requirement of the Contract; or</li>
<li>Canada used the Work or part of the Work with a product that the Contractor did not supply under the Contract (unless that use is described in the Contract or the manufacturer's specifications); or</li>
<li>the Contractor used equipment, drawings, specifications or other information supplied to the Contractor by Canada (or by someone authorized by Canada); or</li>
<li>the Contractor used a specific item of equipment or software that it obtained because of specific instructions from the Contracting Authority; however, this exception only applies if the Contractor has included the following language in its own contract with the supplier of that equipment or software: "<var>[Supplier name]</var> acknowledges that the purchased items will be used by the Government of Canada. If a third party claims that equipment or software supplied under this contract infringes any intellectual property right, <var>[supplier name]</var>, if requested to do so by either <var>[Contractor name]</var> or Canada, will defend both <var>[Contractor name]</var> and Canada against that claim at its own expense and will pay all costs, damages and legal fees payable as a result of that infringement." Obtaining this protection from the supplier is the Contractor's responsibility and, if the Contractor does not do so, it will be responsible to Canada for the claim.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If anyone claims that, as a result of the Work, the Contractor or Canada is infringing its intellectual property rights, the Contractor must immediately do one of the following: <ol type="a">
<li>take whatever steps are necessary to allow Canada to continue to use the allegedly infringing part of the Work; or</li>
<li>modify or replace the Work to avoid intellectual property infringement, while ensuring that the Work continues to meet all the requirements of the Contract; or</li>
<li>take back the Work and refund any part of the Contract Price that Canada has already paid.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Contractor determines that none of these alternatives can reasonably be achieved, or if the Contractor fails to take any of these steps within a reasonable amount of time, Canada may choose either to require the Contractor to do (c), or to take whatever steps are necessary to acquire the rights to use the allegedly infringing part(s) of the Work itself, in which case the Contractor must reimburse Canada for all the costs it incurs to do so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="amendment-and-waivers">2035 26 (2008-05-12) Amendment and waivers</h2>
<ol>
<li>To be effective, any amendment to the Contract must be done in writing by the Contracting Authority and the authorized representative of the Contractor.</li>
<li>While the Contractor may discuss any proposed modifications to the Work with other representatives of Canada, Canada will not be responsible for the cost of any modification unless it has been incorporated into the Contract in accordance with subsection 1.</li>
<li>A waiver will only be valid, binding or affect the rights of the Parties if it is made in writing by, in the case of a waiver by Canada, the Contracting Authority and, in the case of a waiver by the Contractor, the authorized representative of the Contractor.</li>
<li>The waiver by a Party of a breach of any condition of the Contract will not be treated or interpreted as a waiver of any subsequent breach and therefore will not prevent that Party from enforcing of that term or condition in the case of a subsequent breach.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment">2035 27 (2008-05-12) Assignment</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contractor must not assign the Contract without first obtaining the written consent of the Contracting Authority. Any assignment made without that consent is void and will have no effect. The assignment will be effective upon execution of an assignment agreement signed by the Parties and the assignee.</li>
<li>Assignment of the Contract does not relieve the Contractor from any obligation under the Contract and it does not impose any liability upon Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="suspension-of-the-work">2035 28 (2014-09-25) Suspension of the Work</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contracting Authority may at any time, by written notice, order the Contractor to suspend or stop the Work or part of the Work under the Contract for a period of up to 180 days. The Contractor must immediately comply with any such order in a way that minimizes the cost of doing so. While such an order is in effect, the Contractor must not remove any part of the Work from any premises without first obtaining the written consent of the Contracting Authority. Within these 180 days, the Contracting Authority must either cancel the order or terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, under section 29 or section 30.</li>
<li>When an order is made under subsection 1, unless the Contracting Authority terminates the Contract by reason of default by the Contractor or the Contractor abandons the Contract, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid its additional costs incurred as a result of the suspension plus a fair and reasonable profit.</li>
<li>When an order made under subsection 1 is cancelled, the Contractor must resume work in accordance with the Contract as soon as practicable. If the suspension has affected the Contractor's ability to meet any delivery date under the Contract, the date for performing the part of the Work affected by the suspension will be extended for a period equal to the period of suspension plus a period, if any, that in the opinion of the Contracting Authority, following consultation with the Contractor, is necessary for the Contractor to resume the Work. Any equitable adjustments will be made as necessary to any affected conditions of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="default-by-the-contractor">2035 29 (2014-09-25) Default by the Contractor</h2>
<ol>
<li>If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its obligations under the Contract, the Contracting Authority may, by giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate for default the Contract or part of the Contract. The termination will take effect immediately or at the expiration of a cure period specified in the notice, if the Contractor has not cured the default to the satisfaction of the Contracting Authority within that cure period.</li>
<li>If the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit of any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or if a receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a receiving order is made against the Contractor, or an order is made or a resolution passed for the winding-up of the Contractor, the Contracting Authority may, to the extent permitted by the laws of Canada, by giving written notice to the Contractor, immediately terminate for default the Contract or part of the Contract.</li>
<li>If Canada gives notice under subsection 1 or 2, the Contractor will have no claim for further payment except as provided in this section. The Contractor will be liable to Canada for all losses and damages suffered by Canada because of the default or occurrence upon which the notice was based, including any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work from another source. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</li>
<li>Upon termination of the Contract under this section, the Contracting Authority may require the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting Authority, any completed parts of the Work, not delivered and accepted before the termination and anything the Contractor has acquired or produced specifically to perform the Contract. In such a case, subject to the deduction of any claim that Canada may have against the Contractor arising under the Contract or out of the termination, Canada will pay or credit to the Contractor: <ol type="a">
<li>the value, of all completed parts of the Work delivered to and accepted by Canada, based on the Contract Price, including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee included in the Contract Price; and</li>
<li>the cost to the Contractor that Canada considers reasonable in respect of anything else delivered to and accepted by Canada.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total amount paid by Canada under the Contract to the date of the termination and any amount payable under this subsection must not exceed the Contract Price.</p>
</li>
<li>Title to everything for which payment is made to the Contractor will, once payment is made, pass to Canada unless it already belongs to Canada under any other provision of the Contract.</li>
<li>If the Contract is terminated for default under subsection 1, but it is later determined that grounds did not exist for a termination for default, the notice will be considered a notice of termination for convenience issued under subsection 1 of section 30.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="termination-for-convenience">2035 30 (2020-05-28) Termination for convenience</h2>
<ol>
<li>At any time before the completion of the Work, the Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate for convenience the Contract or part of the Contract. Once such a notice of termination for convenience is given, the Contractor must comply with the requirements of the termination notice. If the Contract is terminated in part only, the Contractor must proceed to complete any part of the Work that is not affected by the termination notice. The termination will take effect immediately or, as the case may be, at the time specified in the termination notice.</li>
<li>If a termination notice is given pursuant to subsection 1, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid, for costs that have been reasonably and properly incurred to perform the Contract to the extent that the Contractor has not already been paid or reimbursed by Canada. The Contractor agrees that it will only be paid the following amounts:
            <ol type="a">
<li>on the basis of the Contract Price, for any part of the Work completed that is inspected and accepted in accordance with the Contract, whether completed before, or after the termination in accordance with the instructions contained in the termination notice;</li>
<li>the Cost incurred by the Contractor plus a fair and reasonable profit thereon as determined by Canada in accordance with the profit provisions found in <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Supply Manual section <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/10/65">10.65 Calculation of profit on negotiated contracts</a>, for any part of the Work commenced, but not completed, prior to the date of the termination notice. The Contractor agrees that it is not entitled to any anticipated profit on any part of the Contract terminated; and</li>
<li>all costs incidental to the termination of the Work incurred by the Contractor but not including the cost of severance payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer required, except wages that the Contractor is obligated by statute to pay.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Canada may reduce the payment in respect of any part of the Work, if upon inspection, it does not meet the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li>The total of the amounts, to which the Contractor is entitled to be paid under this section, together with any amounts paid, due or becoming due to the Contractor must not exceed the Contract Price. The Contractor will have no claim for damages, compensation, loss of profit, interest, allowance arising out of any termination notice given by Canada under this section except to the extent that this section expressly provides. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</li>

<li>If the Contract includes payment for time spent by the Contractor, its employees, representatives, agents or subcontractors performing the Work, the Contractor must keep a record of the actual time spent each day by each individual performing any part of the Work.</li>
<li>Unless Canada has consented in writing to its disposal, the Contractor must retain all the information described in this section for six years after it receives the final payment under the Contract, or until the settlement of all outstanding claims and disputes, whichever is later. During this time, the Contractor must make this information available for audit, inspection and examination by the representatives of Canada, who may make copies and take extracts. The Contractor must provide all reasonably required facilities for any audit and inspection and must furnish all the information as the representatives of Canada may from time to time require to perform a complete audit of the Contract.</li>
<li>The amount claimed under the contract, calculated in accordance with the Basis of Payment provision in the Articles of Agreement, is subject to government audit both before and after payment is made. If an audit is performed after payment, the Contractor agrees to repay any overpayment immediately on demand by Canada. Canada may hold back, deduct and set off any credits owing and unpaid under this section from any money that Canada owes to the Contractor at any time (including under other contracts). If Canada does not choose to exercise this right at any given time, Canada does not lose this right.</li>
