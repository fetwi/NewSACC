<li value="1">This section applies despite any other provision of
the Contract and replaces the section of the general conditions
entitled "Liability". Any reference in this section to damages
caused by the Contractor also includes damages caused by its
employees, as well as its subcontractors, agents, and
representatives, and any of their employees.</li>
<li value="2">Whether the claim is based in contract, tort, or
another cause of action, the Contractor's liability for all damages
suffered by Canada caused by the Contractor's performance of or
failure to perform the Contract is limited to
$<var>___________</var>. This limit applies not only to damages to
Canada, but also limits the amount that the Contractor must
reimburse to Canada if Canada is required, as a result of joint and
several liability, to pay a third party in respect of damages
caused by the Contractor. This limitation of the Contractor's
liability does not apply to:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">any infringement of intellectual property rights;
or</li>
<li value="2">any breach of warranty obligations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">Despite the above, this article does not require
Canada to reimburse the Contractor for amounts that the Contractor
is required by law to pay directly to any third party, even if
those amounts are for damages that relate to the Contractor's
performance of or failure to perform the Contract. Canada is not
required to defend the Contractor against any third party claims
made directly against the Contractor, even if Canada is also a
party to the litigation.</li>
