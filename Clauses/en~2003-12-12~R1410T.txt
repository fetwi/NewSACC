<strong>GI 2   (30/05/03)    Overview of Selection Procedure</strong>

<strong>2.1    Proposal</strong> 
1.     Proposals are submitted following a "two-envelope" procedure, in 
       which Proponents submit the "technical" component of their proposal 
       in one envelope and the proposed price of the services (price 
       proposal) in a second envelope.

2.     The information that Proponents are required to provide is set out 
       in detail elsewhere in the RFP.

3.     In response to the RFP, interested Proponents submit a proposal in 
       which they:

       (a)    indicate whether the proposal is submitted by an individual 
              firm or by a joint venture;

       (b)    if the proposal is submitted by a joint venture, describe the 
              proposed legal and working relationships of the joint venture 
              and the benefits to be gained by the formation of the joint 
              venture;

       (c)    identify the prime consultants and key sub consultants and 
              specialists proposed for inclusion in the Consultant Team, 
              and the proposed organizational structure of the Team;

       (d)    describe the extent to which proposed members of the 
              Consultant Team have successfully performed services for 
              projects comparable to the project which is the subject of 
              the proposal;

       (e)    identify the professional accreditation, experience, 
              expertise and competence of the proposed Consultant Team and 
              the Key Personnel proposed to be assigned to perform the 
              required services.

       (f)    comply with all other requirements set out in the RFP.

<strong>2.2    Proposal Evaluation and Rating</strong>

1.     Technical components of all responsive proposals are reviewed, 
       evaluated and rated by a Public Works and Government Services Canada 
       (PWGSC) Evaluation Board in accordance with the criteria, components 
       and weight factors set out in the RFP.  Upon completion of the 
       evaluation, Technical Ratings are established.

2.     Proposals achieving the minimum Technical Score specified in the 
       Submission Requirements and Evaluation section of the RFP are 
       further considered.

3.     The price envelopes of all responsive proposals are opened upon 
       completion of the technical evaluation.  An average price is 
       determined by adding all the price proposals together and dividing 
       the total by the number of price proposals opened.

4.     All price proposals which are greater than twenty-five percent (25%) 
       above the average price will cause their respective complete 
       proposals to be set aside and receive no further consideration.

5.     The remaining price proposals are rated as follows:

       (a)    The lowest price proposal receives a Price Rating of 100.

       (b)    The second, third, fourth and fifth lowest prices receive 
              Price Ratings of 80, 60, 40, and 20 respectively.  All other 
              price proposals receive a Price Rating of 0.

       (c)    On the rare occasion where two (or more) price proposals are 
              identical, these price proposals receive the same rating and 
              the corresponding number of following ratings are skipped. 

       (d)    The Price Rating is multiplied by a predetermined percentage 
              factor to establish a Price Score.

6.     A price proposal in excess of any maximum funding limit, when this 
       limit has been set in the Supplementary Instructions to Proponents, 
       will result in disqualification of the complete proposal.

<strong>2.3    Total Score</strong>

1.     The total overall score (Total Score) assigned to each Proponent's 
       complete proposal is calculated as the aggregate of: 
       (a)    the Technical Score (first envelope of the proposal), and

       (b)    the Price Score (second envelope of the proposal).

2.     The Proponent receiving the highest Total Score is the first entity 
       that the PWGSC Evaluation Board will recommend be approached in 
       order to finalize details of an agreement for the provision of the 
       required services.

<strong>2.4    Notification</strong>

PWGSC normally expects to advise in writing unsuccessful Proponents within 
one week after PWGSC has entered into a contractual arrangement with the 
successful Proponent.


<strong>GI 3   (30/05/03)    Procurement Business Number </strong>

1.     For procurement purposes, the Government of Canada uses a unique 
       Procurement Business Number (PBN) to identify a company and its 
       branches, divisions, or offices, where appropriate.  The PBN is 
       created using the entity's Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
       Business Number. 

2.     All Canadian companies are required to have a PBN prior to contract 
       award in order to receive a PWGSC contract.  In exceptional 
       circumstances, PWGSC may decide to award, at its own discretion, a 
       contract to a company without a PBN.  Non-Canadian companies are 
       strongly encouraged to obtain a PBN.

3.     Companies may register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration 
       Information (SRI) service on line at the Contracts Canada Internet 
       site at: <strong class="wsStyleUnderline"><a href="http://contractscanada.gc.ca" rel="external">http://contractscanada.gc.ca</a></strong>.  In order for companies to be 
       sourced by government buyers, they must complete the registration 
       process and activate their account in the SRI service.

4.     For non-Internet registration, contact the Contracts Canada InfoLine 
       at 1-800-811-1148 or (819) 956-3440, in the National Capital Area, 
       to obtain the telephone number of the nearest Supplier Registration 
       Agent. 


<strong>GI 4   (30/05/03)    Responsive Proposals</strong>

To be considered responsive, a proposal must meet all of the mandatory 
requirements set out in the RFP.  No further consideration in the selection 
procedure will be given to a Proponent submitting a non-responsive proposal.


<strong>GI 5   (30/05/03)    Completion of Submission</strong>

The Proponent shall base the proposal on the applicable proposal documents 
listed in the Supplementary Instructions to Proponents.  It is the 
responsibility of the Proponent to obtain clarification of any terms, 
conditions or technical requirements contained in the RFP. 


<strong>GI 6   (30/05/03)    Proposal Price </strong>

1.     Unless specified otherwise elsewhere in the proposal documents:

       (a)    the price proposal shall be in Canadian currency, and

       (b)    the price proposal shall not include any amount for the Goods 
              and Services Tax  or the Harmonized Sales Tax as may be 
              applicable, and

       (c)    exchange rate fluctuation protection is not offered, and

       (d)    any request for exchange rate fluctuation protection will not 
              be considered, and will render the proposal non-responsive.


<strong>GI 7   (30/05/03)    Enquiries During the Solicitation Period</strong> 
1.     Any questions or requests for clarification during the solicitation 
       period must be submitted in writing by the prime contact of a 
       Proponent to the person identified on the front page of the Request 
       for Proposal.  Responses will be sent by PWGSC to the prime contact 
       of the Proponent, who will be responsible for internal distribution 
       as required within the Proponent's Consultant Team.

2.     To ensure equality of information provided to Proponents, answers to 
       significant enquiries will be forwarded simultaneously to each 
       Proponent.

3.     Enquiries are to be directed ONLY to the person referred to in 
       paragraph 1 above.  Non-compliance with this condition during the 
       solicitation period may, for that reason alone, result in the 
       disqualification of the proposal.


<strong>GI 8   (30/05/03)    Limitation of Submissions</strong>

1.     While there is no requirement for firms to participate in this 
       procurement in joint venture, they may elect to do so if they see 
       fit.  However, only one submission per proponent will be accepted, 
       whether it is submitted by a firm as an individual Proponent or by 
       that firm as part of a joint venture Proponent.  If more than one 
       submission is received from a firm acting either individually or in 
       joint venture, all such submissions shall be rejected and no further 
       consideration shall be given to the firm or to any proposed joint 
       venture of which the firm forms part.

2.     A joint venture is defined as an association of two or more parties 
       which combine their money, property, knowledge, skills, time or 
       other resources in a joint business enterprise agreeing to share the 
       profits and the losses and each having some degree of control over 
       the enterprise.

3.     An arrangement whereby Canada contracts directly with a prime 
       consultant who may retain sub-consultants or specialist consultants 
       to perform portions of the services is not a joint venture 
       arrangement.  A sub-consultant or specialist consultant firm may, 
       therefore, be proposed as part of the Consultant Team by more than 
       one Proponent.

4.     Notwithstanding paragraph 3. above, in order to avoid any conflict 
       of interest, or any perception of conflict of interest, no firm 
       acting as an individual Proponent or as part of a joint venture 
       Proponent, shall be proposed as a member of another Proponent's 
       Consultant Team, either as a sub-consultant or specialist consultant 
       or as part of another joint venture Proponent.  Failure to comply 
       with this limitation will result in all submissions so involved 
       being rejected.

5.     Any joint venture entered into for the provision of professional 
       services or other services must be in full compliance with the 
       requirements of any provincial or territorial law pertaining thereto 
       in the Province or Territory in which the project is located.


<strong>GI 9   (30/05/03)    Licensing Requirements</strong>

1.     Consultant Team members and Key Personnel shall be, or be eligible 
       to be licensed, certified or otherwise authorized to provide the 
       necessary professional services to the full extent that may be 
       required by provincial or territorial law in the Province or 
       Territory in which the project is located.

2.     By virtue of submission of a proposal, the Proponent certifies that 
       the Proponent is satisfied that the proposed Consultant Team and Key 
       Personnel are in compliance with the requirements of paragraph 1.  
       The Proponent acknowledges that PWGSC reserves the right to verify 
       any information in this regard and that false or erroneous 
       certification may result in the proposal being declared 
       non-responsive.


<strong>GI 10  (30/05/03)    Eligibility Requirements</strong>

1.     Proponents are advised that a Proponent may be deemed to be 
       ineligible for selection at any time if :

       (a)    any firm or individual included in the Consultant Team has 
              been convicted under section 121 ("Frauds on the government" 
              &amp; "Contractor subscribing to election fund"), 124 ("Selling 
              or purchasing office"), or 418 ("Selling defective stores to 
              Her Majesty") of the Criminal Code; 
       (b)    the Proponent has been declared ineligible for selection, 
              following unsatisfactory performance in a previous project as 
              determined in accordance with the department's performance 
              review procedures;

       (c)    any firm or individual included in the Consultant Team has 
              been declared ineligible, for selection for work with the 
              department in accordance with the performance review 
              procedure referred to in paragraph 1.(b), which ineligibility 
              would render the individual ineligible for selection for the 
              work, or the portion of the work the individual is to perform, 
              under any contractual arrangement resulting from submission 
              of the proposal;

       (d)    with respect to current or prior transactions with the 
              Government of Canada,

              (i)    the Proponent is bankrupt or where, for whatever 
                     reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an 
                     extended period;

              (ii)   evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, 
                     fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with 
                     any law protecting individuals against any manner of 
                     discrimination, has been received with respect to any 
                     firm or individual included in the Consultant Team;

              (iii)  Canada has previously exercised or intends to exercise 
                     the contractual remedy of taking the services out of 
                     the consultant's hands with respect to any commission 
                     or contract with any firm or individual included in 
                     the Consultant Team;

              (iv)   Canada determines that the performance of the 
                     Proponent on other contracts or commissions, including 
                     the quality of the services provided and the quality 
                     and timeliness of the delivery of the project, is 
                     sufficiently poor to jeopardize the successful 
                     completion of the requirement which is the subject of 
                     the Initial Proposal.

2.     Where Canada intends to declare a firm ineligible pursuant to the 
       provisions contained in paragraph 1. above, other than provision 1.(
       b), the Minister will so inform the firm and provide the firm ten 
       (10) days within which to make representations, prior to making a 
       final decision regarding the ineligibility of the firm.


<strong>GI 11  (12/12/03)    Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity</strong>

1.     The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) 
       requires that some organizations making proposals for federal 
       government contracts, valued at $200,000 or more (including all 
       applicable taxes), make a formal commitment to implement employment 
       equity, as a condition precedent to the contract award.  If the 
       Proponent is subject to the Program, evidence of its commitment must 
       be provided prior to the award of any contract.

2.     Proponents that have been declared "Ineligible Proponents" by Human 
       Resources Development Canada-Labour (HRDC-Labour) are no longer 
       eligible to receive government contracts over the threshold for 
       solicitation of bids as set out in the <em>Government Contract 
       Regulations</em> (currently at $25,000, including all applicable taxes), 
       either as a result of a finding of non-compliance by HRDC-Labour, or 
       following their voluntary withdrawal from the Program for a reason 
       other than the reduction in their workforce.  Any proposals from 
       ineligible proponents will not be considered for award.

3.     The Proponent certifies its status with FCP-EE, as follows:

       The Proponent 

       (a)    is not subject to FCP-EE, having a workforce of less than 100 
              permanent full or part-time employees in Canada,

       (b)    is not subject to FCP-EE, being a regulated employer under 
              the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>;

       (c)    is subject to the requirements of FCP-EE, having a workforce 
              of 100 or more permanent full or part-time employees in 
              Canada, but has not previously obtained a certificate number 
              from HRDC-Labour, (having not submitted proposals on 
              requirements of $200,000 or more), in which case a duly 
              signed certificate of commitment is provided herewith 
              (attached);

       (d)    is subject to FCP-EE, and has a valid certification number as 
              follows: (e.g. has not been declared "Ineligible Proponent" 
              by HRDC-Labour).

4.     If the Proponent does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in 3. 
       (a) or (b), the Program requirements do apply, and as such, the 
       Proponent is required to submit HRDC-Labour form LAB 1186, 
       Certificate of Commitment to Implement Employment Equity, DULY 
       SIGNED or a valid Certificate number confirming its adherence to the 
       FCP-EE.

5.     The Proponent acknowledges that the Minister shall rely on this 
       certification to award the Contract.  Should a verification by the 
       Minister disclose a misrepresentation on the part of the Proponent, 
       the Minister shall have the right to treat any contract resulting 
       from this proposal as being in default, and to terminate it pursuant 
       to the Default provisions of the Contract.

6.     When submitting a proposal, the Proponent should complete and return 
       with the proposal the applicable certification for the "Federal 
       Contractors Program for Employment Equity" included in the 
       Declaration Form attached hereto.

7.     In all cases, the Proponent is required to produce evidence or 
       supporting information on demand prior to contract award, if such 
       evidence is not included with its proposal.

<strong>NOTE:  </strong><em>Information on the FCP-EE and the Certificate of Commitment (LAB 
       1186), are available on the following HRDC-Labour Website: </em><strong><em class="wsStyleUnderline">http://
       info.load-otea.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/workplace_equity/home.shtml</em></strong><em> and </em><em></em>
<em>       </em><strong><em class="wsStyleUnderline"><a href="http://www.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/fas-sfa/eforms/labnm1e.shtml#lab1168" rel="external">http://www.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/fas-sfa/eforms/labnm1e.shtml#lab1168</a></em></strong><em>, 
       respectively.</em>


<strong>GI 12  (30/05/03)    Insurance Requirements</strong>

1.     The successful Proponent shall be required to obtain and maintain 
       Professional Liability and Commercial General Liability insurance 
       coverage in accordance with the requirements set out elsewhere in 
       the proposal documents.

2.     No insurance requirement stipulated in the proposal documents should 
       be construed as limiting any insurance required by federal, 
       provincial or municipal law or as may be required under GC 9.1.  
       Neither should it limit any coverage which the successful Proponent 
       and other members of the Consultant Team may consider to be 
       necessary for their own protection or to fulfill their obligations.

3.     By virtue of submission of a proposal, the Proponent certifies that 
       the Proponent and the other members of the Consultant Team as may be 
       applicable are capable of obtaining, and will obtain and maintain 
       liability insurance in accordance with the requirements set out in 
       the proposal documents.


<strong>GI 13  (30/05/03)    Industrial and Facility Security Requirements</strong>

1.     Proponents shall take note of, and comply with, any industrial 
       security or facility security requirement which may be stipulated as 
       a requirement in the proposal and Agreement documents.  If 
       industrial security or facility security is required, employees and 
       staff of the Proponent and other members of the Consultant Team 
       involved in the project implementation must either be in possession 
       of, or agree to be investigated for, a valid, appropriate level of 
       personnel security screening that may be required under the 
       provisions of the RFP.

2.     If security screening is required, each person involved in the 
       project implementation must hold such security screening prior to 
       the commencement of any work.

3.     In all contractual arrangements with persons who are to be employed 
       in the performance of the services, the successful Proponent shall 
       make provision for the performance of any obligation that may be 
       imposed upon the Proponent under the provisions of this clause.


<strong>GI 14  (30/05/03)    Composition of Consultant Team</strong> 
By submitting a proposal, the Proponent represents and warrants that the 
entities and persons proposed in the proposal to perform the required 
services will be the entities and persons that will perform the services in 
the fulfillment of the project under any contractual arrangement arising 
from submission of the proposal.  If the Proponent has proposed any person 
in fulfillment of the project who is not an employee of the Proponent, the 
Proponent warrants that it has written permission from such person (or the 
employer of such person) to propose the services of such person in relation 
to the services to be performed.


<strong>GI 15  (30/05/03)    Submission of Proposal</strong>

1.     It is the Proponent's responsibility to:

       (a)    submit a signed proposal, duly completed, IN THE FORMAT 
              REQUESTED, on or before the closing date and time set;

       (b)    direct proposals ONLY to the designated office identified on 
              the front page of the RFP;

       (c)    the proposal shall be signed in accordance with the following 
              requirements:

              (i)    Corporation
                     The signatures of the authorized signatories shall be 
                     affixed and their names and titles typed or printed.

              (ii)   Partnership
                     The signatures of the partners shall be affixed and 
                     their names typed or printed.  If not all of the 
                     partners sign or if the signatory is not a partner
