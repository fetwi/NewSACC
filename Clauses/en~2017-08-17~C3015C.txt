<li value="1">The foreign currency component (FCC) is defined as the portion of the price or rate that will be directly affected by exchange rate fluctuation.  The <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> should include all related taxes, duties and other costs paid by the Bidder and which are to be included in the adjustment amount.</li>
<li value="2">For each line item where a <abbr title="Foreign currency component">FCC</abbr> is identified, Canada assumes the risks and benefits for exchange rate fluctuation, as shown in the Basis of Payment.  For such items, the exchange rate fluctuation amount is determined in accordance with the provision of this clause.</li>
<li value="3">The total price paid by Canada on each invoice will be adjusted at the time of payment. The exchange rate adjustment amount will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

<br/>where formula variables correspond to:

<dt><strong>i<sub>0</sub></strong></dt> <dd>Initial exchange rate (<abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per unit of foreign currency [for example <abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>1]).<br/>The initial exchange rate is set as the Bank of Canada rate on the solicitation closing date.
