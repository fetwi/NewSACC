<pre>The Contractor is to perform the Work in accordance with the research plan 
   reviewed and approved, or amended by a Human Ethics Review Committee 
   accepted by the Scientific Authority.  However, notwithstanding said 
   directions and the Contractor's undertaking to perform the Work, the 
   Contractor is to exercise due regard for the safety of human subjects, 
   and if, at any time in the Contractor's professional judgement, the life 
   or safety of a human subject may be in jeopardy, the Contractor is to 
   cease the specific activity which is the source of the jeopardy and 
   Canada agrees that it will not have cause of action against the 
   Contractor for failure to perform, provided the Minister is notified as 
   soon as possible.  In addition, the Contractor is to notify the Minister 
   by advising both the Scientific Authority and the Science Contracting 
   Officer, in writing, when, in the Contractor's professional judgement, 
   there are risks in the project itself, such that the Work should not 
   continue, so that appropriate action (either revision of the Statement 
   of Work or termination by mutual consent of the Contract) can be taken.
