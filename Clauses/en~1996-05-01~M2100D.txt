1.     Persons and companies in Canada are bound by economic sanctions 
       imposed by Canada by regulations passed pursuant to the <em>United 
       Nations Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. U-2, the <em>Special Economic Measures Act</em>, 
       S.C. 1992, c. 17 or the <em>Export and Import Permits Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, 
       c. E-19. As a result, the Government of Canada cannot accept 
       delivery of goods or services that originate, either directly or 
       indirectly, from the countries subject to economic sanctions. As of 
       this date, the following regulations implement economic sanctions:

       (a)    United Nations Iraq Regulations;
       (b)    United Nations Libya Regulations;
       (c)    United Nations Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Regulations;
       (d)    United Nations Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
              Montenegro)  Regulations.

2.     It is a condition of this Standing Offer and of any ensuing call-ups, 
       if any, that the Offeror not supply to the Government of Canada any 
       goods or services which are subject to economic sanctions as 
       described in paragraph (1) above.

3.     During the performance of any call-up under the Standing Offer, 
       should the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries 
       or the addition of a good or service to the list of sanctioned goods 
       and services prevent the Offeror from performing all or part of its 
       obligations pursuant to a call-up made against this Standing Offer, 
       the Offeror shall treat the situation as a  force majeure. The 
       Offeror shall forthwith inform Canada of the situation and follow 
       the procedures applicable to force majeure.
