<strong>CCC50  02     (06/91)       Powers of the Corporation</strong>

The <em>Corporation</em> is the agent of Her Majesty for all purposes of the <em>
Contract</em>. 
<strong>CCC50  03     (12/05/00)    Assignment and Subletting</strong>

1.     The Contractor shall not assign or sublet the <em>Contract</em> or any of the 
       Work without the prior written consent of the <em>Corporation</em> and any 
       assignment or subletting made without such consent shall be of no 
       effect provided that (unless the <em>Contract</em> or the <em>Corporation</em> directs 
       otherwise) the Contractor may sublet such portions of the <em>Work</em> as 
       are usually sublet in similar cases.  The Contractor shall promptly 
       furnish to the <em>Corporation</em> full particulars of all subcontracts.  No 
       assignment or subletting shall relieve the Contractor from any of 
       its obligations under the <em>Contract</em> or impose any liability upon Her 
       Majesty or the <em>Corporation</em> to an assignee or subcontractor.

2.     Subject to the foregoing, the <em>Contract</em> shall enure to the benefit of 
       and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Her Majesty 
       and of the Contractor, respectively.


<strong>CCC50  04     (06/91)       Conduct of the Work</strong>

1.     The Contractor shall diligently carry out the work, shall provide 
       efficient supervision and inspection thereof and shall be 
       responsible for seeing that the Work is of proper quality, material 
       and workmanship and satisfies the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>. 

2.     The nature and spirit of the <em>Contract</em> is to provide for the <em>Work</em> 
       therein enumerated to be fully completed in every detail for the 
       purpose designed; and the Contractor agrees to furnish any and every 
       thing necessary for such purpose, notwithstanding any omission in 
       the drawings or <em>Specifications</em>.

3.     The Contractor shall apply to the <em>Corporation</em> for any explanation 
       which the Contractor may require in regard to the meeting and intent 
       of any clause in the <em>Specifications</em> and <em>Contract</em>, and shall be held 
       responsible for any errors or losses consequent upon failure to 
       obtain such explanation.

4.     Drawings and <em>Specifications</em> are intended to complement each other, 
       so that if anything is shown on the drawings but not mentioned in 
       the <em>Specifications</em>, or vice versa, it is to be furnished and built 
       as though specifically set forth in both.  If any discrepancies are 
       discovered in the drawings, or any conflict between the drawings and 
       the <em>Specifications</em>, the same shall be referred to the <em>Corporation</em> 
       before proceeding with the <em>Work</em>.  Figured dimensions on drawings are 
       to have precedence.

5.     Materials used must conform to the <em>Specifications</em> whether shown on 
       the <em>Corporation's</em> or the Contractor's drawings or not.

6.     Approval by the <em>Corporation</em> of the Contractor's drawings shall not 
       relieve the Contractor of responsibility for corrections thereof, 
       nor for results arising from error or omission.

7.     No materials or parts shall be used or processed and no <em>Finished 
       Work</em> shall be submitted for acceptance or shall be delivered unless 
       or until approved by the Contractor's inspection staff and, wherever 
       practicable, marked with an approval stamp satisfactory to the <em>
       Inspector</em>.  The Contractor shall keep proper and adequate inspection 
       records which shall at all times be open to examination by the <em>
       Inspector</em> who may make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom.

8.     The <em>Corporation</em> and the Inspector shall have access to the <em>Work</em> at 
       all times and may make such tests of the <em>Work</em> as they may think fit.  
       The Contractor shall provide all assistance and facilities, test 
       pieces and samples which the <em>Corporation</em> or the Inspector may 
       require for the carrying out of any such tests.

9.     The Contractor shall not stop or suspend work pending the settlement 
       or determination (by arbitration or otherwise) of any differences 
       arising under the <em>Contract</em>.

 
<strong>CCC50  05     (06/91)       Inspector, the Final Judge of the Work</strong>

The <em>Inspector</em> shall be the final judge of the Work and of its quality and 
workmanship.  The <em>Inspector</em> shall have full power to reject or refuse to 
accept any <em>Finished Work</em> or parts or materials or work in process which the <em>
Inspector</em> considers are not in accordance with the requirements of the <em>
Contract</em>.  The <em>Inspector</em> shall also be the sole judge as to the meaning of 
the <em>Specifications</em>, if any. 


<strong>CCC50  06     (06/91)       Making Good Rejected Work</strong>

The Contractor shall forthwith at its own expense make good any work which 
the <em>Inspector</em> may have refused to accept or, alternatively, at the option 
of the <em>Corporation</em>, all amounts previously paid to the Contractor in 
respect of <em>Work</em> rejected or not accepted shall forthwith be repaid by the 
Contractor.


<strong>CCC50  07     (06/91)       Acceptance and Delivery</strong>

Final acceptance by the <em>Inspector</em> of any <em>Finished Work</em> shall be deemed to 
be delivery to and acceptance by Her Majesty of the <em>Work</em> so accepted and 
such acceptance shall be a condition precedent to delivery.  Provided 
always that if the <em>Agreement</em> provides for a particular place or manner of 
delivery, such delivery shall not be complete unless or until made in 
accordance therewith.  Upon delivery, title to the <em>Work</em> delivered shall 
vest in Her Majesty if not already so vested.  The right of the Inspector 
to refuse final acceptance of any of the <em>Work</em> shall not be affected by any 
prior inspection, approval or acceptance of any parts, materials or work in 
process or any other <em>Finished Work</em>.


<strong>CCC50  08     (06/91)       Warranty</strong>

Without restricting any other term of the <em>Contract</em> or any warranty 
stipulated or implied by law, the Contractor shall, at its own expense, 
replace any articles, parts or materials included in the <em>Work</em> (not 
including any <em>Government Issue</em>) which at any time within eighteen (18) 
months from the delivery thereof become defective as a result of faulty or 
inefficient manufacture, materials or workmanship.


<strong>CCC50  09     (06/91)       Government Issue</strong>

1.     All items comprised in any <em>Government Issue</em> shall be used by the 
       Contractor solely for the purposes of the <em>Contract</em> and shall always 
       be and remain the property of Her Majesty and, wherever feasible, 
       the Contractor shall mark the same as being Her Majesty's property.

2.     Any items of <em>Government Issue</em> found to be damaged or defective shall 
       be replaced by Her Majesty upon the <em>Inspector</em> certifying in writing 
       to the <em>Corporation</em> that the damage or defect is not due to the fault 
       or negligence of the Contractor.  If the <em>Inspector</em> certifies that 
       more than five (5) per cent of the total <em>Government Issue</em> of the 
       same kind or type is damaged or defective (otherwise than as a 
       result of the fault or negligence of the Contractor), Her Majesty 
       shall reimburse the Contractor for any loss incurred by the 
       Contractor which is directly attributable to such damaged or 
       defective items in excess of five (5) per cent.

3.     All <em>Government Issue</em> (except such as are installed or incorporated 
       in the Work) shall be returned to the <em>Corporation</em> upon demand, in 
       the same condition as when supplied to the Contractor; provided that 
       the Contractor shall not be responsible for any loss or damage 
       resulting from ordinary wear and tear or from causes beyond the 
       Contractor's reasonable control.


<strong>CCC50  10     (06/91)       Scrap, etc.</strong>
 
All scrap and waste materials derived from any Government Issue, or from 
any other materials, articles or things which are the property of Her 
Majesty, shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, remain the 
property of Her Majesty and shall be disposed of only as prescribed by the 
Corporation.


<strong>CCC50  11     (06/91)       Care of Crown Property; Insurance</strong>

1.     The Contractor shall take reasonable and proper care of any and all 
       property owned by Her Majesty which is from time to time in the 
       Contractor's custody or control and shall be responsible for any 
       loss thereof or damage thereto resulting from its failure to do so, 
       other than loss or damage caused by fire or by ordinary wear and 
       tear.  

2.     Unless otherwise provided elsewhere in the <em>Contract</em>, no insurance 
       shall be carried by the Contractor on any property owned by Her 
       Majesty provided that if the <em>Contract</em> is for a stipulated price, 
       this subsection 2 shall not prevent the Contractor from carrying 
       insurance upon property the title to which becomes vested in Her 
       Majesty by virtue of section 19 of these General Conditions.


<strong>CCC50  12     (06/91)       Time of the Essence; Extensions</strong>

Time shall be deemed to be of the essence of the <em>Contract</em>; provided that 
the time for completing any of the Work which has been or is likely to be 
delayed by reason of force majeure or other cause beyond the reasonable 
control of the Contractor shall be extended by a period equal to the length 
of the delay so caused, provided that prompt notice in writing of the 
occurrence causing or likely to cause such delay is given to the 
Corporation.


<strong>CCC50  13     (06/91)       Accounts</strong>

The Contractor shall keep proper and detailed accounts and records of the 
cost of the Work and invoices, receipts and vouchers relating thereto. If 
any part of the Work is performed by an <em>Allied Firm</em> in Canada, the 
Contractor shall also cause such <em>Allied Firm</em> to keep similar accounts, 
records, invoices, receipts and vouchers with respect to the cost of the 
work performed by such <em>Allied Firm</em>.  All such accounts, records, invoices, 
receipts and vouchers shall be open to audit and inspection by the 
authorized representatives of the Corporation at any time until the 
expiration of six (6) years from the end of the calendar year in which the <em>
Contract</em> is terminated or completed.  The Corporation's authorized 
representatives may make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom.  The 
Contractor shall afford all facilities for such audits and inspections and 
shall furnish the Corporation and its authorized representatives with all 
such information as it or they may from time to time require with reference 
to such accounts, records, invoices, receipts and vouchers.


<strong>CCC50  14     (06/91)       Secrecy and Protection of Work</strong>

1.     The <em>Contract</em> and the Specifications and all information issued, used 
       or disclosed in connection with the Work are confidential.  The 
       Contractor shall not use the same for any purpose other than the <em>
       Contract</em> without the written authority of the Corporation and shall, 
       at all times, take and cause to be taken all measures necessary for 
       the protection of the same and of the Government Issue, if any, 
       against espionage, sabotage and fire.

2.     The <em>Contract</em> and the Specifications and information aforesaid may be 
       classified as to the degree of precaution necessary for their 
       safeguarding.  If so classified, 

       (a)    the measures to be taken by the Contractor for their 
              safeguarding shall include those set out in any instructions 
              issued in that regard by or on behalf of the Corporation;

       (b)    if so directed by the Corporation, the Contractor shall 
              dispense with the services in connection with the work of any 
              person employed or engaged thereon; and 

       (c)    the Contractor shall permit the Corporation at all times, 
              through such agency as he may see fit, to take and to 
              maintain on or about the premises of the Contractor where the 
              Work or any part thereof is being carried on, such guards or 
              other protective measures as in the opinion of the 
              Corporation may be advisable.


<strong>CCC50  15     (06/91)       Patent Claims and Royalties</strong>

1.     The Contractor shall indemnify the Corporation against all claims, 
       actions, suits and proceedings for the infringement or alleged 
       infringement of any patent based upon the use of any invention 
       protected by such patent in carrying out the <em>Contract</em>, and for 
       royalties or other payments which may be payable in connection with 
       such patent.

2.     Upon notification from the Corporation that any such claim, action, 
       suit or proceeding has been made or commenced, the Contractor shall, 
       unless otherwise instructed by the Corporation, conduct at its own 
       expense all negotiations for the settlement of the same.

              from time to time by the Corporation or by the Inspector are 
              prepared, signed and submitted in accordance with the terms 
              of the <em>Contract</em> or as instructed from time to time by the 
              Corporation; and

       (b)    the Contractor establishes to the satisfaction of the 
              Corporation (if so required) that all materials, parts, work 
              in process and/or Finished Work in respect of which payment 
              is being made are free and clear from all claims, liens, 
              attachments, charges or encumbrances.


<strong>CCC50  18     (06/91)       Indemnity Against Claims</strong>

1.     The Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Her Majesty and the 
       Corporation from and against any and all claims, damages, loss, 
       costs and expenses which they or either of them may at any time 
       incur or suffer as a result of or arising out of

       (a)    any injury to persons (including injuries resulting in death) 
              or loss of or damage to property which may be or be alleged 
              to be caused by or suffered as a result of the carrying out 
              of the Work or any part thereof; and/or

       (b)    any liens, attachments, charges or other encumbrances or 
              claims upon or in respect of any materials, parts, work in 
              process and/or Finished Work delivered, to, or in respect of 
              which any payment has been made by Her Majesty or the 
              Corporation.


<strong>CCC50  19     (06/91)       Title on Progress Payments, Etc.</strong>

materials, parts and/or work in process acquired by the Contractor for the 
purposes of the Work, either by way of progress payments or accountable 
advances or otherwise, title in and to such materials, parts and/or work in 
process shall vest and remain in Her Majesty both before and after 
completion of the Work, unless already so vested under any other provision 
of the <em>Contract</em>, but the Contractor shall nevertheless remain responsible 
therefor until delivery of the Finished Work.


<strong>CCC50  20     (06/91)       Further Assurance</strong>

Wherever it is herein provided that title to any parts, materials, work in 
process and/or Finished Work becomes vested in Her Majesty, the Contractor 
shall execute such conveyances thereof and/or other instruments of further 
assurance as the Corporation may request.


<strong>CCC50  21     (06/91)       Suspension of Work and Changes in 
                     Specifications</strong>

The Corporation may at any time and from time to time order a suspension of 
the Work, in whole or in part and/or make  modifications of, changes in and
/or additions to the Specifications. All directions given by the 
Corporation with respect to the foregoing shall be complied with by the 
Contractor. If any such suspension, modification, change or addition shall 
result in an increase or decrease in the cost of the Work, the <em>Contract 
Price</em> shall be adjusted accordingly, provided that the Contractor shall, in 
no event, be entitled to compensation for any loss of anticipated profits 
(except that in the event of any change which results in a substantial part 
of the Work theretofore performed by the Contractor having to be discarded, 
the Contractor shall be entitled to payment of an amount representing a 
fair and reasonable profit in respect of such discarded Work) and provided 
further that, unless the <em>Contract</em> is on a cost-plus basis, minor increases 
or decreases in cost shall be disregarded.


<strong>CCC50  22     (06/91)       Default by Contractor</strong>

1.     If the Contractor is in default for a period of fifteen (15) days in 
       carrying out the terms of the <em>Contract</em> as a result of events or 
       occurrences for which it is responsible or which are within its 
       control, or if the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or has 
       a receiving order made against it, or makes an assignment for the 
       benefit of creditors, or if an order is made or resolution passed 
       for the winding up of the Contractor, or if the Contractor takes the 
       benefit of any statute for the time being in force relating to 
       bankrupt or insolvent debtors, the Corporation may at its option, 
       upon giving notice in writing to the Contractor,

              whole or in part. 

2.     Upon the giving of such notice, the Contractor shall have no claim 
       for any further payment, save as hereinafter in section 22 provided, 
       but shall remain liable for all loss and damage which may be 
       suffered by Her Majesty by reason of the default or occurrence upon 
       which such notice was based.

3.     If the Work is taken over by the Corporation,

       (a)    all plant, equipment, materials, articles and rights 
              available to the Contractor for the purposes of the Work may 
              be utilized by the Corporation or its authorized 
              representatives as fully as they might have been used and 
              exercised by the Contractor; and

       (b)    unless the <em>Contract</em> is a cost-plus <em>Contract</em>, upon completion 
              of the Work, or such part of it as the Corporation shall see 
              fit to complete, the Contractor shall be entitled to credit, 
              on the basis of the <em>Contract Price</em>, for such of the Work as 
              shall have been so completed by the Corporation and the 
              amount for which the Contractor is so entitled to credit 
              shall be applied against the cost to Her Majesty of 
              completing the Work so completed and the loss or damage for 
              which the Contractor is liable as above provided, and any 
              excess or deficiency shall be paid by Her Majesty to the 
              Contractor or by the Contractor to Her Majesty, as the case 
              may be.

by letter or by telegram, postage prepaid or with charges prepaid, as the 
case may be, addressed to the Contractor at its address as given in the <em>
Agreement</em> or, if no address is so given, at its address as shown by the

such letter or telegram should have reached its destination.


<strong>CCC50  27     (16/02/98)    Arbitration</strong>

In the event of any dispute between the parties with respect to anything 
arising out of the <em>Contract</em> (save in respect of any matter as to which the 
decision of the Corporation or of the Inspector or other person is final or 
any matter with regard to which any other manner of settlement is herein 
expressly provided), the matter in dispute shall be referred for decision 
to a single arbitrator or, if the parties cannot agree upon a single 
arbitrator, to two arbitrators, one to be selected by the Corporation and 
the other by the Contractor.  In case the two arbitrators so selected 
cannot agree, they shall select a third and the decision of any two of the 
three shall be binding.  In case the two arbitrators so selected cannot 
agree upon the selection of the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator 
shall be appointed by the Federal Court upon a reference being made to such 
Court.  A party who has not appointed an arbitrator after the other party 
has appointed one shall do so within five (5) days after being notified in 
writing by such other party to do so, and in default of appointment such 
other party's arbitrator may act as sole arbitrator whose decision shall be 
binding.  If the arbitrator of either party shall fail to proceed with the 
consideration of the matters in dispute within five (5) days after being 
required in writing by the other party's arbitrator to do so, such other 
party's arbitrator, if a third arbitrator has not been appointed, shall be 
at liberty to act as sole arbitrator whose decision shall be binding, or 
the other two arbitrators, if a third has been appointed, may forthwith 
appoint an arbitrator in lieu of the one who has failed to proceed, and the 
decision of two of such three arbitrators shall be binding.  The costs of 
the arbitration shall be in the discretion of the arbitrators; provided, 
however, that no party shall be obliged to pay more than its own costs and 
the costs of the third arbitrator.

 
<strong>CCC50  28     (16/02/98)    Termination</strong>

1.     Notwithstanding anything in the <em>Contract</em> contained, the Corporation 
       may, by giving notice to the Contractor (hereinafter sometimes 
       referred to as a "termination notice"), terminate the <em>Contract</em> (save 
       and except the provisions of this section and of section 13 of these 
       General Conditions) as regards all or any part or parts of the Work 
       not theretofore completed.  Upon a termination notice being given, 
       the Contractor shall cease Work (including the manufacturing and/or 
       procuring of materials for the fulfilment of the <em>Contract</em>) in 
       accordance with and to the extent specified in such notice.  The 
       Corporation may, at any time or from time to time, give one or more 
       additional termination notices with respect to any or all parts of 
       the Work not terminated by any previous termination notice.

2.     In the event of a termination notice being given under the 
       provisions of this section, and subject as hereinafter provided,

       (a)    all Finished Work, whether completed before the giving of 
              such notice or completed thereafter pursuant to such notice, 
              shall be paid for (subject to acceptance in accordance with 
              the provisions of the <em>Contract</em>) on the basis of the <em>Contract 
              Price</em>;

       (b)    in respect of Work not completed before the giving of such 
              notice, and not completed thereafter pursuant to such notice, 
              the Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed the actual 
              cost to the Contractor of such uncompleted Work, and to 
              receive, in addition, an amount representing a fair and 
              reasonable profit in respect of Work done thereon.  Cost 
              shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the <em>
              Contract</em> Cost Principles, DSS-MAS 1031-2, subject to any 
              modifications thereof which the Corporation may consider to 
              be appropriate in the circumstances;

       (c)    subject as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection 2, 
              the Contractor shall be entitled to be reimbursed the amount 
              of any capital expenditures specifically authorized by the <em>
              Contract</em> or approved by the Corporation for the purposes of 
              the <em>Contract</em> (and actually made or incurred) to the extent 
              that the same (less any depreciation in respect thereof 
              already taken into account in determining cost) were 
              reasonably and properly incurred by the Contractor in respect 
              of and are properly apportionable to the performance of the <em>
              Contract</em> and not included in the amounts paid or payable to 
              the Contractor in respect of Finished Work;

       (d)    if the <em>Contract</em> is exclusively a <em>Contract</em> for the making of 
              capital expenditures in respect of additional equipment and/
              or plant additions, the foregoing paragraphs (a) to (c) 
              inclusive of this subsection 2 shall not apply, but Her 
              Majesty shall pay or reimburse the Contractor for the 
              reasonable and proper cost to the Contractor (not previously 
              paid by Her Majesty) of 

              (1)    all additional equipment which prior to the giving of 
                     the termination notice shall have been purchased, 
                     acquired or manufactured by the Contractor, or 
                     contracted for and for which the Contractor is 
                     obligated to make payments; and 

              (2)    all additional equipment in process of manufacture by 
                     the Contractor as at the date of the giving of such 
                     notice and all Work in connection with the 
                     construction of the plant addition up to the said date, 
                     including the cost of materials and parts contracted 
                     for by the Contractor for the purposes of such 
                     manufacture or construction and for which the 
                     Contractor is obligated to make payment.

3.     Provided always that no reimbursement shall be made in respect of 
       Work which has been or may be rejected after inspection as not 
       complying with the requirements of the <em>Contract</em>.

4.     The Contractor shall not be entitled to be reimbursed any amount 
       which taken together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to 
       the Contractor under the <em>Contract</em>, shall exceed the <em>Contract Price</em> 
       applicable to the Work or the particular part thereof. 
 
5.     Notwithstanding the provisions of any of the foregoing subsections 1 
       to 4 inclusive, the amounts which the Contractor shall be entitled 
       to be reimbursed in the event of the giving of a termination notice 
       under this section 28 shall include, subject as hereinafter provided, 
       the costs of the Contractor of an incidental to the cancellation of 
       obligations incurred by the Contractor pursuant to the termination 
       notice, the cost of preparing the necessary accounts and statements 
       with respect to Work performed to the effective date of such 
       termination and/or commitments made by the Contractor with respect 
       to the terminated portions of the Work, wages which the Contractor 
       is obligated under any laws and regulations for the time being in 
       force, to pay to employees whose services are no longer required by 
       reason of such termination, the costs of and incidental to the 
       taking of an inventory of materials, components, work in process and 
       Finished Work on hand at the effective date of the termination and 
       other costs and expenses of and incidental to the termination, in 
       whole or in part, of operations under the <em>Contract</em>; provided always 
       that payment and reimbursement under the provisions of this 
       subsection shall be made only to the extent that it is established 
       to the satisfaction of the Corporation that the costs and expenses 
       aforesaid were actually incurred by the Contractor and that the same 
       are reasonable and are properly attributable to the termination of 
       the Work or the part thereof so terminated.

6.     In case of disagreement as to the amount which the Contractor is 
       entitled to be reimbursed, the matter shall be referred to the 
       Federal Court.

7.     As far as practicable, the Contractor shall place purchase orders 
       and subcontracts on terms that will enable the Contractor to 
       terminate the same upon conditions and terms similar in effect to 
       those provided in this section, and generally the Contractor shall 
       co-operate with the Corporation and do everything reasonably within 
       its power at all times to minimize and reduce the amount of Her 
       Majesty's obligations in the event of termination hereunder.

8.     Title to all materials, parts, plant, equipment and/or work in 
       process in respect of which reimbursement is made to the Contractor 
       as herein provided shall, upon such reimbursement being made, pass 
       to and vest in Her Majesty unless already so vested under any other 
       provision of the <em>Contract</em> and such materials, parts, plant, 
       equipment and/or work in process shall be delivered to the order of 
       the Corporation, but the materials thus taken over will in no case 
       be in excess of what would have been required for performing the <em>
       Contract</em> in full if no termination notice had been given. 

9.     If the Corporation is satisfied that by reason of any action taken 
       under the provisions of this section exceptional hardship has 
       resulted to the Contractor, then the Corporation may, in its 
       absolute discretion, grant such allowance (not to include in any 
       case, however, an allowance or compensation for loss of profit) to 
       the Contractor as, in the opinion of the Corporation, is warranted 
       by the circumstances. 

10.    The Contractor shall have no claim for damages, compensation, loss 
       of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of or directly or 
       indirectly arising out of any action taken or notice given by the 
       Corporation under or pursuant to the provisions of this section 
       except to the extent in this section expressly provided.


<strong>CCC50  29     (06/91)       Foreign Exchange</strong>

Unless otherwise provided in the <em>Contract</em> or agreed to by the Corporation, 
the Contractor shall not be entitled to any increase in the <em>Contract Price</em> 
by reason of foreign exchange fluctuations.


<strong>CCC50  30     (06/06/94)    Certification - Contingency Fees</strong>

1.     The Contractor certifies that it has not directly or indirectly paid 
       or agreed to pay and covenants that it will not directly or 
       indirectly pay a contingency fee for the solicitation, negotiation 
       or obtaining of this <em>Contract</em> to any person other than an employee 
       acting in the normal course of the employee's duties. 
2.     All accounts and records pertaining to payments of fees or other 
       compensation for the solicitation, obtaining or negotiation of the <em>
       Contract</em> shall be subject to the Accounts and Audit provisions of 
       the <em>Contract</em>.

3.     If the Contractor certifies falsely under this section or is in 
       default of the obligations contained therein, the Minister may 
       either terminate this <em>Contract</em> for default in accordance with the 
       termination for default provisions of the <em>Contract</em> or recover from 
       the Contractor by way of reduction to the <em>Contract Price</em> or 
       otherwise the full amount of the contingency fee.

4.     In this section:

       "<strong>contingency fee</strong>" means any payment or other compensation that is 
       contingent upon or is calculated upon the basis of a degree of 
       success in soliciting or obtaining a government <em>Contract</em> or 
       negotiating the whole or any part of its terms;

       "<strong>employee</strong>" means a person with whom the Contractor has an employer/
       employee relationship;

       "<strong>person</strong>" includes an individual or group of individuals, a 
       corporation, a partnership, an organization and an association and, 
       without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes any 
       individual who is required to file a return with the registrar 
       pursuant to section 5 of the <em>Lobbyist Registration Act</em> R.S. 1985 c.44 
       (4th Supplement) as the same may be amended from time to time.
