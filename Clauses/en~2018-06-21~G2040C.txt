<br/>A copy of the letter must be sent to the Contracting Authority. Canada reserves the right to co-defend any action brought against Canada. All expenses incurred by Canada to co-defend such actions will be at Canada's expense. If Canada decides to co-defend any action brought against it, and Canada does not agree to a proposed settlement agreed to by the Contractor's insurer and the plaintiff(s) that would result in the settlement or dismissal of the action against Canada, then Canada will be responsible to the Contractor's insurer for any difference between the proposed settlement amount and the amount finally awarded or paid to the plaintiffs (inclusive of costs and interest) on behalf of Canada.
