<pre>Prior to the purchasing of any spares estimated to be necessary for the 
performance of this Contract, a list of such spares shall be submitted to 
the Minister and to the Department of National Defence for review so that 
it may be determined if any existing stocks of spares belonging to Canada 
may be used as government issue in the performance of this Contract. When 
the list has been reviewed, the Minister shall advise the Contractor in 
writing of those spares, if any, which will be government issue under this 
Contract; provided that this clause shall not be construed as approval by 
Canada of the Contractor's estimates of the spares to be required in the 
performance of the Work; and provided further that this clause shall not be 
deemed to alter or modify any other provision of this Contract or relieve 
the Contractor from any responsibility in carrying out the Contract or 
impose any obligation on Canada.

The Contractor shall keep all such spares purchased or acquired by it, 
   physically segregated from the Contractor-furnished material and shall 
   furnish the Minister with an accounting of its acquisition, storage, 
   handling and use of such spares as the Minister may require.  The 
   Contractor shall permit the authorized representatives of the Minister 
   and of the Department of National Defence to observe the Contractor's 
   provisioning methods in respect of such spares and to inspect such 
   spares, the inventories, the accounting, storage, handling, care, and 
   the use of such spares.
