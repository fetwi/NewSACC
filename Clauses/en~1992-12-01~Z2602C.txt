<pre>If any lien under section 427 of the Bank Act exists in respect of any 
materials, parts, work in process or finished work for which the Contractor 
claims or intends to claim payment, the Contractor hereby agrees to inform 
CCC without delay and the Contractor further agrees, unless otherwise 
instructed by Canadian Commercial Corporation, either:

       (a) to cause the bank to remove such lien forthwith and to furnish 
       CCC with written confirmation thereof from the bank; or

       (b) to furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith to CCC an 
       undertaking from the bank to Canadian Commercial Corporation that 
       the bank will not make any claim under section 427 of the Bank Act 
       upon materials, parts, work in process or finished work in respect 
       of which payment is made to the Contractor under this Contract.

Failure by the Contractor to inform CCC of any such lien or failure by the 
   Contractor to implement paragraphs (a) or (b) above shall constitute 
   default under the clause entitled "Default by Contractor" in the General 
   Conditions of the Contract, entitling Canadian Commercial Corporation to 
   terminate the Contract.
