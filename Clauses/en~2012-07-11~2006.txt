<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments
and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing
offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period.
Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to
make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact
quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a
particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer
in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The process normally starts with a Request for Standing Offers
(RFSO) that suppliers may obtain through the Government Electronic
Tendering Service (GETS). A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> is an invitation to suppliers to
provide <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with a standing offer. The quantity of goods, level
of services and estimated expenditure specified in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> are
only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
does not commit <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to authorize the utilization of a standing
offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A
standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> of a
Standing Offer and Call-up Authority to successful suppliers and to
departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not
constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods,
services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or
several call-ups against a standing offer.</p>
<h2>01 Code of Conduct and Certifications - Offer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">
Offerors must comply with the <cite><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">Code of Conduct for Procurement</a></cite>.  In addition to the <cite><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external">Code of Conduct for Procurement</a></cite>, offerors must a) respond to Requests for Standing Offers (RFSO) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, b) accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>, Standing Offers and resulting contracts, c) submit offers and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.
</li>
<li value="2">
Offerors further understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be issued a Standing Offer and awarded a contract.  Canada will declare non-responsive any offer in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada.  If it is determined, after issuance of a Standing Offer, that the Offeror made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to set aside the Standing Offer and to terminate for default any resulting contracts.  The Offeror will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested.  The Offeror and any of the Offeror’s parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any standing offer arising from this <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
 and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer.  Canada may verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.
</li>
<li value="3">
For the purpose of this section, business concerns, organizations and individuals are Offeror’s affiliates if:
		
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">	a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in this section which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.
</li>
<li value="4">Offerors must submit the following as part of their offer:

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Offeror;
</li>
<li value="2">	a properly completed and signed Consent Form, for each individual named in the aforementioned list.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">
The Offeror must diligently maintain the list up-to-date by informing Canada in writing of any change occuring during the validity period of the offer, and must also provide Canada with the corresponding Consent Forms.  The Offeror will also be required to diligently maintain the list and to provide Consent Forms during the period of any standing offer and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer.</li>
<li value="6">
By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies to be aware, and that its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates are aware, that Canada may verify the information provided by the Offeror, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.
</li>
<li value="7">
By submitting an offer, the Offeror certifies that neither the Offeror nor any of the Offeror’s parent companies, subsidiaries or affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Standing Offer and any call-ups made against the Standing Offer if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-12.4/" rel="external">Lobbying Act</a></cite>.</li>
<li value="8">

Works and Government Services Act</a></cite> (<abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr>
16), the
instructions, clauses and conditions identified in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
,
standing offer and resulting contract(s) by number, date and title
are incorporated by reference into and form part of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
,
standing offer and resulting contract(s) as though expressly set
out in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
, the standing offer and the resulting
contract(s).</p>
<h2>04 Definition of Offeror</h2>
<p><dfn>"Offeror"</dfn> means the person or entity (or, in the case
of a joint venture, the persons or entities) submitting an offer to
provide goods, services or both under a call-up resulting from a
standing offer. It does not include the parent, subsidiaries or
other affiliates of the Offeror, or its subcontractors.</p>
<h2>05 Submission of Offers</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada requires that each offer, at closing date and
time or upon request from the Standing Offer Authority, be signed
by the Offeror or by an authorized representative of the Offeror.
If an offer is submitted by a joint venture, it must be in
accordance with section 17.</li>
<li value="2">It is the Offeror's responsibility to:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">obtain clarification of the requirements contained in
the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
, if necessary, before submitting an offer;</li>
<li value="2">prepare its offer in accordance with the instructions
contained in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>;</li>
<li value="3">submit by closing date and time complete offer;</li>
<li value="4">send its offer only to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Bid Receiving Unit
specified on page 1 of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> or to the address specified in the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>. The facsimile number and related instructions for offers
transmitted by facsimile are provided in section 08;</li>
<li value="5">ensure that the Offeror's name, return address, <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
number, and <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> closing date and time are clearly visible on the
envelope or the parcel(s) containing the offer; and,</li>
<li value="6">provide a comprehensible and sufficiently detailed
offer, including all requested pricing details, that will permit a
complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out in the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>.</li>
</ol>

<li value="3">If Canada has provided offerors with multiple formats
of a document (for example, a document may be downloaded through
the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) but may also be
made available on <abbr title="Compact Disc Read-only Memory">CD-ROM</abbr> through <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>), the format downloaded
through <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr> will take precedence. If Canada posts an amendment to
the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> revising any documents provided to offerors in multiple
formats, Canada will not necessarily update all formats to reflect
these revisions. It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that
revisions made through any <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> amendment issued through <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr> are
taken into account in the alternate formats it uses of <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>

to seek an extension of the offer validity period from all
responsive offerors in writing, within a minimum of three (3) days
before the end of the offer validity period. If the extension is
accepted by all responsive offerors, Canada will continue with the
evaluation of the offers. If the extension is not accepted by all
responsive offerors, Canada will, at its sole discretion, either
continue with the evaluation of the offers of those who have
accepted the extension or cancel the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>.</li>
<li value="5">Offers and supporting information may be submitted in
either English or French.</li>
<li value="6">Offers received on or before the stipulated <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
closing date and time will become the property of Canada and will

described below.</p>
<h2>07 Delayed Offers</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">An offer delivered to the specified Bid Receiving
Unit after the closing date and time but before the standing offer
issuance date may be considered, provided the offeror can prove the
delay is due solely to a delay in delivery that can be attributed
to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a
foreign country). Purolator <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> is not considered to be part of
<abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> for the purposes of delayed offers. The only pieces of evidence
relating to a delay in the <abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> system that are acceptable to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>

<p>It is the responsibility of the Offeror to allow sufficient time
to obtain customs clearance, where required, before the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>
closing date and time. Delays related to the obtaining of customs
clearance cannot be construed as "undue delay in the mail" and will
not be accepted as a delayed offer under section 07.</p>
<h2>10 Legal Capacity</h2>
<p>The Offeror must have the legal capacity to contract. If the
Offeror is a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate
body, the Offeror must provide, if requested by the Standing Offer
Authority, a statement and any requested supporting documentation

<li value="1">Canada may reject an offer where any of the following
circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Offeror is subject to a Vendor Performance
Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which
renders the Offeror ineligible to submit an offer for the
requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the
offer, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under
the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which would render that employee or
subcontractor ineligible to submit an offer for the requirement, or
the portion of the requirement the employee or subcontractor is to
perform;</li>
<li value="3">the Offeror is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>

<li value="5">evidence satisfactory to Canada that based on past conduct or behavior, the Offeror, a subcontractor or a person who is to perform the Work is unsuitable or has conducted himself/herself improperly;</li>
<li value="6">with respect to current or prior transactions with
the Government of Canada:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of
suspension or termination for default with respect to a contract
with the Offeror, any of its employees or any subcontractor
included as part of the offer;</li>
<li value="2">Canada determines that the Offeror's performance on other
contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as well as the
extent to which the Offeror performed the Work in accordance with
contractual clauses and conditions, is sufficiently poor to
jeopardize the successful completion of the requirement being bid
on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject an offer pursuant to a
provision of subsection 1. (f), the Standing Offer Authority will
so inform the Offeror and provide the Offeror ten (10) days within
which to make representations, before making a final decision on
the offer rejection.</li>
<li value="3">Canada reserves the right to apply additional scrutiny, in particular, when multiple offers are received in response to a request for standing offers from a single offeror or a joint venture. Canada reserves the right to:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">reject any or all of the offers submitted by a single offeror or joint venture if their inclusion in the evaluation has the effect of prejudicing the integrity and fairness of the process, or;</li>
<li value="2">reject any or all of the offers submitted by a single offeror or joint venture if their inclusion in the procurement process would distort the solicitation evaluation, and would cause a result that would not reasonably have been expected under prevailing market conditions and/or would not provide good value to Canada.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>13 Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> process,
enquiries and other communications regarding the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> must be
directed only to the Standing Offer Authority identified in the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the
offer being declared non-responsive.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to
offerors, significant enquiries received and the replies to such
enquiries will be provided simultaneously to offerors to which the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> has been sent, without revealing the sources of the
enquiries.</p>
<h2>14 Price Justification</h2>
<p>In the event that the Offeror's offer is the sole responsive

the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>;</li>
<li value="2">contact any or all references supplied by offerors to
verify and validate any information submitted by them;</li>
<li value="3">request, before issuance of any standing offer,
specific information with respect to offerors' legal status;</li>
<li value="4">conduct a survey of offerors' facilities and/or

<li value="5">correct any error in the extended pricing of offers
by using unit pricing and any error in quantities in offers to
reflect the quantities stated in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>; in the case of error in

<li value="6">verify any information provided by offerors through
independent research, use of any government resources or by

<h2>17 Joint Venture</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A joint venture is an association of two or more
parties who combine their money, property, knowledge, expertise or
other resources in a single joint business enterprise, sometimes

joint venture;</li>

i.e. the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf,
if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>

<li value="2">If the information is not clearly provided in the
offer, the Offeror must provide the information on request from the
Standing Offer Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The offer and any resulting standing offer must be
signed by all the members of the joint venture unless one member
has been appointed to act on behalf of all members of the joint
venture. The Standing Offer Authority may, at any time, require
each member of the joint venture to confirm that the representative

<h2>18 Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, offerors are advised that Canada may reject an offer in
the following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Offeror, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> or in any situation of
conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Offeror, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> that was not available to other
offerors and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to
give the Offeror an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by an offeror who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
<abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This offeror remains however subject to the
criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject an offer under this
section, the Standing Offer Authority will inform the Offeror and
provide the Offeror an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Offerors who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Standing Offer Authority
before the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> closing. By submitting an offer, the Offeror
represents that it does not consider itself to be in conflict of
interest nor to have an unfair advantage. The Offeror acknowledges
that it is within Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a
conflict of interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict
of interest or unfair advantage exists.</li>
</ol>
<h2>19 Entire Requirement</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> contains all the requirements relating to the request
for offers. Any other information or documentation provided to or
obtained by an offeror from any source are not relevant. Offerors
should not assume that practices used under previous contracts will
continue, unless they are described in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr>. Offerors should
also not assume that their existing capabilities meet the
requirements of the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> simply because they have met previous
requirements.</p>
