<pre>1.     This section applies despite any other provision of the Contract and 
       replaces the section of the general conditions entitled "Liability".  
       Any reference in this section to damages caused by the Contractor 
       also includes damages caused by its employees, as well as its 
       subcontractors, agents, and representatives, and any of their 
       employees.  This section applies regardless of whether the claim is 
       based in contract, tort, or another cause of action. The Contractor 
       is not liable to Canada with respect to the performance of or 
       failure to perform the Contract, except as described in this section 
       and in any section of the Contract pre-establishing any liquidated 
       damages. The Contractor is only liable for indirect, special or 
       consequential damages to the extent described in this section, even 
       if it has been made aware of the potential for those damages.

2.     First Party Liability:

       (a)    The Contractor is fully liable for all damages to Canada, 
              including indirect, special or consequential damages, caused 
              by the Contractor's performance or failure to perform the 
              Contract that relate to:

              (i)    any infringement of intellectual property rights to 
                     the extent the Contractor breaches the section of the 
                     general conditions entitled "Intellectual Property 
                     Infringement and Royalties";

              (ii)   physical injury, including death.

       (b)    The Contractor is liable for all direct damages caused by the 
              Contractor's performance or failure to perform the Contract 
              affecting real or tangible personal property owned, possessed, 
              or occupied by Canada. 

       (c)    Each of the Parties is liable for all direct damages 
              resulting from its breach of confidentiality under the 
              Contract. Each of the Parties is also liable for all indirect, 
              special or consequential damages in respect of its 
              unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's trade secrets 
              (or trade secrets of a third party provided by one Party to 
              another under the Contract) relating to information 
              technology. 

       (d)    The Contractor is liable for all direct damages relating to 
              any encumbrance or claim relating to any portion of the Work 
              for which Canada has made any payment. This does not apply to 
              encumbrances or claims relating to intellectual property 
              rights, which are addressed under (a) above.

       (e)    The Contractor is also liable for any other direct damages to 
              Canada caused by the Contractor's performance or failure to 
              perform the Contract that relate to:

              (i)    any breach of the warranty obligations under the 
                     Contract, up to the total amount paid by Canada 
                     (including any applicable taxes) for the goods and 
                     services affected by the breach of warranty; and

              (ii)   any other direct damages, including all identifiable 
                     direct costs to Canada associated with re-procuring 
                     the Work from another party if the Contract is 
                     terminated by Canada either in whole or in part for 
                     default, up to an aggregate maximum for this 
                     subparagraph (ii) of the greater of _____ times the 
                     total estimated cost (meaning the dollar amount shown 
                     on the first page of the Contract in the block titled 
                     "Total Estimated Cost" or shown on each call-up, 
                     purchase order or other document used to order goods 
                     or services under this instrument), or $________.<strong> </strong>(<span class="wsInlineRemark"><strong>
                     Insert the amount from the appropriate commodity 
                     grouping</strong></span>.)

              In any case, the total liability of the Contractor under 
              paragraph (e) will not exceed the total estimated cost (as 
              defined above) for the Contract or $________,<strong> </strong>(<span class="wsInlineRemark"><strong>insert the 
              dollar amount entered in subparagraph (ii</strong></span><span class="wsInlineRemark">)</span>), whichever is 
              more.

       (f)    If Canada's records or data are harmed as a result of the 
              Contractor's negligence or willful act, the Contractor's only 
              liability is, at the Contractor's own expense, to restore 
              Canada's records and data using the most recent back-up kept 
              by Canada. Canada is responsible for maintaining an adequate 
              back-up of its records and data.

3.     Third Party Claims:

       (a)    Regardless of whether a third party makes its claim against 
              Canada or the Contractor, each Party agrees that it is liable 
              for any damages that it causes to any third party in 
              connection with the Contract as set out in a settlement 
              agreement or as finally determined by a court of competent 
              jurisdiction, where the court determines that the Parties are 
              jointly and severally liable or that one Party is solely and 
              directly liable to the third party. The amount of the 
              liability will be the amount set out in the settlement 
              agreement or determined by the court to have been the Party's 
              portion of the damages to the third party. No settlement 
              agreement is binding on a Party unless its authorized 
              representative has approved the agreement in writing.

       (b)    If Canada is required, as a result of joint and several 
              liability, to pay a third party in respect of damages caused 
              by the Contractor, the Contractor must reimburse Canada by 
              the amount finally determined by a court of competent 
              jurisdiction to be the Contractor's portion of the damages to 
              the third party. However, despite paragraph (a), with respect 
              to special, indirect, and consequential damages of third 
              parties covered by this section, the Contractor is only 
              liable for reimbursing Canada for the Contractor's portion of 
              those damages that Canada is required by a court to pay to a 
              third party as a result of joint and several liability that 
              relate to the infringement of a third party's intellectual 
              property rights; physical injury of a third party, including 
              death; damages affecting a third party's real or tangible 
              personal property; liens or encumbrances on any portion of 
              the Work; or breach of confidentiality. 

       (c)    The Parties are only liable to one another for damages to 
              third parties to the extent described in this paragraph 3.
