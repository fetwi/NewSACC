(unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Authority or the
Inspector and subject to such conditions as the Contracting
Authority or the Inspector may impose), at its own expense, repair,
restore and/or replace the Vessel and/or the Work so lost or
damaged. Canada will not be in any manner responsible or liable for

will remit any revenues and income (provided that Canada must in no
event be obligated to invest moneys as interest or otherwise) to
the Contractor. In the case of interest coupons, or dividend
