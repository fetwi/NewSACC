<pre>Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the price herein includes no 
amount for any federal excise tax, state or local sales or use tax, or any 
other tax of a similar nature, or any Canadian tax whatsoever.  Such price, 
however, includes all other taxes. If the Work is normally subject to 
federal excise tax, Canada will, upon request, furnish the Contractor with 
a certificate of exemption from such federal excise tax in the form 
prescribed by the federal regulations.  Canada undertakes to supply the 
Contractor with such evidence of export as may, from time to time, be 
properly requested by the tax authorities.  If, as a result of Canada's 
failure to do so, the Contractor is compelled to pay such federal excise 
tax, Canada shall reimburse the Contractor therefor, provided, however, 
that the Contractor will thereafter take such steps as Canada may require 
in an effort to recover such payment, and shall refund to Canada any amount 
so recovered.
