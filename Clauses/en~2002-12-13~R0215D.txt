<pre>1.     Persons and companies in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada, 
       are bound by economic sanctions imposed by Canada.  As a result, the 
       Government of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services 
       that originate, either directly or indirectly, from the countries or 
       persons subject to economic sanctions.  

       Details on existing sanctions can be found at:

2.     It is a condition of the Contract that the Contractor not supply to 
       the Government of Canada any goods or services which are subject to 
       economic sanctions.

3.     By law, the Contractor must comply with changes to the regulations 
       imposed during the life of the Contract.  During the performance of 
       the Contract should the imposition of sanctions against a country or 
       person or the addition of a good or service to the list of 
       sanctioned goods or services cause an impossibility of performance 
       for the Contractor, the Contractor may request that the Contract be 
       terminated in accordance with GC41 of the General Conditions.
