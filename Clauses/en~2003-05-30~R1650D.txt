<strong>GC 9.2 (30/05/03)    Insurance Requirements</strong>

1.     General

       (a)    The Consultant, at the Consultant's expense, shall obtain and 
              maintain, or shall cause to be obtained and maintained, 
              insurance coverage in respect of the Services, and in 
              accordance with the requirements of this General Condition.

       (b)    If requested in writing by the Contracting Authority, within 
              thirty (30) days after acceptance of the Consultant's 
              proposal by Canada, the Consultant shall deposit with the 
              Contracting Authority an Insurer's Certificate of Insurance 
              in the form included in this clause and, if requested by the 
              Contracting Authority, the originals or certified true copies 
              of all contracts of insurance maintained by or on behalf of 
              the Consultant and the Consultant's Sub-Consultants as might 
              be applicable pursuant to the insurance coverage requirements 
              contained in the proposal documents.  Thereafter, during and 
              after the performance of the Services, the Consultant shall 
              provide the Contracting Authority, on request, with 
              verification satisfactory to the Contracting Authority that 
              the required insurance coverage is in place.

       (c)    If requested in writing by the Contracting Authority the 
              Consultant shall provide annually to the Contracting 
              Authority an Insurer's Certificate of Insurance until the 
              services provided by the Consultant under the contract are 
              completed.

       (d)    This insurance coverage is not intended to cover all of the 
              Consultant's indemnification obligations.  Any additional 
              insurance coverage the Consultant may deem necessary to 
              fulfill the Consultant's obligations shall be at the 
              Consultant's discretion and expense.

       (e)    The payment of monies up to any deductible amount made in 
              satisfaction of any claim shall be at the Consultant's 
              expense.

       (f)    Forthwith upon receipt of the Insurer's certification, the 
              Consultant shall deposit it with the Contracting Authority.

2.     Commercial General Liability

       (a)    Commercial General Liability insurance coverage shall be 
              effected by the Consultant at the Consultant's expense, and 
              maintained in force throughout the performance of the 
              Services.  The policy shall be in an amount usual for the 
              nature and scope of the Services but, unless specified 
              elsewhere in the proposal documents, shall have a limit of 
              liability of not less than $1,000,000 for any one occurrence 
              or series of occurrences arising out of one cause.  Legal or 
              defence costs incurred in respect of a claim or claims shall 
              not operate to decrease the limit of liability.

       (b)    The policy shall insure Canada, the Consultant, and the 
              Consultant's Sub-Consultants for the performance of the 
              Services, and shall include but not be limited to the 
              following coverage/provisions:

              (i)    "Additional Named Insured:  Canada as represented by 
                     the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
                     is named as an Additional Named Insured under any 
                     liability insurance policies for Canada's respective 
                     rights and interests under the contract for the 
                     performance of the Services."

              (ii)   "Cross Liability:  Any act or omission by one or 
                     another of the Insured hereunder shall not prejudice 
                     the rights or interests of any other Insured.  This 
                     policy, subject to its limits of liability, shall 
                     apply to each Insured in the same manner and to the 
                     same extent as if a separate policy had been issued to 
                     each.  The inclusion herein of more than one Insured 
                     shall not operate to increase the limits of the 
                     Insurers' liability."

              (iii)  "Litigation Rights:  It is understood and agreed that 
                     where any suit is instituted for or against Canada 
                     which the Insurer or Insurers would, but for this 
                     clause, have the right to pursue or defend on behalf 
                     of Canada as an Additional Named Insured under this 
                     insurance policy, the Insurer shall promptly contact 
                     the Attorney General of Canada to agree on the legal 
                     strategies by sending a registered letter to:

                     Senior General Counsel
                     Civil Litigation Section
                     Department of Justice
                     East Memorial Building
                     284 Wellington Street, 2nd Floor
                     Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

                     The notification must be followed, within a reasonable 
                     period, by an information copy to the Contracting 
                     Authority. 

                     The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right 
                     to co-defend any action brought against Canada.  
                     However, all expenses incurred by Canada to co-defend 
                     such actions would be at Canada's expense."

              (iv)   "Notice of Cancellation or Amendments of Insurance 
                     Coverage:  The Insurer agrees to give the Contracting 
                     Authority at least thirty (30) days' prior written 
                     notice of any policy cancellation or any changes in 
                     the policy coverage."

3.     Professional Liability

       (a)    The Consultant, at the Consultant's expense, shall effect and 
              continuously maintain Professional Liability insurance 
              coverage from the commencement of performance of the Services 
              for a minimum five (5) years after their completion.  The 
              policy shall be in an amount usual for the nature and scope 
              of the Services but, unless specified elsewhere in the 
              proposal documents, shall have a limit of liability of not 
              less than $250,000 per claim.

       (b)    The following clauses must be incorporated into the 
              conditions of the Consultant's Professional Liability 
              insurance coverage:

              (i)    "Litigation Rights:  It is understood and agreed that 
                     where any suit is instituted for or against Canada 
                     which the Insurer, or Insurers would, but for this 
                     clause, have the right to pursue or defend on behalf 
                     of Canada under this insurance policy, the Insurer 
                     shall promptly contact the Attorney General of Canada 
                     to agree on the legal strategies by sending a 
                     registered letter to:

                     Senior General Counsel,
                     Civil Litigation Section,
                     Department of Justice
                     East Memorial Building
                     284 Wellington Street, 2nd Floor
                     Ottawa, Ontario   K1A 0H8

                     The notification must be followed, within a reasonable 
                     period, by an information copy to the Contracting 
                     Authority.

                     The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right 
                     to co-defend any action brought against Canada.  
                     However, all expenses incurred by Canada to co-defend 
                     such actions would be at Canada's expense."

              (ii)   "Notice of Cancellation of Insurance Coverage:  The 
                     Insurer agrees to give the Contracting Authority at 
                     least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of any 
                     policy cancellation."
