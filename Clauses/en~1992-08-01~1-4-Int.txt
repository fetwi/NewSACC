<pre>Supplemental General Conditions are used in conjunction with one of the 
General Condition sets in Section 3.  Their purpose is to expand upon and 
clarify specific points within the context of an identified subject area.  
For example, Supplemental General Condition DSS-MAS 1028 - Ship 
Construction - Firm Price, expands upon the topic of ship construction.

Prior to the introduction of the SACC Manual, Supplemental General 
Condition sets were attached to each bid solicitation package.  This 
practice has been replaced by incorporation by reference.  The specified 
Supplemental General Conditions specified in standard clause A0000D form 
part of the procurement document.

To improve readability, each condition set includes an index section 
(article) - 00, which details the various subjects covered within the 
condition set.  As well, each section has an effective date.  As conditions 
are updated and modified, only the affected section will receive a new 
effective date, corresponding to the effective date for the whole condition 
set;  thus making changes more readily identifiable by users.

The following list identifies those supplemental general condition sets 
which are currently in use by the Department of Supply and Services, their 
latest revision date and their title.<span class="wsStyleUnderline"></span>
