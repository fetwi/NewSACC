<pre>If the Contractor wishes to make use of certain Canada-owned information 
for purposes of the commercial exploitation or further development of the 
Foreground Information, and where Canada has granted or grants a license to 
the Intellectual Property Rights in the Foreground Information for such 
purposes, then the Contractor may make a written request for a license to 
exercise the required Intellectual Property Rights in such Canada-owned 
information,<strong> </strong>to the minister for whose department or agency the Work is 
being or was carried out.  The Contractor shall give that minister an 
explanation as to why such a license is required.  That minister shall 
respond in writing to any request for such a license within a reasonable 
period of time.  Should the minister for whose department the work is being 
or was carried out agree to grant such a license, it shall be on terms and 
conditions to be negotiated between the Contractor and that minister.  It 
is understood that those terms may include payment of compensation to 
Canada.
