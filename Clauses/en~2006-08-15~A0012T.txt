<pre>To ensure the integrity of the competitive bid process, enquiries and other 
communications regarding the bid solicitation, must be directed only to the 
Contracting Authority identified in the bid solicitation.  Failure to 
comply can, for that reason alone, result in the disqualification of the 
bid.

All enquiries must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Authority no 
later than _____ calendar days prior to the bid closing date of the bid 
solicitation.  Enquiries received after that time may not be answered prior 
to the bid closing date.

To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to bidders, 
   significant enquiries received and the replies to such enquiries will be 
   provided simultaneously to bidders to which the bid solicitation has 
   been sent, without revealing the sources of the enquiries.
