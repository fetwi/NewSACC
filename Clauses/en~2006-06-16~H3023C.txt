<pre>1.     Pursuant to paragraph 221(1)(d) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, 
       c.1 (5th Supp.), payments made by departments and agencies to 
       contractors under applicable services contracts (including contracts 
       involving a mix of goods and services) must be reported on a T1204 
       Government Service Contract Payments slip.

2.     To enable departments and agencies to comply with this requirement, 
       the Contractor must provide the following information with its first 
       invoice:

       (a)    the legal name of the Contractor, i.e. the legal name 
              associated with its business number or Social Insurance 
              Number (SIN), as well as its address and postal code;

       (b)    the status of the Contractor, i.e. an individual, a sole 
              proprietorship, a corporation, or a partnership;

       (c)    the business number of the Contractor if the Contractor is a 
              corporation or a partnership and the SIN if the Contractor is 
              an individual or a sole proprietorship.  In the case of a 
              partnership, if the partnership does not have a business 
              number, the partner who has signed the Contract must provide 
              its SIN;

       (d)    in the case of a joint venture, the business number of all 
              parties to the joint venture who have a business number or 
              their SIN if they do not have a business number.

3.     If the information includes a SIN, the information should be 
   provided in a separate envelope marked "PROTECTED" and attached to the 
   invoice.
