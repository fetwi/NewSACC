<pre><strong>A.     INSTRUCTIONS (APPLICABLE TO BID SOLICITATION)</strong>

<strong>1.     Submission of Proposals</strong>

(1)    This is a request (hereinafter referred to as a bid solicitation) 
       that proposals be developed and submitted to the Minister of Public 
       Works and Government Services setting out the alternative means by 
       which several technical, performance, time and other goals and 
       objectives may be best met, having regard to stated mandatory 
       requirements. Canada will consider entering into contract for the 
       implementation of the most acceptable proposal which will be 
       determined having regard to the evaluation factors set out in this 
       bid solicitation. In addition, the proposal will be measured against 
       the contract terms and conditions set forth in this bid solicitation.

(2)    It is the Bidder's responsibility to:

       (a)    return a signed original of the bid solicitation document, 
              duly completed, IN THE FORMAT REQUESTED;

       (b)    direct its bid ONLY to the bid receiving address specified;

       (c)    ensure that the Bidder's name, the bid solicitation reference 
              number, and bid solicitation closing date and time are 
              clearly visible;

       (d)    provide a comprehensive and sufficiently detailed bid, 
              including all requested pricing details, that will permit a 
              complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out 
              in the bid solicitation.

       <strong>TIMELY RECEIPT AND CORRECT DIRECTION OF BIDS IS THE SOLE 
       RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BIDDER. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND 
       GOVERNMENT SERVICES (DPWGS) WILL NOT ASSUME<strong><strong> OR </strong></strong>HAVE TRANSFERRED TO 
       IT THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES.</strong><strong></strong>

(3)    Bids may be accepted in whole or in part. The lowest or any bid will 
       not necessarily be accepted. In the case of error in the extension 
       of prices, the unit price will govern.

(4)    Bids will remain open for acceptance for a period of not less than 
       sixty (60) days from the closing date of the bid solicitation, 
       unless otherwise indicated by Canada in such bid solicitation.

(5)    While Canada may enter into contract without negotiation, Canada 
       reserves the right to negotiate with bidders on any procurement.

(6)    Bid documents and supporting information may be submitted in either 
       English or French.

<strong>2.     Late Bids</strong>

       It is DPWGS policy to return, unopened, bids received after the 
       stipulated bid solicitation closing date and time, unless they 
       qualify as a delayed bid as described below.

<strong>3.     Delayed Bids</strong>

(1)    A bid received after the closing date and time but before the 
       Contract award date may be considered, provided the delay can be 
       proven to have been due solely to a delay in delivery that can be 
       attributed to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or national 
       equivalent of a foreign country) or to incorrect handling by DPWGS. 
       The only pieces of evidence relating to a delay in the CPC system 
       that are acceptable to DPWGS are: 

       (a)    a CPC cancellation date stamp;
       (b)    a CPC Priority Courier Bill of Lading; and 
       (c)    a CPC Xpresspost Label,

       that clearly indicate that the bid was mailed prior to the bid 
       closing date.

       Example: If the bid closing date was May 15, 1995, then the CPC 
       cancellation date stamp should read no later than May 14, 1995, to 
       be accepted.

(2)    Please request the postal employee to date-stamp your envelope.

(3)    For bids transmitted by facsimile or commercial telegram, only the 
       date and the time of receipt recorded by DPWGS at the number stated 
       below will be accepted as evidence of a delayed bid.

<strong>4.     Postage Meters</strong>

       Postage meter imprints, whether imprinted by the Supplier, the CPC 
       or the postal authority outside Canada, are not acceptable as proof 
       of timely mailing. It should be noted that CPC does not normally 
       apply a cancellation date stamp to metered mail; this is usually 
       done only when postage stamps are used.

<strong>5.     Responses Transmitted by Facsimile or Commercial Telegram</strong>

(1)    If you are in doubt that your bid will be received on time at the 
       specific location designated for the receipt of the bid, you may use 
       a facsimile or a commercial telegram, unless otherwise instructed in 
       the bid solicitation package.

       <strong>NOTE</strong>:  Due to the volume of technical material required for some 
              bids, certain solicitation documents may specify that 
              submissions by facsimile or commercial telegram are not 
              acceptable (e.g. science solicitations).

(2)    Unless otherwise instructed in the bid solicitation, the only 
       acceptable facsimile number for responses to bid solicitations 
       issued by DPWGS headquarters sectors is (819) 997-9776.

(3)    The facsimile number for responses to bid solicitations issued by 
       DPWGS regional offices is identified on the front page of the bid 
       solicitation document.

(4)    Bids submitted by facsimile or commercial telegram will constitute 
       your formal bid and must contain:

       (a)    the bid reference number;
       (b)    the closing date and time;
       (c)    sufficient detail and be comprehensive enough so as to permit 
              complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out 
              in the bid solicitation.

(5)    For responses transmitted by facsimile or commercial telegram, 
       written confirmation is required within 2 working days after bid 
       closing, unless otherwise specified in this solicitation. All 
       documents confirming bids should bear the word "CONFIRMATION".

(6)    Only incorrect handling by DPWGS will excuse the delay of responses 
       transmitted by facsimile or commercial telegram. Misrouting, traffic 
       volume, weather disturbances, or any other causes for the late 
       receipt of such responses are not acceptable.

<strong>6.     Pricing</strong>

       Unless otherwise specified by Canada, all prices quoted shall be net 
       prices in Canadian funds including Canadian customs duties and 
       excise taxes, and are to be FOB, including all delivery charges to 
       destination(s) as indicated. The amount of the Goods and Services 
       Tax shall be shown as a separate item. 

<strong>B.     CONDITIONS (APPLICABLE TO BID SOLICITATION AND RESULTING CONTRACT)</strong>

<strong>1.     Municipal Taxes</strong>

Municipal taxes are not applicable.

<strong>2.     Provincial Taxes</strong>

(1)    Excluding legislated exceptions (see subsection (4) below), federal 
       government departments and agencies are not required to pay any ad 
       valorem sales tax levied by the province in which the taxable goods 
       or services are delivered. This exemption has been provided to 
       federal government departments and agencies under the authority of 
       one of the following:

       (a)    Provincial Sales Tax Exemption Licence Numbers, for the 
              provinces of:

              Newfoundland         32243-0-09
              Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250
              Nova Scotia          U84-00-03172-3
              Ontario                     11708174G
              Manitoba             390-516-0
              British Columbia     005521

       (b)    An Exemption Certification, for Quebec, New Brunswick, 
              Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, and the Northwest 
              Territories, which certifies that the property and/or 
              services ordered/purchased hereby are for the use of, and are 
              being purchased by the federal government with Canada funds, 
              and are therefore not subject to provincial/territorial sales 
              and consumption taxes.

(2)    Currently, in Alberta, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, and the 
       Northwest Territories, provincial sales taxes do not apply to goods 
       or services delivered to the federal government.

(3)    The Contractor is not exempt from paying Provincial Sales Tax under 
       the above Exemption Licence Numbers or Exemption Certification. The 
       Contractor is required to pay Provincial Sales Tax on taxable goods 
       or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (as 
       per appropriate provincial legislation), including material 
       incorporated into real property.

(4)    Exceptions

       The following exceptions are provided as examples and may not 
       represent a complete list of all exceptions under the law:

       (a)    tobacco products subject to tobacco taxes;
       (b)    petroleum products subject to gasoline and motive fuel taxes;
       (c)    vehicle registration fees;
       (d)    amusement/admission (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick);
       (e)    insurance premiums (Quebec);
       (f)    tires/batteries subject to environmental levies (British 
              Columbia and Alberta);
       (g)    transient living accommodation subject to hotel room taxes 
              (Prince Edward Island and British Columbia).

<strong>3.     Proof of Legal Entity</strong>

       In order to establish the legal capacity of the bidders to enter 
       into the Contract, bidders who carry on business in other than their 
       own personal names may be required to provide proof of the legal 
       entity under which they carry on business to the Contracting 
       Authority prior to contract award. Such proof may be in the form of 
       copies of articles of incorporation, registration of a name as a 
       sole proprietor, or of a trade name, or of a partnership, etc.

<strong>4.     Transportation Charges</strong>

       If transportation charges are payable by Canada under the terms of 
       the Contract, shipments are to be made by the most direct and 
       economical means consistent with normal shipping practice, unless 
       otherwise directed (as in the case when transportation costs are 
       part of the unit price). They are to be shown as a separate item on 
       the invoice.

<strong>5.     Valuation</strong>

       The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks 
       precludes payment of any excess valuation and/or transportation 
       charges beyond the specified FOB point (the point at which title of 
       goods passes to the federal government). Goods will be covered to 
       the carrier's maximum liability and value will be declared only when 
       additional costs will not be incurred.

<strong>6.     Inspection and Acceptance</strong>

       The Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by consignee at 
       destination, unless otherwise indicated in the contractual document.

<strong>7.     Standard Clauses, Conditions and Instruction Sets</strong>

       Any standard clause, and any condition or instruction set, used or 
       referenced in a bid solicitation or Contract may be updated from 
       time to time. When this happens, the version used in an 
       already-issued document will remain in effect in that document, 
       unless the updated version is legally incorporated.
