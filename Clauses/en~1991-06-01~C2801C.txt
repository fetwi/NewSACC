<pre>This Contract concerns a Canadian defence requirement and therefore is 
eligible to be assigned a "U.S. Priority Rating" for any materials/services 
imported from the United States which may be required in the performance of 
the Work.  Accordingly, the Contractor shall:

       a)  make an application to the Priorities and Allocations Officer, 
       Department of Supply and Services, Hull, Quebec K1A 0S5, in the 
       event that any materials/services are to be imported from the United 
       States for the performance of the Work; and

       b)  include this clause in subcontracts with Canadian suppliers, and 
       quote the DSS Contract (file) number therein.

Failure to take the above actions shall jeopardize the Contractor's 
   delivery commitments.  Therefore, the Contractor assumes sole 
   responsibility for any breach of this Contract which arises from such 
   failure.
