<pre>The Contractor's certification that the price/rate is not in excess of the 
   lowest price/rate charged anyone else, including the Contractor's most 
   favoured customer, for like quality and quantity of the products/
   services, is subject to verification by government audit, at the 
   Minister's discretion, before or after payment is made to the Contractor 
   under the terms and conditions of the Contract.  If the said audit 
   demonstrates that the certification is in error, it is agreed that the 
   Contractor shall make repayment to Canada in the amount found to be in 
   excess of the lowest price.
