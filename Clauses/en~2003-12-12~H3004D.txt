              no payment shall be made to the Contractor unless or until 
              the Contractor, if required to do so, establishes to the 
              satisfaction of the Minister that:

              (a)    the Contractor is not, in the ordinary course of 
                     business, delinquent in discharging any accrued 
                     liabilities that have arisen under this Contract,

              (b)    the Minister's payment shall be used only to discharge 
                     such liabilities, and

              (c)    upon such discharge, the materials, parts, work in 
                     process, and finished work shall be free from all 
                     claims, liens, charges, or encumbrances.

       4      In case of finished work, Canada shall make no payment to the 
              Contractor unless or until such finished work has been

              Contract."
