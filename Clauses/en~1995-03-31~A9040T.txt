       visit will be held on _____, at _____, and bidders should 
       communicate with the Contracting Authority prior to the visit to 
       confirm attendance. Bidders who, for any reason, cannot attend at 
       the specified date and time will not be given an alternative 
       appointment to view the site and their bids, therefore, will be
