<li value="1"><strong>Financial Capability Requirement</strong>:
The Offeror must have the financial capability to fulfill this
requirement. To determine the Offeror's financial capability, the
Standing Offer Authority may, by written notice to the Offeror,
require the submission of some or all of the financial information
detailed below during the evaluation of offers. The Offeror must
provide the following information to the Standing Offer Authority
within fifteen (15) working days of the request or as specified by
the Standing Offer Authority in the notice:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">Audited financial statements, if available, or the
unaudited financial statements (prepared by the Offeror's outside
accounting firm, if available, or prepared in-house if no external
statements have been prepared) for the Offeror's last three fiscal
years, or for the years that the Offeror has been in business if
this is less than three years (including, as a minimum, the Balance
Sheet, the Statement of Retained Earnings, the Income Statement and
any notes to the statements).</li>
<li value="2">If the date of the financial statements in (a) above
is more than five months before the date of the request for
information by the Standing Offer Authority, the Offeror must also
provide, unless this is prohibited by legislation for public
companies, the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a
Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement), as of two
months before the date on which the Standing Offer Authority
requests this information.</li>
<li value="3">If the Offeror has not been in business for at least
one full fiscal year, the following must be provided:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">the opening Balance Sheet on commencement of business
(in the case of a corporation, the date of incorporation); and</li>
<li value="2">the last quarterly financial statements (consisting of a
Balance Sheet and a year-to-date Income Statement) as of two months
before the date on which the Standing Offer Authority requests this
information.</li></ol>
</li><li value="4">A certification from the Chief Financial Officer or
an authorized signing officer of the Offeror that the financial
information provided is complete and accurate.</li>
<li value="5">A confirmation letter from all of the financial
institution(s) that have provided short-term financing to the
Offeror outlining the total of lines of credit granted to the
Offeror and the amount of credit that remains available and not
drawn upon as of one month prior to the date on which the Standing
Offer Authority requests this information.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the Offeror is a joint venture, the financial
information required by the Standing Offer Authority must be
provided by each member of the joint venture.</li>
<li value="3">If the Offeror is a subsidiary of another company,
then any financial information in 1. (a) to (e) above required by
the Standing Offer Authority must be provided by the ultimate
parent company. Provision of parent company financial information
does not satisfy the requirement for the provision of the financial
information of the Offeror, and the financial capability of a
parent cannot be substituted for the financial capability of the
Offeror itself unless an agreement by the parent company to sign a
Parental Guarantee, as drawn up by Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC), is provided with the required
information.</li>
<li value="4"><strong>Financial Information Already Provided to
<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr></strong>: The Offeror is not required to resubmit any
financial information requested by the Standing Offer Authority
that is already on file at <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with the Contract Cost Analysis,
Audit and Policy Directorate of the Policy, Risk, Integrity and
Strategic Management Sector, provided that within the above-noted
time frame:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Offeror identifies to the Standing Offer
Authority in writing the specific information that is on file and
the requirement for which this information was provided; and</li>
<li value="2">the Offeror authorizes the use of the information for
this requirement.</li></ol>
It is the Offeror's responsibility to confirm with the Standing
Offer Authority that this information is still on file with
<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.
</li>
<li value="5"><strong>Other Information:</strong> Canada reserves
the right to request from the Offeror any other information that
Canada requires to conduct a complete financial capability
assessment of the Offeror.</li>
<li value="6"><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> If the Offeror
provides the information required above to Canada in confidence
while indicating that the disclosed information is confidential,
then Canada will treat the information in a confidential manner as
permitted by the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/" rel="external">Access to Information Act</a></cite>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes">R.S.</abbr>,
1985, <abbr title="chapter">c</abbr>. A-1, Section 20(1) (b) and (c).</li>
<li value="7"><strong>Security:</strong> In determining the
Offeror's financial capability to fulfill this requirement, Canada
may consider any security the Offeror is capable of providing, at
the Offeror's sole expense (for example, an irrevocable letter of
credit from a registered financial institution drawn in favour of
Canada, a performance guarantee from a third party or some other
form of security, as determined by Canada).</li>
