       the Consultant's financial obligations for Services rendered to the 
       Consultant or on the Consultant's account, in connection with the 
       Agreement, have been satisfied, before any further payment is made.

                     from the claimant; or

              (ii)   performed the last of the Services pursuant to the

       pursuant to the provision of paragraph 5.

       satisfy all lawful claims against the Consultant for Services
