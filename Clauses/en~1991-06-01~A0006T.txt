<pre>As opposed to an Invitation to Tender, this is a  request [commonly 
   referred to as a Request for Proposal (RFP)] that proposals be developed 
   and submitted to the Minister of Supply and Services setting out the 
   alternative means by which several technical, performance, time and 
   other goals and objectives may be best met, having regard to stated 
   mandatory requirements.  The Minister will consider entering into a 
   contract for the implementation of the most acceptable proposal which 
   will be determined having regard to the evaluation factors set out in 
   this RFP.  In addition, the acceptability of the contract terms and 
   conditions upon which the respondent would be prepared to undertake the 
   implementation of the proposal will be measured against the contract 
   terms and conditions set forth in this RFP.
