<p>The acceptance of vessels must be in accordance with form PWGSC-TPSGC 1205, Acceptance.</p>
<p>The Inspection Authority, in conjunction with the Contractor, will prepare a list of outstanding work items at the end of the work period. This list will form the annexes to the formal acceptance document for the vessel. A contract completion meeting will be convened by the Inspection Authority on the work completion date to review and sign off the Acceptance Document. In addition to any amount held under the Warranty Holdback Clause, a holdback of twice the estimated value of outstanding work will be held until completion of the Work. Applicable Taxes will be calculated on this outstanding work holdback amount and paid at the time that the outstanding work holdback is released.</p>
<p>The Contractor must complete the above form in three (3) copies, which will be distributed by the Contracting Authority as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">original to the Contracting Authority;</li>
<li value="2">one copy to the Technical Authority;</li>
