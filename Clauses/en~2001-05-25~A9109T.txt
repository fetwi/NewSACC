<pre>1.     As a potential supplier to the Government of Canada, an important 
       feature is the Procurement Business Number (PBN) created using the 
       Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Business Number to uniquely 
       identify a company and its branches, divisions, or offices, where 
       appropriate. 

2.     In order to receive a Public Works and Government Services Canada 
       contract, all Canadian firms must have a PBN, or demonstrate that 
       they have applied for one, prior to contract award.  Non-Canadian 
       companies are strongly encouraged to obtain a PBN.  Companies may 
       register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration Information system, 
       on line at the Contracts Canada Internet site: http://
       contractscanada.gc.ca.

3.     For non-Internet registration, please contact one of the Contracts 
       Canada supplier registration agents across Canada.
