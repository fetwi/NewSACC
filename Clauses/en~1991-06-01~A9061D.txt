<pre>When a Contractor subcontracts work, a copy of the Contract procurement 
   order is to be passed to the CFTSD. In addition, the Contractor must 
   monitor progress of subcontracted work and inform the CFTSD on pertinent 
   stages of work to permit inspection when considered necessary by CFTSD.
