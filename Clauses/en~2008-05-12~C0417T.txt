<p>In any vessel refit, repair or docking contract, unscheduled
work will arise after the vessel and its equipment is opened up and
surveyed. The anticipated cost of the Work will be included in the
evaluation of bids. The overall total cost will be calculated by
including an estimated amount of additional person-hours (and/or
material) multiplied by a firm hourly charge-out labour rate and is
added to the firm price for the Work.</p>
<p>The overall total referred to as the "Evaluation Price" will be
used for evaluating the bids. The estimated work will be based on
historical experience and there is no minimum or maximum amount of
unscheduled work nor is there a guarantee of such work.</p>
