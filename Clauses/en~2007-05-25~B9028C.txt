<p>Canada's facilities, equipment, documentation and personnel are not automatically at the disposal of the Contractor. If access to government premises, computer systems (micro computer network), working space, telephones, terminals, documentation and personnel for consultation is required by the Contractor to perform the Work, the Contractor must advise the Contracting Authority of the need for such access in a timely fashion. If the Contractor's request for access is approved by Canada and arrangements are made to provide access to the Contractor, the Contractor, its subcontractors, agents and employees must comply with all the conditions applicable at the Work site. The Contractor must further ensure that the facilities and equipment are used solely for the performance of the Contract.</p>
