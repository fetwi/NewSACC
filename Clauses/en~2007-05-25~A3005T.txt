<pre>The Bidder certifies that, should it be awarded a contract as a result of 
the bid solicitation, every individual proposed in its bid will be 
available to perform the Work as required by Canada's representatives and 
at the time specified in the bid solicitation or agreed to with Canada's 
representatives.  If for reasons beyond its control, the Bidder is unable 
to provide the services of an individual named in its bid, the Bidder may 
propose a substitute with similar qualifications and experience.  The 
Bidder must advise the Contracting Authority of the reason for the 
substitution and provide the name, qualifications and experience of the 
proposed replacement.  For the purposes of this clause, only the following 
reasons will be considered as beyond the control of the Bidder: death, 
sickness, retirement, resignation, dismissal for cause or termination of an 
agreement for default.

If the Bidder has proposed any individual who is not an employee of the 
   Bidder, the Bidder certifies that it has the permission from that 
   individual to propose his/her services in relation to the Work to be 
   performed and to submit his/her résumé to Canada.  The Bidder must, upon 
   request from the Contracting Authority, provide a written confirmation, 
   signed by the individual, of the permission given to the Bidder and of 
   his/her availability.  Failure to comply with the request may result in 
   the bid being declared non-responsive.
