<pre>1.     The Contractor hereby grants to Canada a license to use such of its 
       Background Information that is incorporated into or necessary to 
       perform the Work under this Contract as Canada may require for the 
       alteration or further development of the Work or the Foreground 
       Information, including the right to license or otherwise authorize 
       its use by contractors engaged by Canada for such a purpose. In any 
       such contract, Canada shall restrict the contractor from any use of 
       the Background Information other than in the performance of that 
       contract and shall require the contractor to maintain the 
       confidentiality of the Background Information. For any such 
       Background Information that is not already a deliverable under the 
       Contract or to which Canada does not already have equivalent rights 
       under a previous contract or otherwise, Canada shall pay to the 
       Contractor reasonable compensation for the use. The Contractor shall 
       not, without the written permission of the Minister, incorporate 
       into the Work any Background Information unless it owns or has 
       procured the rights necessary to provide the licenses to Canada set 
       out in this clause or elsewhere in the Contract. Subject to the <em>
       Access to Information Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1, Canada will not 
       release or disclose outside the Government of Canada any such 
       Background Information, other than under a contract referred to in 
       this clause, unless the same information:

       (a)    is publicly available from a source other than the Contractor;

       (b)    is or becomes known to Canada from a source other than the 
              Contractor, except from any source that is known to Canada to 
              be under an obligation to the Contractor not to disclose the 
              information; or

       (c)    is independently developed by or for Canada.
