<pre>1.     All forms supplied for this requirement will be continuous within 
       each carton, with no breaks between forms.

2.     Any breaks that occurred in the manufacturing process are to be 
       spliced with perforated tape or an equivalent method so as to render 
       all forms within a carbon useable. All splices must be flagged at 
       the actual splice location and the outside of the carton must 
       clearly indicate that the contents contain a splice. A maximum of 
       only one (1) splice per carton will be accepted.

3.     On single part forms, a maximum of 10 percent of the total cartons 
       used to fulfill this requirement are allowed to contain a splice.

4.     On two- and three-part forms, a maximum of 12 percent of the total 
       cartons used to fulfill this requirement are allowed to contain a 
       splice.

5.     On forms with four or more parts, a maximum of 20 percent of the 
       total cartons used to fulfill this requirement are allowed to 
       contain a splice.
