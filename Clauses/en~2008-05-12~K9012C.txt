<pre>The section entitled "Conditions precedent to payment" of the general 
conditions is deleted and replaced with the following:

       1.     No payment will be made to the Contractor unless or until 
              invoices, inspection notes, and all other documents required 
              by Canada are submitted in accordance with either the terms 
              of the Contract or the instructions of Canada.

       2.     When costs have been paid by the Contractor, Canada will make 
              no payment to the Contractor unless or until the Contractor, 
              if required by Canada, establishes to the satisfaction of 
              Canada that the materials, parts, work in process, or 
              finished work are free from all claims, liens, attachments, 
              charges, or encumbrances.

       3.     When costs have accrued in the accounts of the Contractor as 
              liabilities to be discharged in the normal course of business, 
              Canada will make no payment to the Contractor unless or until 
              the Contractor, if required by Canada, establishes to the 
              satisfaction of Canada that :

              (a)    the Contractor is not, in the ordinary course of 
                     business, delinquent in discharging any accrued 
                     liabilities that have arisen under the Contract,
                     
              (b)    payment made to the Contractor by Canada under the 
                     Contract will be used only to discharge such 
                     liabilities, and
                     
              (c)    upon such discharge, the materials, parts, work in 
                     process, and finished work will be free from all 
                     claims, liens, charges, or encumbrances.

       4.     For finished work, Canada will make no payment to the 
              Contractor unless or until such finished work has been 
              inspected and accepted in accordance with the terms of the 
              Contract.
