<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>A supply arrangement is a method of supply used by Public Works
and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to procure goods and
services. A supply arrangement is an arrangement between Canada and
pre-qualified suppliers that allows identified users to solicit
bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific
requirements within the scope of a supply arrangement. A supply
arrangement is not a contract for the provision of the goods and
services described in it and neither party is legally bound as a
result of signing a supply arrangement alone. The intent of a
supply arrangement is to establish a framework to permit
expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations which result
in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described
in those bid solicitations.</p>
<p>Except for those procurements where public advertising is not
required or used, Requests for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) are
posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) and
suppliers who are interested in responding to individual bid
solicitations issued under a supply arrangement framework are
invited to submit an arrangement to become pre-qualified suppliers.
The list of pre-qualified suppliers will be used as a source list
for procurement within the scope of the supply arrangement and only
suppliers who are pre-qualified at the time individual bid
solicitations are issued will be eligible to bid. Supply
arrangements include a set of predetermined conditions that will
apply to subsequent bid solicitations and contracts. Supply
arrangements may include ceiling prices which may be lowered based
on an actual requirement or scope of work described in a bid
solicitation.</p>

In addition, Suppliers must respond to Requests for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, and that accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the RFSA, Supply Arrangement (SA), Requests for proposals from SA holders, bid solicitations and any resulting contracts, and submit arrangements, bids as well as enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.
</li>
<li>By submitting an arrangement, Suppliers confirm that they understand that being convicted of certain offences will render them ineligible to be issued a Supply Arrangement or to be awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any arrangement in respect of which the information requested is incomplete or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications is found by Canada to be untrue in any respect, at the time of issuance of the Supply Arrangement (SA). If it is determined by the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr>, after issuance of the SA, that the Supplier made a false declaration, Canada will, following a notice period, have the right to cancel the SA and to terminate for default any resulting contracts. </li>

Suppliers submitting an arrangement as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.</li>
<li>If the required list of names has not been received by the time the evaluation of arrangements is completed, Canada will inform the Supplier of a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to provide the names within the time frame specified will render the arrangement non-responsive. Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for a Supply Arrangement to be issued.</li>
<li>The Supplier must immediately inform Canada in writing of any changes affecting the list of names of directors during this procurement process.</li>
</ol>
</li>

Third Party Validation<br/>

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">An arrangement delivered to the specified bid
receiving unit after the closing date and time but before the
supply arrangement issuance date may be considered, provided the
supplier can prove the delay is due solely to a delay in delivery
that can be attributed to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or
national equivalent of a foreign country). Purolator <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> is not
considered to be part of <abbr title="Canada Post Corporation">CPC</abbr> for the purposes of delayed

<h2 id="customs-clearance">09 (2010-10-07) Customs Clearance</h2>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Supplier to allow sufficient
time to obtain customs clearance, where required, before the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>
closing date and time. Delays related to the obtaining of customs
clearance cannot be construed as "undue delay in the mail" and will
not be accepted as a delayed arrangement under section 07.</p>
<h2 id="legal-capacity">10 (2008-05-12) Legal Capacity</h2>
<p>The Supplier must have the legal capacity to contract. If the

<h2 id="rejection-of-arrangement">12 (2014-09-25) Rejection of Arrangement</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Canada may reject an arrangement where any of the
following circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Supplier is subject to a Vendor Performance
Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which
renders the Supplier ineligible to submit an arrangement for the
requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the
arrangement, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure,
under the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which would render that

the requirement, or the portion of the requirement the employee or
subcontractor is to perform;</li>
<li value="3">the Supplier is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>

<li value="1">Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of
suspension or termination for default with respect to a contract
with the Supplier, any of its employees or any subcontractor
included as part of the arrangement;</li>
<li value="2">Canada determines that the Supplier's performance on other
contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as well as the
extent to which the Supplier performed the Work in accordance with
contractual clauses and conditions, is sufficiently poor to
jeopardize the successful completion of any requirement to be bid
on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject an arrangement
pursuant to a provision of subsection 1. (f), the Supply
Arrangement Authority will so inform the Supplier and provide the
Supplier 10 days within which to make representations, before
making a final decision on the arrangement rejection.</li>
<li value="3">Canada reserves the right to apply additional scrutiny, in particular, when multiple arrangements are received in response to a request for supply arrangements from a single supplier or a joint venture. Canada reserves the right to:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">reject any or all of the arrangements submitted by a single supplier or joint venture if their inclusion in the evaluation has the effect of prejudicing the integrity and fairness of the process, or; </li>
<li value="2">reject any or all of the arrangements submitted by a single supplier or joint venture if their inclusion in the procurement process would distort the solicitation evaluation, and would cause a result that would not reasonably have been expected under prevailing market conditions and/or would not provide good value to Canada.</li>

<h2 id="communications">13 (2014-03-01) Communications - Solicitation Period</h2>

non-responsive.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="joint-venture">16 (2012-03-02) Joint Venture</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">A joint venture is an association of two or more
parties who combine their money, property, knowledge, expertise or
other resources in a single joint business enterprise, sometimes
referred as a consortium, to submit an arrangement together on a
requirement. Suppliers who submit an arrangement as a joint venture
must indicate clearly that it is a joint venture and provide the

<li value="1">the name of each member of the joint venture;</li>
<li value="2">the Procurement Business Number of each member of the
joint venture;</li>
<li value="3">the name of the representative of the joint venture,
i.e. the member chosen by the other members to act on their behalf,
if applicable;</li>
<li value="4">the name of the joint venture, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">If the information is not clearly provided in the
arrangement, the Supplier must provide the information on request
from the Supply Arrangement Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The arrangement must be signed by all the members of
the joint venture unless one member has been appointed to act on
behalf of all members of the joint venture. The Supply Arrangement
Authority may, at any time, require each member of the joint
venture to confirm that the representative has been appointed with
full authority to act as its representative for the purposes of the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> and any resulting supply arrangement.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conflict-of-interest">17 (2012-03-02) Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, suppliers are advised that Canada may reject an
arrangement in the following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Supplier, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> or in any situation of
conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Supplier, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> that was not available to other
suppliers and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or appear to
give the Supplier an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a supplier who is
providing or has provided the goods and services described in the
<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This supplier remains however subject to
the criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject an arrangement under
this section, the Supply Arrangement Authority will inform the
Supplier and provide the Supplier an opportunity to make
representations before making a final decision. Suppliers who are
in doubt about a particular situation should contact the Supply
Arrangement Authority before the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> closing date. By submitting
an arrangement, the Supplier represents that it does not consider
itself to be in conflict of interest nor to have an unfair
advantage. The Supplier acknowledges that it is within Canada's
sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of interest, unfair
advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest or unfair
advantage exists.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="entire-requirement">18 (2008-12-12) Entire Requirement</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> contains all the requirements relating to the request
for arrangements. Any other information or documentation provided
to or obtained by a supplier from any source are not relevant.
Suppliers should not assume that practices used under previous
contracts will continue, unless they are described in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>.
Suppliers should also not assume that their existing capabilities
meet the requirements of the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr> simply because they have met
previous requirements.</p>
<h2 id="further-information">19 (2008-12-12) Further Information</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">For further information, suppliers may contact the
Supply Arrangement Authority identified in the <abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangement">RFSA</abbr>.</li>
