<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Despite any other provision of the Contract
(including the Tariff, if applicable, and the priority of documents
clause in the Articles of Agreement), if, during the contract
period, Canada learns that the Contractor's representations and
warranties set out in section 09 or 15, as applicable, were or are
untrue, the Contractor will be in default of the Contract and
Canada will be entitled to terminate the Contract on thirty (30)
calendar days' notice without any penalty (regardless of whether
Canada has satisfied any minimum work guarantees in the Contract).
The Contractor must pay to Canada its reasonable reprocurement
costs resulting from the termination. However, Canada agrees that
it will only exercise this right of termination if the Contracting
Authority determines that the Contractor's breach of its warranties
and representations has resulted in:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">a negative effect on the services or products to be
provided under the Contract; or</li>

information about a specific ruling, within thirty (30) calendar
days of that request.</li>
<li value="2">If a ruling by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> results in an interpretation
of the Tariff that is inconsistent with the other provisions of the

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Contracting Authority or the Technical
Authority;</li>

Contractor, is seeking the information as an agent of Canada;
however, the Contractor acknowledges that only the Contracting
Authority may designate an individual as an agent of Canada and

is required for the efficient and cost-effective provision of
telephone service and disclosure is made on a confidential basis

<li value="1">Despite any other provision of the Contract
concerning liability, the Contractor's liability with respect to
the provision of 9-1-1 emergency services for wireless
telecommunications (if those services are provided under the
Contract) will be determined as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">The Contractor's liability is not limited by
paragraphs (b) through (d) below, in cases of deliberate fault,
gross negligence or anti-competitive conduct on the part of the
Contractor or in cases of breach of contract where the breach
results from gross negligence of the Contractor.</li>
<li value="2">Except in cases where negligence on the part of the
Contractor results in physical injury, death or damage to Canada's
property or premises, the Contractor's liability for negligence
related to the provision of emergency services is limited to the
greater of $20 and three times the amount Canada would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a refund for the provision of defective
service under the Contract.</li>
<li value="3">In respect of the provision of emergency services,
the Contractor is not liable:
<ol type="i">
<li value="1">for libel, slander, defamation or the infringement of
copyright arising from material or messages transmitted over the
Contractor's telecommunications network from Canada's property or
premises or recorded by Canada's equipment or the Contractor's
equipment,</li>
<li value="2">for damages arising out of the act, default, neglect or
omission of Canada in the use or operation of equipment provided by
the Contractor, or</li>
<li value="3">for damages arising out of the transmission of material or
messages over the Contractor's telecommunications network on behalf
of Canada, which is in any way unlawful.</li>

other companies or telecommunications systems in relation to the
provision of emergency services on a mandatory (i.e., as mandated
by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>) basis to Canada.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">If the Contract has been awarded to the Contractor on
the basis of an interim tariff approval from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>, the
Contractor must not start the Work before receiving final tariff
approval from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>. When it receives final approval, the
Contractor must submit the following to the Contracting Authority:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Tariff in the final form approved by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>;
and</li>
<li value="2">a list of any revisions made to the version of the
Draft Tariff originally submitted with the Contractor's bid and an
explanation of how these revisions affect the Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Canada will review the Contractor's submission and
will determine whether the revisions to the original form of Draft
Tariff submitted with the Contractor's bid affect:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">its compliance with the mandatory requirements of the
bid solicitation that resulted in the contract award;</li>
<li value="2">its score under the rated requirements of the bid
solicitation, if any; or</li>
<li value="3">its ranking compared to other bidders in accordance
with the evaluation process described in the bid solicitation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">If Canada determines that the Contractor remains
compliant to the requirements of the bid solicitation and that its
ranking compared to other bidders has been unaffected by the
revisions to the Draft Tariff, Canada will advise the Contractor to
proceed with the Work.</li>
<li value="4">If Canada determines that, as a result of the
revisions to the Draft Tariff, the Contractor is either no longer
compliant or would no longer have been the top-ranked bidder under
the evaluation process described in the bid solicitation, Canada
may terminate the Contract for default, without any cost or penalty
to Canada, and proceed to consider the next-ranked bid for contract
award under the provisions of the bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="5">Unless the Contractor receives approval sooner,
Canada will allow no less than the following time period following
the date of the Contract for the Contractor to obtain final
approval of the Draft Tariff:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> granted the interim approval on the basis
of an ex parte application, no fewer than seventy (70) working days
following the date of the Contract; or</li>
<li value="2">if the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> granted the interim approval on the basis
of a public process, no fewer than fifty-five (55) working days
following the date of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Contractor fails to obtain final approval of the Draft
Tariff from the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> in this time period, Canada will be entitled
to terminate the Contract for default, without cost or penalty, and
proceed to consider the next-ranked bid for contract award.</p>

<li value="1">Canada acknowledges that non-forborne
telecommunications services and products are required to be
provided in accordance with the applicable tariffs approved by the
<abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>. However, the Contractor warrants that:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Tariff consists of the only tariff(s) that apply
to the provision of the services and products to be provided under
the Contract;</li>
<li value="2">the Tariff does not contain any rate ranges and all
prices listed in the Tariff are firm prices or, if the Tariff does
include rate ranges, the Tariff includes a clause expressly stating
that, despite the rate range in the Tariff, all prices under a
contract are firm prices for the entire duration of the contract
and cannot be changed without the written consent of the customer
(meaning that the Contractor cannot change the prices charged under
the Contract, even within the rate range established in the Tariff,
without the Contracting Authority's consent in writing);</li>
<li value="3">the non-forborne services and products to be provided
under the Contract and the rates at which those services and
products will be provided are in accordance with the Tariff;</li>
<li value="4">the Tariff is not inconsistent with any other
provisions of the Contract; and</li>
<li value="5">the Contractor has sought and obtained all necessary

<h3 id="contractor-not-to-file-amendments-to-tariff-without-consent">4005 10 (2008-05-12) Contractor not to File Amendments to
Tariff without Consent</h3>
<p>If the Contract was awarded as a result of a competitive
process, the Contractor agrees that it will not, on its own
initiative, seek any amendment to any tariff (including any general
tariff, special facilities tariff or customer-specific tariff) that
forms part of the Tariff without the Contracting Authority's prior
written consent. If the Contractor makes an amendment that results
in the Tariff no longer being consistent with the other provisions
of the Contract, the Contractor will be in breach of the warranties
and representations set out in section 09 or 15, as applicable.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-the-crtc-mandated-amendments-to-the-tariff">4005 11 (2008-05-12) Effect of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission-Mandated Amendments to the

<p>If the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>, on its own initiative, directs the Contractor to
amend the Tariff, the Contractor will not be considered to be in
breach of the warranties and representations set out in the section
of this Part entitled "Telecommunications Warranties and
Representations". However, interpretations by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> of the
Tariff will not be considered to be <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>-initiated amendments to
the Tariff unless the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> specifically orders that the Tariff be
amended as a result of its order. An order by the <abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr> that the
conditions of the Contract be amended to conform to the Tariff
(without amending the Tariff itself) is not considered to be a
<abbr title="Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</abbr>-initiated amendment to the Tariff and will constitute a breach
of the warranties and representations set out in section 09 or 15,
as applicable.</p>
<h3 id="limitation-of-liability-for-tariffed-telecommunications-services-and-products">4005 12 (2008-05-12) Limitation of Liability for Tariffed

concerning limitation of liability continue to apply to all other
services or products to which the Tariff does not expressly
apply.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Despite the contract period and the provisions of the
General Conditions concerning termination for convenience in whole
or in part, Canada has the right to terminate the Contract for
convenience with thirty (30) calendar days' written notice, at no
cost to Canada. If Canada terminates for convenience, Canada will
be responsible only to pay for the services or products delivered
and accepted up to the date of termination. However, Canada
acknowledges that, if it exercises its right to terminate for
convenience in respect of telecommunications services or products
subject to the Tariff, where the price for that specific service or
product is associated with a minimum term for the service, any
termination charges specified in the Tariff will apply.</li>
<li value="2">In addition to the amount payable under subsection 1,
if Canada terminates the Contract in whole or in part for
convenience in whole or in part as a result of any decision or
recommendation of a tribunal or court that the Contract be
cancelled, re-tendered or awarded to another supplier, Canada
agrees to reimburse the Contractor for any reasonable costs
incurred by the Contractor to perform the portion of the Work that
has been terminated (if those costs are not otherwise recoverable
in accordance with the Basis of Payment article of the Contract),
provided that the Contractor demonstrates to Canada that these
costs:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">were properly incurred to perform the portion of the
Work that has been terminated and relate exclusively to the
Contract;</li>
<li value="2">were incurred between the date the Contract was

these circumstances, despite any Minimum Work Guarantee included in
the Contract.

<li value="2">If the Contractor continues to be required by law to

only some locations, Canada may choose to have the conditions of
the Tariff apply only to those locations.</li>
<li value="3">At the time the conditions of the former Tariff cease
