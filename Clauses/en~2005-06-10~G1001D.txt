<pre>1.     It shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to decide 
       whether or not any other insurance coverage, in addition to the 
       insurance requirements stipulated in the bid solicitation and 
       resulting contract, is necessary for its own protection or to 
       fulfill its obligations under the Contract.  Any such insurance 
       shall be provided and maintained by the Contractor at its own 
       expense.

       The insurance stipulation contained herein shall not limit any 
       insurance required by federal, provincial or municipal law.  The 
       required insurance is to the benefit and protection of the 
       Contractor and shall not be deemed to release or diminish its 
       liability in any manner including as may be referenced elsewhere by 
       the provisions of this Contract.

2.     To meet the insurance requirements of the Contract, the Contractor 
       shall forward to the Contracting Authority, upon the execution of 
       the Contract, or within ten (10) days thereof; a Certificate of 
       Insurance containing reasonable detail of the insurance coverage, 
       exclusions, deductibles and conditions applying to such policies and 
       confirming that the insurance is in force to meet these requirements 
       or, at the request of the Contracting Authority, a certified true 
       copy of all applicable insurance policies.
