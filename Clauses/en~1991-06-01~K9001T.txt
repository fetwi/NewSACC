3.     Definition of joint venture

       A joint venture is an association of two or more parties who combine 
       their money, property, knowledge, skills, time or other resources in 
       a joint business enterprise agreeing to share the profits and the 
       losses and each having some degree of control over the enterprise. 
       Joint ventures may be carried on in a variety of legal forms divided 
       into three categories:

       (a)    the incorporated joint venture;
       (b)    the partnership venture;
       (c)    the contractual joint venture where the parties combine their 
              resources in the furtherance of a single business enterprise 
              without actual partnership or corporate designation.

4.     The joint venture team arrangement is to be distinguished from other 
       types of contractor arrangements, such as:

       (a)    prime contractor, in which, for example, the purchasing 
              agency contracts directly with a contractor (prime) who acts 
              as the system assembler and integrator, with major components, 
              assemblies and subsystems normally subcontracted; 
       (b)    associated contractor, in which for example, the purchasing 
              agency contracts directly with each of the major component 
              suppliers and performs the integration tasks or awards a 
              separate contract for this purpose.
