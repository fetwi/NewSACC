<pre>1.     Notwithstanding any other clause in the Contract but subject to the 
       remaining provisions of 1 and 2 of this clause, the Contractor's 
       total cumulative liability to Canada for all losses or damage 
       suffered by Canada as a result of all breaches of the Contractor's 
       obligations under the Contract or the faulty carrying out of the 
       Contract (including any such liability in tort, negligence or any 
       other cause of action) shall be limited to __________ <strong>(insert $ 
       amount)</strong> **

       **<strong>Note</strong>:       <strong>It is preferable to add the following wording for 
                     multi year service contracts</strong>: "for losses or damage 
                     caused in any one year of carrying out of the Contract, 
                     each such year starting on the date of coming into 
                     force of the Contract or its anniversary".

       The foregoing limitation shall not apply: 

       (a)    to any breach of the repair or replacement or rework warranty 
              obligations of the Contract,

       (b)    to any breach of intellectual property rights that results in 
              Canada losing in whole or in part the enjoyment of anything 
              delivered under the Contract, or 

       (c)    to any liability of Canada to a third party.

2.     The Contractor agrees to indemnify and save harmless Canada, the 
       Minister and their servants and agents from and against any claim, 
       action, suit or other proceeding or any loss or damage for which 
       they or any of them may be liable to another person arising out of 
       the Contractor's faulty carrying out of or breach of the Contract, 
       except that Canada and the Minister shall not claim such indemnity 
       to the extent that the loss or damage has been caused by Canada.  
       The Minister shall give notice to the Contractor of any such claim, 
       action, suit or proceeding and the Contractor shall, to the extent 
       requested by the Attorney General of Canada, at its ownÂ expense 
       participate in or conduct the defence of the claim, action, suit or 
       proceeding and any negotiations for settlement of the same with all 
       reasonable assistance and co-operation by Canada, but the Contractor 
       shall not be liable to indemnify Canada for payment of any 
       settlement unless it has consented to the settlement.
