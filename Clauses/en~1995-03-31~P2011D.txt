<pre>1.     The price of paper, as indicated in this Contract, is subject to 
       fluctuation, as provided by the following, in the event the 
       Contractor's Published Price List varies between the date of this 
       Contract and the date of first shipment.

2.     In the event such a fluctuation is envisaged by the Contractor, the 
       latter shall provide to the Contracting Authority written notice 
       thereof, along with a copy of its proposed Published Price List, at 
       least twenty (20) days prior to the date of first delivery.

3.     Canada has the sole right to either accept the proposed price change, 
       or to refuse the change. Refusal implies that the Contract is ipso 
       facto annulled "ab initio" (retroactively, as if it never had 
       existed), with no costs or liabilities to any party. The right of 
       Canada shall be exercised in writing, be sent to the Contractor 
       within ten (10) days of receipt of the Contractor's notice of price 
       fluctuation, regardless if some or all paper has then been delivered. 
       In the case of refusal, and if some paper has been delivered, all 
       unused paper shall be returned to the Contractor, at Canada's cost, 
       and used paper shall be paid for at the new published price.

4.     Acceptance of the price fluctuation will be evidenced by a contract 
       amendment. Until such an amendment is issued, prices are not to be 
       invoiced at a different rate than the rate stated in this Contract.
