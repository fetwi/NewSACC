GI11, Canada may reject a bid if any of the following circumstances
is present:

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Bidder's bidding privileges are suspended or are
in the process of being suspended;</li>
<li value="2">the bidding privileges of any employee or
subcontractor included as part of the bid are suspended or are in
the process of being suspended, which suspension or pending
suspension would render that employee or subcontractor ineligible
to bid on the Work, or the portion of the Work the employee or
subcontractor is to perform;</li>
<li value="3">the Bidder is bankrupt, or where for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li value="4">evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has been received with respect to the Bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of its bid;</li>

<li value="6">with respect to current or prior transactions with
Canada

<ol type="i">
<li value="1">Canada has exercised, or intends to exercise, the contractual remedy of taking the work out of the contractor's hands with respect to a contract with the Bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of its bid; or</li>
<li value="2">Canada determines that the Bidder's performance on other contracts is sufficiently poor to jeopardize the successful completion of the requirement being bid on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="3">In assessing the Bidder's performance on other
contracts pursuant to subparagraph 2)(f)(ii) of GI11, Canada may

</li>
<li value="4">Without limiting the generality of paragraphs 1), 2)
and 3) of GI11, Canada may reject any bid based on an unfavourable
assessment of the
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">adequacy of the bid price to permit the work to be
carried out and, in the case of a bid providing prices per unit,
whether each such price reasonably reflects the cost of performing
the part of the work to which that price applies;</li>

structure, skilled personnel, experience and equipment to perform
competently the work under the Contract; and</li>

the Bidder and provide the Bidder ten (10) days within which to
make representations, before making a final decision on the bid
rejection.</li>

variation of the bid from the exact requirements set out in the Bid
Documents can be corrected or waived without being prejudicial to
other Bidders.</li>

<h2 id="conflict-of-interest-unfair-advantage">GI17 (2011-05-16) Conflict of Interest - Unfair Advantage</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">In order to protect the integrity of the procurement
process, bidders are advised that Canada may reject a bid in the
following circumstances:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees was involved in any
manner in the preparation of the bid solicitation or in any
situation of conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of
interest;</li>
<li value="2">if the Bidder, any of its subcontractors, any of
their respective employees or former employees had access to
information related to the bid solicitation that was not available
to other bidders and that would, in Canada's opinion, give or
appear to give the Bidder an unfair advantage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">The experience acquired by a bidder who is providing
or has provided the goods and services described in the bid
solicitation (or similar goods or services) will not, in itself, be
considered by Canada as conferring an unfair advantage or creating
a conflict of interest. This bidder remains however subject to the
criteria established above.</li>
<li value="3">Where Canada intends to reject a bid under this
section, the Contracting Authority will inform the Bidder and
provide the Bidder an opportunity to make representations before
making a final decision. Bidders who are in doubt about a
particular situation should contact the Contracting Authority
before bid closing. By submitting a bid, the Bidder represents that
it does not consider itself to be in conflict of interest nor to
have an unfair advantage. The Bidder acknowledges that it is within
Canada's sole discretion to determine whether a conflict of
interest, unfair advantage or an appearance of conflict of interest
or unfair advantage exists.</li>
