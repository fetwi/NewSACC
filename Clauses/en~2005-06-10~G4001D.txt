<pre>1.     The Contractor shall not provide a domestic aircraft charter service 
       or an international aircraft charter service to Canada unless, for 
       every incident related to the Contractor's operation of that service, 
       it has:

       (a)    liability insurance covering risks of injury to or death of 
              passengers in an amount that is not less than the amount 
              determined by multiplying $300,000 by the number of passenger 
              seats on board the aircraft engaged in the service, or in 
              accordance with regulatory agreements and acts, whichever is 
              greater;

       (b)    insurance covering risks of public liability in an amount 
              that is not less than:

              (i)    $1,000,000, where the Maximum Certified Take-off 
                     Weight (MCTOW) of the aircraft engaged in the service 
                     is not greater than 3.17 kg;

              (ii)   $2,000,000, where the MCTOW of the aircraft engaged in 
                     the service is greater than 3.17 kg but not greater 
                     than 8.16 kg; and,

              (iii)  where the MCTOW of the aircraft engaged in the service 
                            is greater than 8.16 kg, $2,000,000 plus an 
                            amount determined by multiplying $150 by the 
                            number of pounds by which the MCTOW of the 
                            aircraft exceeds 8.15 kg.

2.     The insurance coverage required by subsection 1.(a) need not extend 
       to any passenger who is an employee of the Contractor if workers' 
       compensation legislation governing a claim for damages against that 
       Contractor by the employee is applicable.

3.     The following endorsements must be included:

       (a)    Additional Insured:  Canada is named as an additional insured 
              under any liability insurance policies for Canada's 
              respective rights and interests under the Contract.

              The interest of Canada as additional insured should read as 
              follows: Canada, represented by ________ (<strong class="wsStyleUnderline">insert client 
              department's name</strong>) and/or Public Works and Government 
              Services Canada.

       (b)    Notice of Cancellation or Amendment:  The Insurer agrees to 
              provide the Contracting Authority thirty (30) days written 
              notice of cancellation.

       (c)    Cross Liability:  Without increasing the limit of liability, 
              the policy shall protect all insured parties to the full 
              extent of coverage provided.  Further, the policy shall apply 
              to each Insured in the same manner and to the same extent as 
              if a separate policy had been issued to each.

       (d)    Contractual Liability:  The policy shall, on a blanket basis 
   or by specific reference to this contract, extend to assumed liabilities 
   with respect to contractual insurance provisions.
