              work,

       13.3.2 the timeliness of completion of the work, and

       13.3.3 the Tenderer's overall management of the work and its effect 
              on the level of effort demanded of the department and its 
              representatives.

              part of the Tender, has been convicted under section 121 ("
              Frauds on the government" &amp; "Contractor subscribing to 
              election fund"), 124 ("Selling or purchasing office") or 418

       13.4.3 the bidding privileges of any employee or subcontractor 
              included as part of the Tender have been suspended or are in 
              the process of being suspended, which suspension or pending 
              suspension would render that employee or subcontractor 
              ineligible to bid on the Work, or the portion of the Work the 
              employee or subcontractor is to perform;

       13.4.4 with respect to current or prior transactions with the 
              Government of Canada

              13.4.4.1      the Tenderer is bankrupt or where, for whatever 
                     reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an 
                     extended period;

              13.4.4.2      evidence, satisfactory to Her Majesty, of fraud, 
                     bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to 
                     comply with any law protecting individuals against any 
                     manner of discrimination, has been received with 
                     respect to the Tenderer, any of its employees or any 
                     subcontractor included as part of its Tender;

              13.4.4.3      the Minister has previously exercised or 
                     intends to exercise the contractual remedy of taking 
                     the work out of the contractor's hands with respect to 
                     a Contract with the Tenderer, any of its employees or 
                     any subcontractor included as part of its Tender; or

              13.4.4.4      Her Majesty determines that the Tenderer's 
                     performance on other contracts, including the 
                     efficiency and workmanship as well as the extent to 
                     which the Tenderer executed the work in accordance 
                     with contractual terms and conditions, is sufficiently 
                     poor to jeopardize the successful completion of the  
                     requirement being bid on. 
13.5   Where Her Majesty intends to reject a Tender pursuant to a provision 
       of clause 13.4, other than subclause 13.4.2, the Minister will so 
       inform the Tenderer and provide the Tenderer ten (10) days within
