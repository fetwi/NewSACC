<pre>The following clauses must be incorporated into the conditions of the 
Contractor's Errors and Omissions Liability and Product Liability coverages:

       (A)    "<em>Litigation Rights</em>:  It is understood and agreed that where 
              any suit is instituted for or against Canada which the 
              Insurer, or Insurers would, but for this clause, have the 
              right to pursue or defend on behalf of Canada under this 
              insurance policy, the Insurer shall promptly contact the 
              Attorney General of Canada to agree on the legal strategies 
              by sending a registered letter, or by courier with 
              acknowledgement of receipt, to:

              Senior General Counsel
              Civil Litigation Section
              Department of Justice
              East Memorial Building
              284 Wellington Street, 2nd Floor
              Ottawa, Ontario  K1A 0H8

              The notification must be followed, within a reasonable period, 
              by an information copy to the Contracting Authority.

              The Insurer also agrees that Canada reserves the right to 
              co-defend any action brought against Canada.  However, all 
              expenses incurred by Canada to co-defend such actions would 
              be at Canada's expense."

       (B)    "<em>Notice of Cancellation or Amendments of Insurance Coverage</em>:  
              The Insurer agrees to give the Contracting Authority at least 
              fifteen (15) days' prior written notice of any policy 
              cancellation or any changes in the policy coverage."
