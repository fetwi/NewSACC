<pre>Compliance with the certifications bidders provide to Canada is subject to 
   verification by Canada during the bid evaluation period (before award of 
   a contract) and after contract award.  The Contracting Authority will 
   have the right to ask for additional information to verify the bidders' 
   compliance with the certifications before award of a contract.  The bid 
   will be declared non-responsive if any certification made by the Bidder 
   is untrue, whether made knowingly or unknowingly.  Failure to comply 
   with the certifications or to comply with the request of the Contracting 
   Authority for additional information will also render the bid 
   non-responsive.
