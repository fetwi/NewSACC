4.     The Offeror acknowledges that the Minister relies upon such 
       representation and warranty to evaluate offers and to enter into any 
       contract resulting from this request for standing offers.  Such 
       representation and warranty of Canadian content may be verified in 
       such manner as Canada may reasonably require.

5.     Should a verification by Canada disclose a breach of such covenant, 
       Canada will have the right to treat any contract resulting from the 
       Standing Offer as being in default.

6.     Failure to execute this representation and warrantee on the 
       signature block immediately following this paragraph and to include 
       it with the offer will render the offer non-responsive.
