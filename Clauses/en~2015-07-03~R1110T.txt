<li>
Public Interest Exception<br/>

<li value="1">Technical components of Phase Two proposals are
reviewed, evaluated and rated by a <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Evaluation Board in
accordance with the criteria, components and weight factors set out
in the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr>. Upon completion of the evaluation, Phase Two Technical
Ratings are established.</li>
<li value="2">Phase One Rating and Phase Two Technical Rating are
combined to establish a Combined Technical Score. Proposals
achieving the minimum Combined Technical Score specified in the
Submission Requirements and Evaluation section of the <abbr title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr> are
further considered.</li>
<li value="3">The price envelopes of all responsive proposals are
opened upon completion of the technical evaluation. When there are
three or more responsive proposals, an average price is determined
by adding all the price proposals together and dividing the total
by the number of price proposals opened. This calculation will not
be conducted when one or two responsive proposals are
received.</li>
<li value="4">All price proposals which are greater than 25 percent
above the average price will cause their respective complete

<li value="5">The remaining price proposals are rated as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">The lowest price proposal receives a Price Rating of
100.</li>
<li value="2">The second, third, fourth and fifth lowest prices
receive Price Ratings of 80, 60, 40, and 20 respectively. All other
price proposals receive a Price Rating of 0.</li>
<li value="3">On the rare occasion where two (or more) price
proposals are identical, these price proposals receive the same
rating and the corresponding number of following ratings are
skipped.</li>
<li value="4">The Price Rating is multiplied by a predetermined
percentage factor to establish a Price Score.</li>

</li>
<li value="6">A price proposal in excess of any maximum funding
