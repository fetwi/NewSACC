                         <strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT</strong><strong></strong>

TO:    HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA ("CANADA"), AS REPRESENTED 
       BY THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES

The description of the requirement of bid solicitation No. ______ contains 
information that is confidential or proprietary to Canada or to a third 
party (the Confidential Information) that is not to be disclosed or used in 
any way other than as set out below.

The Bidder agrees that:

(a)    it must not, without first obtaining the  written permission of the 
       Contracting Authority, disclose to anyone, other than an employee or 
       a proposed subcontractor with a need to know, the Confidential 
       Information;

(b)    it must not make copies of the Confidential Information or use it 
       for any purpose other than for the preparation of a bid in response 
       to the bid solicitation identified above;

(c)    at closing date, it must immediately deliver the Confidential 
       Information to the Contracting Authority as well as  every draft, 
       working paper and note that contains any information related to the 
       Confidential Information.

The Bidder must require any proposed subcontractor referred to in (a) above 
to execute a Confidentiality  Agreement on the same conditions as those 
contained in this agreement.

The Bidder acknowledges and agrees that it will be liable for any and all 
claims, loss, damages, costs, or expenses incurred or suffered by Canada 
caused by the failure of the Bidder, or by anyone to whom the Bidder 
discloses the Confidential Information to comply with these conditions.

Nothing in this Confidentiality Agreement should be construed as limiting 
the Bidder's right to disclose any information to the extent that such 
information:

(a)    is or becomes in the public domain through no fault of the Bidder or 
       any proposed subcontractor;

(b)    is or becomes known to the Bidder from a source other than Canada, 
       except any source that is known to the Bidder to be under an 
       obligation to Canada not to disclose the information;

(c)    is independently developed by the Bidder; or

(d)    is disclosed under compulsion of a legislative requirement or any 
       order of a court or other tribunal having jurisdiction.
