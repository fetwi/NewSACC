<pre>1.     Persons and companies in Canada are bound by economic sanctions 
       imposed by Canada.  As a result, the Government of Canada cannot 
       accept delivery of goods or services that originate, either directly 
       or indirectly, from the countries subject to economic sanctions.  
       Details on existing sanctions can be found at:

2.     It is a condition of this Standing Offer and of any ensuing call-ups, 
       if any, that the Offeror not supply to the Government of Canada any 
       goods or services which are subject to economic sanctions.

3.     By law, the Offeror must comply with changes to the regulations 
       imposed during the life of the Standing Offer.  During the 
       performance of any call-up under the Standing Offer, should the 
       addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries or the 
       addition of a good or service to the list of sanctioned goods and 
       services prevent the Offeror from performing all or part of its 
       obligations pursuant to a call-up made against this Standing Offer, 
       the Offeror shall treat the situation as a force majeure.  The 
       Offeror shall forthwith inform Canada of the situation and follow 
       the procedures applicable to force majeure.
