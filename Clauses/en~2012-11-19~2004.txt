<h2>01 (2012-11-09) Code of Conduct and Certifications - Bid</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Bidders must comply with the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external"><cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite></a>. In addition to the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html" rel="external"><cite>Code of Conduct for Procurement</cite></a>, bidders must a) respond to bid solicitations in an honest, fair and comprehensive manner, b) accurately reflect their capacity to satisfy the requirements stipulated in the bid solicitations and resulting contracts, c) submit bids and enter into contracts only if they will fulfill all obligations of the Contract.
</li>
<li value="2">Bidders further understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a contract. Canada will declare non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada. If it is determined, after contract award, that the Bidder made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to terminate the Contract for default. The Bidder will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested. The Bidder and any of the Bidder's affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any contract arising from this bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="3">
<p>
For the purpose of this section, everyone, including but not limited to organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, associations of persons, parent companies, and subsidiaries, whether partly or wholly-owned, as well as individuals, and directors, are Bidder's affiliates if: 
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in this section which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.
</p>
</li>
<li value="4">
<p>
Bidders who are incorporated, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide with their bid or promptly thereafter a complete list of names of all individuals who are currently directors of the Bidder.  Bidders bidding as sole proprietorship, including those bidding as a joint venture, must provide with their bid or promptly thereafter the name of the owner.  Bidders bidding as societies, firms, or partnerships do not need to provide lists of names.  If the required names have not been received by the time the evaluation of bids is completed, Canada will inform the Bidder of a time frame within which to provide the information.  Failure to comply will render the bid non-responsive.  Providing the required names is a mandatory requirement for contract award.
</p>
<p>
Canada may, at any time, request that a Bidder provide properly completed and Signed Consent Forms (<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/forms/formulaires-forms-eng.html#f229" rel="external">Consent to a Criminal Record Verification form - PWGSC-TPSGC 229</a>) for any or all individuals aforementioned within the time specified.

</p>
</li>
<li value="5">The Bidder must diligently maintain an up-to-date list of names by informing Canada in writing of any change occurring during the validity period of the bid as well as during the period of any contract arising from this bid solicitation. The Bidder must also, when so requested, provide Canada with the corresponding Consent Forms.  </li>
<li value="6">By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that it is aware, and that its affiliates are aware, that Canada may request additional information, certifications, consent forms and other evidentiary elements proving identity or eligibility. Canada may also verify the information provided by the Bidder, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="7">By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies that neither the Bidder nor any of the Bidder's affiliates have directly or indirectly, paid or agreed to pay, and will not, directly or indirectly, pay a contingency fee to any individual for the solicitation, negotiation or obtaining of the Contract if the payment of the fee would require the individual to file a return under section 5 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-12.4/" rel="external"><cite>Lobbying Act</cite></a>.</li>
