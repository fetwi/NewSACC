<h2 id="standard-clauses-and-conditions">2029 02 (2008-05-12) Standard clauses and conditions</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-38.2/" rel="external">Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</a></cite>, <abbr title="Statutes of Canada">S.C.</abbr> 1996, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr>16, the clauses and conditions
        identified by number, date and title in the Contract are
        incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though
        expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="status-of-the-contractor">2029 03 (2008-05-12) Status of the Contractor</h2>
<p>The Contractor is an independent Contractor engaged by Canada
        to perform the Work. Neither the Contractor nor any of its
        personnel is engaged as an employee, servant or agent of Canada.
        The Contractor is responsible for all deductions and remittances
        required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h2 id="condition-of-material">2029 04 (2008-05-12) Condition of material</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, material supplied
        must be new and conform to the latest issue of the applicable
        drawing, specification and part number that is in effect on the bid
        solicitation closing date or, if there was no bid solicitation, the
        date of the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="inspection-acceptance-warranty">2029 05 (2014-09-25) Inspection, acceptance and warranty</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Contractor must perform the Work efficiently in
            accordance with standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in
            full conformity with all the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li>All the Work is subject to inspection and acceptance
            by Canada. Despite inspection and acceptance of the Work by or on
            behalf of Canada and without restricting any provisions of the
            Contract or any condition, warranty or provision imposed by law,
            the Contractor, if requested by Canada to do so, must replace,
            repair or correct, at its own option and expense any work that
            becomes defective or fails to conform to the requirements of the
            Contract, where applicable. For goods, the warranty period will be
            12 months after delivery and acceptance of the Work or the
            length of the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty
            period, whichever is longer.</li>
<li>Canada must pay the transportation cost associated
            with returning the Work or any part of the Work to the Contractor's
            plant for replacement, repair or making good, and the Contractor
            must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the
            replacement or returning the Work or part of the Work when
            rectified to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to
            another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of
            Canada, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location,
            the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good
            of the Work at that location and will be reimbursed its reasonable
            travel and living expenses.</li>
<li>The warranty period is automatically extended by the
            duration of any period or periods where the Work is unavailable for
            use or cannot be used because of a defect or non-conformance during
            the original warranty period. The warranty applies to any part of
            the Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to subsection 2,
            for the greater of:
            <ol type="a">
<li>the warranty period remaining, including the
                    extension, or</li>
<li>90 days or such other period as may be
                    specified for that purpose by agreement between the Parties.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="invoice-submission">2029 06 (2013-03-21) Invoice submission</h2>
<ol>
<li>Invoices must be submitted in the Contractor's name.
            The Contractor must submit invoices for each delivery or shipment;
            invoices must only apply to the Contract. Each invoice must
            indicate whether it covers partial of final delivery.</li>
<li>Invoices must show:
            <ol type="a">
<li>the date, the name and address of the client
                    department, item or reference numbers, deliverable/description of the Work, contract number, Client Reference Number
                    (CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN), and financial
                    code(s);</li>
<li>details of expenditures (such as item, quantity, unit of issue, fixed time labour rates and level of effort, subcontracts, as applicable) in accordance with the Basis of Payment, exclusive of Applicable Taxes;</li>
<li>deduction for holdback, if applicable;</li>
<li>the extension of the totals, if applicable; and</li>
<li>if applicable, the method of shipment together with
                    date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, shipment charges
                    and any other additional charges.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Applicable Taxes must be specified on all invoices as a separate item along with corresponding registration numbers from the tax authorities. All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which Applicable Taxes do not apply, must be identified as such on all invoices.</li>
<li>By submitting an invoice, the Contractor certifies
            that the invoice is consistent with the Work delivered and is in
            accordance with the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taxes">2029 07 (2013-03-21) Taxes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
            Federal government departments and agencies are required to pay Applicable Taxes.
        </li>
<li>
            Applicable Taxes will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission section. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to charge Applicable Taxes at the correct rate in accordance with applicable legislation. The Contractor agrees to remit to appropriate tax authorities any amounts of Applicable Taxes paid or due.
        </li>
<li>
            The Contractor is not entitled to use Canada’s exemptions from any tax, such as provincial sales taxes, unless otherwise specified by law. The Contractor must pay applicable provincial sales tax, ancillary taxes, and any commodity tax, on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (in accordance with applicable legislation), including for material incorporated into real property.
        </li>
<li>
            In those cases where Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes are included in the Contract Price, the Contract Price will be adjusted to reflect any increase, or decrease, of Applicable Taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes that will have occurred between bid submission and contract award. However, there will be no adjustment for any change to increase the Contract Price if public notice of the change was given before bid submission date in sufficient detail to have permitted the Contractor to calculate the effect of the change.
        </li>
<li>Tax Withholding of 15 Percent – Canada Revenue Agency
        </li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Act</a></cite>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1 (5th Supp.) and the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945/index.html" rel="external">Income Tax Regulations</a></cite>, Canada must withhold 15 percent of the amount to be paid to the Contractor in respect of services provided in Canada if the Contractor is not a resident of Canada, unless the Contractor obtains a valid waiver from the <cite><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html" rel="external">Canada Revenue Agency</a></cite>. The amount withheld will be held on account for the Contractor in respect to any tax liability which may be owed to Canada.
    </p>
<h2 id="transportation-costs">2029 08 (2010-01-11) Transportation costs</h2>
<p>If transportation costs are payable by Canada under the Contract
        and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments
        must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent
        with normal shipping practice. The costs must be shown as a
        separate item on the invoice.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-carrier-liability">2029 09 (2010-01-11) Transportation carriers' liability</h2>
<p>The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks
        precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for
        transportation beyond the point at which ownership of goods passes
        to the federal government (determined by the <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> point or
        Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without
        charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for
        shipment.</p>
<h2 id="shipment-documentation">2029 10 (2008-05-12) Shipment documentation</h2>
<p>For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading
        must accompany the original invoice, except for "collect" shipments
        (if and when stipulated), in which event it must accompany the
        shipment. In addition, a packing slip must accompany each shipment,
        showing item, quantity, part or reference numbers, description of
        the goods and contract number, including the <abbr title="Client Reference Number">CRN</abbr> and <abbr title="Procurement Business Number">PBN</abbr>. If the
        goods have been inspected at the Contractor's plant, the signed
        inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally
        enclosed in the packing note envelope.</p>
<h2 id="payment-period">2029 11 (2014-09-25) Payment period</h2>
<ol>
<li>Canada's standard payment period is 30 days.
            The payment period is measured from the date an invoice in
            acceptable form and content is received in accordance with the
            Contract or the date the Work is delivered in acceptable condition
            as required in the Contract, whichever is later. A payment is
            considered overdue on the 31st day following that date and interest
            will be paid automatically in accordance with section 12.</li>
<li>If the content of the invoice and its substantiating
            documentation are not in accordance with the Contract or the Work
            is not in acceptable condition, Canada will notify the Contractor
            within 15 days of receipt. The 30-day payment period
            begins upon receipt of the revised invoice or the replacement or
            corrected Work. Failure by Canada to notify the Contractor within
            15 days will only result in the date specified in
            subsection 1 to apply for the sole purpose of calculating interest
            on overdue accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interest-on-overdue-accounts">2029 12 (2008-12-12) Interest on overdue accounts</h2>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of this section:
            <dl>
<dt>"Average Rate"</dt>
<dd>means the simple arithmetic mean of the
                    Bank Rates in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time each day during the
                    calendar month which immediately before the calendar month in which
                    payment is made;</dd>
<dt>"Bank Rate"</dt>
<dd>means the rate of interest established from
                    time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the

                    Payments Association;</dd>
<dt>date of payment"</dt>
<dd>means the date of the negotiable
                    instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada to pay any

<dt>an amount becomes "overdue"</dt>
<dd>when it is unpaid on the first day
                    following the day on which it is due and payable according to the
                    Contract.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Canada will pay the Contractor simple interest at the
            Average Rate plus 3 percent per year on any amount that is overdue,
            from the date that amount becomes overdue until the day before the
            date of payment, inclusive. The Contractor is not required to
            provide notice to Canada for interest to be payable.</li>
<li>Canada will pay interest in accordance with this
            section only if Canada is responsible for the delay in paying the
            Contractor. Canada will not pay interest on overdue advance
            payments.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="audit">2029 13 (2014-09-25) Audit</h2>
<p>The amount claimed under the Contract is subject to government
        audit both before and after payment is made. The Contractor must
        keep proper accounts and records of the cost of performing the Work
        and keep all documents relating to such cost for six years
        after it receives the final payment under the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="compliance-with-applicable-laws">2029 14 (2008-05-12) Compliance with applicable laws</h2>
<p>The Contractor must comply with all laws applicable to the
        performance of the Contract. The Contractor must provide evidence
        of compliance with such laws to Canada at such times as Canada may
        reasonably request.</p>
<p>The Contractor must obtain and maintain at its own costs all
        permits, licences, regulatory approvals and certificates required
        to perform the Work. If requested by the Contracting Authority, the
        Contractor must provide a copy of any required permit, licence,
        regulatory approvals or certificate to Canada.</p>
<h2 id="time-of-the-essence">2029 15 (2008-05-12) Time of the essence</h2>
<p>It is essential the Work be delivered within or at the time
        stated in the Contract.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">2029 16 (2008-05-12) Ownership</h2>
<p>Unless provided otherwise in the Contract, the Work or part of
        the Work belongs to Canada after delivery and acceptance by or on
        behalf of Canada. Despite any transfer of ownership, the Contractor
        is responsible for any loss or damage to the Work or any part of
        the Work until it is delivered to Canada in accordance with the
        Contract.</p>
<h2 id="government-property">2029 17 (2008-05-12) Government Property</h2>
<p>The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care of all
        Government Property while it is in its possession or subject to its
        control. The Contractor is responsible for any loss or damage
        resulting from its failure to do so other than loss or damage
        caused by ordinary wear and tear.</p>
<h2 id="amendment-and-assignment">2029 18 (2008-05-12) Amendment and assignment</h2>
<p>The Contract must not be amended or assigned, in whole or in
        part, without the prior written agreement of the Parties.</p>
<h2 id="default-by-the-contractor">2029 19 (2008-05-12) Default by the Contractor</h2>
<p>If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its
        obligations under the Contract, or is bankrupt or insolvent or in
        receivership, the Contracting Authority may, by giving written
        notice to the Contractor, terminate for default the Contract or
        part of the Contract. Upon the giving of such notice, the
        Contractor will have no claim for further payment and remains
        liable to Canada for all losses and damages suffered by Canada
        because of the default, including any increase in the cost incurred
        by Canada in procuring the Work from another source.</p>
<h2 id="termination-for-convenience">2029 20 (2020-05-28) Termination for convenience</h2>
<ol>
<li>At any time before the completion of the Work, the Contracting Authority may, by giving notice in writing to the Contractor, terminate for convenience the Contract or part of the Contract. Once such a notice of termination for convenience is given, the Contractor must comply with the requirements of the termination notice. If the Contract is terminated in part only, the Contractor must proceed to complete any part of the Work that is not affected by the termination notice. The termination will take effect immediately or, as the case may be, at the time specified in the termination notice.</li>
<li>If a termination notice is given pursuant to subsection 1, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid, for costs that have been reasonably and properly incurred to perform the Contract to the extent that the Contractor has not already been paid or reimbursed by Canada. The Contractor agrees that it will only be paid the following amounts:
            <ol type="a">

The Contractor agrees that it is not entitled to any anticipated profit on any part of the Contract terminated; and</li>
<li>all costs incidental to the termination of the Work incurred by the Contractor but not including the cost of severance payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer required, except wages that the Contractor is obligated by statute to pay.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Canada may reduce the payment in respect of any part of the Work, if upon inspection, it does not meet the requirements of the Contract.</li>
<li>The total of the amounts, to which the Contractor is entitled to be paid under this section, together with any amounts paid, due or becoming due to the Contractor must not exceed the Contract Price. The Contractor will have no claim for damages, compensation, loss of profit, interest, allowance arising out of any termination notice given by Canada under this section except to the extent that this section expressly provides.

        may set-off against any amount payable to the Contractor under the
        Contract, any amount payable to Canada by the Contractor under the
        Contract or under any other current contract. Canada may, when
        making a payment pursuant to the Contract, deduct from the amount
        payable to the Contractor any such amount payable to Canada by the
        Contractor which, by virtue of the right of set-off, may be
        retained by Canada.</p>
