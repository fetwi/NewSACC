<li value="2">	Bidders further understand that, to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in the procurement process, the commission of certain acts or offences will render them ineligible to be awarded a contract.  Canada will declare non-responsive any bid in respect of which the information herein requested is missing or inaccurate, or in respect of which the information contained in the certifications specified hereinafter is found to be untrue, in any respect, by Canada.  If it is determined, after contract award, that the Bidder made a false declaration, Canada will have the right to terminate the Contract for default.  The Bidder will be required to diligently maintain up-to-date the information herein requested.  The Bidder and any of the Bidder's parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, will also be required to remain free and clear of any acts or convictions specified herein during the period of any contract arising from this bid solicitation.  Canada may verify the information provided by the Bidder, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>
<li value="3">	For the purpose of this section, business concerns, organizations and individuals are Bidder's affiliates if:

<ol type="a">
<li value="1">	directly or indirectly either one controls or has the power to control the other, or</li>
<li value="2">	a third party has the power to control both.</li>
</ol>	
Indicia of control, include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, common use of employees, or a business entity created following the acts or convictions specified in this section which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees, as the case may be.
</li>
<li value="4">Bidders must submit the following as part of their bid:

<ol type="a">

</li>
<li value="5">
The Bidder must diligently maintain the list up-to-date by informing Canada in writing of any change occurring during the validity period of the bid, and must also provide Canada with the corresponding Consent Forms.  The Bidder will also be required to diligently maintain the list and to provide Consent Forms during the period of any contract arising from this bid solicitation.</li>
<li value="6">
By submitting a bid, the Bidder certifies to be aware, and that its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates are aware, that Canada may verify the information provided by the Bidder, including the information relating to the acts or convictions specified herein, through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties.</li>

the Bidder must provide, if requested by the Contracting Authority,
a statement and any requested supporting documentation indicating

<li value="1">Canada may reject a bid where any of the following
circumstances is present:
<ol type="a">
<li value="1">the Bidder is subject to a Vendor Performance
Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which
renders the Bidder ineligible to bid on the requirement;</li>
<li value="2">an employee, or subcontractor included as part of the
bid, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under
the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy, which would render that employee or
subcontractor ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion
of the requirement the employee or subcontractor is to
perform;</li>
<li value="3">the Bidder is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>

jeopardize the successful completion of the requirement being bid
on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="2">Where Canada intends to reject a bid pursuant to a
provision of subsection 1. (f), the Contracting Authority will so

Contracting Authority.</li>
<li value="3">The bid and any resulting contract must be signed by
all the members of the joint venture unless one member has been
appointed to act on behalf of all members of the joint venture. The

joint venture to confirm that the representative has been appointed
with full authority to act as its representative for the purposes
of the bid solicitation and any resulting contract. If a contract
