<pre>The supply to CCC by the Contractor under this Contract would constitute a 
   "Zero-rated Supply" as this expression is defined for purposes of the 
   goods and services tax.  Accordingly, the rate of tax in respect thereto 
   would be zero percent (0%) of the value of the consideration for the 
   supply to CCC hereunder.
