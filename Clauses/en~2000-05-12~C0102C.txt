<pre>1.     Notwithstanding the Accounts clause, section 11 of General 
       Conditions - Universities and Other Institutions, DSS-MAS 1053, the 
       Contractor's certification that the price quoted is based on costs 
       computed in accordance with " Research and Development Contracts 
       with Universities and Colleges" is subject to verification.

2.     The purpose of such verification would be to determine that the 
       total price charged by the Contractor on a single contract, where 
       only one exists, or a series of negotiated firm price contracts, 
       where more than one exists, was in accordance with the 
       aforementioned procedures. 

3.     Any payments made pending completion of the verification shall be 
       adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the results of the said 
       verification. If there has been an overpayment, it shall be refunded 
       promptly to Canada.
