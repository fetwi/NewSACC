<p>Section 09 entitled <cite>Warranty of general conditions 2010A</cite> is
amended by deleting subsection 2 in its entirety and replacing it
with the following:</p>
<p>The Contractor must pay the transportation cost
associated with returning the Work or any part of the Work to the
Contractor's plant for replacement, repair or making good. The
Contractor must also pay the transportation cost associated with
forwarding the replacement or returning the Work or part of the
Work when rectified to the delivery point specified in the Contract
or to another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of
Canada, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location,
the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good
of the Work at that location. In such cases, the Contractor will be
responsible for all Costs (including travel and living expenses)
incurred in so doing, Canada will not reimburse these Costs.</p>
<p>All other provisions of the warranty section remain in
effect.</p>
