<pre>1.     The Contract concerns a Canadian defence requirement and therefore 
       is eligible to be assigned a "U.S. Priority Rating" for any 
       materials/services imported from the United States which may be 
       required in the performance of the Work.  Accordingly, the 
       Contractor must:

       (a)    make an application to the Defence Priorities and Allocations 
              Officer, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), 
              either by e-mail at: <a href="mailto:NCR.ACQBDefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">NCR.ACQBDefencePriorities@pwgsc.gc.ca</a>; 
              or by facsimile: 819-956-1459; and

       (b)    include this clause in subcontracts with Canadian contractors, 
              and quote the PWGSC Contract Number indicated in the Contract.

2.     Failure to comply with the above may impact on the Contractor's 
       delivery commitments.  Therefore, the Contractor is responsible for 
       any breach of the Contract that arises from such a failure.
