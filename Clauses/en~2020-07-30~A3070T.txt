<pre><p>The evaluation team will determine if there are two (2) or more bids with a valid Canadian content certification with the bids coming from two or more Bidders that are not affiliated within the meaning used in the <a href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/index.html" rel="external"><cite>Competition Act</cite></a>, <abbr title="Revised Statutes of Canada">R.S.C.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> C-34. In that event, only those bids with a valid certification will be eligible to be awarded a contract; otherwise, all bids will be eligible. If at any point in the evaluation process it is found, whether by determination of invalidity of certifications, determination that bids are non-responsive or withdrawal of bids by Bidders, that there are no longer two (2) or more responsive bids with a valid certification, then all responsive bids will be eligible to be awarded a contract. Canada may conduct the validation of Canadian content certifications at any time in the evaluation process including doing so concurrently with other steps.</p></pre>
